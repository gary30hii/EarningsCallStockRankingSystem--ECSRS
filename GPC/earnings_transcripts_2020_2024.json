At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSid Jones: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company fourth quarter and full year 2020 conference call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Will Stengel, our newly appointed President. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call and webcast include a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations website. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our report as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today\u2019s call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its businesses. The Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company\u2019s latest SEC filings, including this morning\u2019s press release. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Finally, consistent with prior two quarters, we\u2019ve accounted for the Business Products segment, S.P. Richards, as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are all staying safe and well. Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategic actions, despite the continued challenges of COVID-19. The GPC team was agile and adapting to dynamic conditions and executed on our initiatives to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results. We are grateful to our 50,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to excellence, while responding to unprecedented business and economic conditions, which have continued for nearly 12 months. Our operational focus is on ensuring a safe work environment, supporting our talented workforce and further strengthening our strong culture. In January, we\u2019re pleased to promote Will Stengel to President, and we now welcome Will to this quarterly call. As our Chief Transformation Officer since 2019, Will helped our business units work to achieve a variety of strategic initiatives and significant cost savings in 2020. Will\u2019s vast skill set and relevant experience in his previous career with HD Supply, have added tremendous value to our management team. His exceptional talent, proven leadership and experience make Will an excellent choice as our Company\u2019s next President. And we look forward to his future contributions. You will hear from both Will and Carol later in the call, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So, now, turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, down 1% due in part to the continued challenges of COVID-19. While our Automotive sales were strong in Asia Pac, the pace of recovery slowed in Europe and North America relative to the previous quarter. Industrial sales grew progressively stronger during the final three months of 2020 and were much improved from the prior two quarters. We further improved gross margin, and in fact, the fourth quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. In addition, we successfully took action to reduce costs, lowering our year-over-year operating expenses. For the quarter, we generated an additional $40 million in permanent cost savings and realized another $40 million in temporary savings related to our response to COVID-19. Our progress in these areas drove a 14% increase in total operating profit and an 8.8% operating margin. This 110 basis-point improvement in operating margin from the fourth quarter of 2019 was supported by margin expansion in both, the Automotive and Industrial segments. Our strong operating performance drove adjusted net income of $221 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up 20%. Due to ongoing working capital and debt financing initiatives, we also finished the quarter and year with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and robust cash flow with $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020. Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the fourth quarter and Industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. Total sales for the global Automotive Group were $2.8 billion, a 1% increase from 2019, with comp sales down 2%. Segment profit margin was up 130 basis points, driven by improvement in each of our Automotive operations. Fourth quarter sales were led by strong growth in Asia Pac with continued retail and commercial sales momentum driving a second consecutive quarter of mid-teens sales. The Asia Pac team performed well all year and deserves a special shout out on their exceptional results. So, congratulations and a big thank you to Rob Cameron and the entire Automotive team down under. In Europe and North America, the surge in COVID cases led to more restrictions on mobility, and mild weather through most of the quarter pressured sales of seasonal items. A second lockdown in November significantly slowed sales activity across Europe, although sales gradually improved through December, driving flat comps for the quarter. We would add as well that despite the challenging conditions in Europe overall, our UK operations continued to outperform with solid results for the quarter. Additionally, the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives more than offset the sales pressure, and the European team produced a 100 basis-point operating margin improvement. This caps a strong recovery in Europe\u2019s operating performance over the second half of 2020. In North America, our U.S. Automotive total sales and comp sales declined approximately 6%. Despite the sales decrease, the U.S. team generated a 200 basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. In Canada, quarterly sales were down slightly, comp sales declined 2%, and operating margin improved by 40 basis points. Growth in sales for our retail customers continued to outperform expectations, while sales to the DIFM segment remained challenging. Through the quarter, DIY sales were strong, driven by COVID-related shifts in consumer behavior and stimulus payments, and stronger NAPA sales positioning, resulting from several key initiatives. These include our ongoing store refreshes, investment in retail specialists, the benefit of our NAPA rewards program with 12.5 million active members, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising initiatives. In addition, our growing omni-channel capabilities, including direct-to-customers shipping from select suppliers enabled our team to double our online sales volume from pre-pandemic levels. DIFM sales were down from 2019 as a slow recovery in miles driven, mild temperatures and continued pressure in our large fleet and government customers segment weighed on sales demand. To address these declines and build positive momentum in 2021, our team has focused on several initiatives, including maximizing sales force effectiveness by repurposing our field resources and doubling the number of professional salespeople calling directly on our end customers to professional repair garages, continued enhancement of our industry-leading commercial programs and promotions for the professional customers, including NAPA AutoCare and Auto Pro, improving our inventory availability, utilizing enhanced analytics to ensure more parts for more cars across our store network, strengthening in our supply chain, focusing on our global supplier relationships, as well as ensuring we have multiple suppliers by category. While we are seeing gradual improvement with supply chain service issues, there is more work yet to be done, and finally, further optimizing our network, including DC consolidation, increasing automation in our facilities and additional daily shuttles. In 2021, we will also continue to execute on several global initiatives and invest in our omni-channel strategy, both B2B and B2C to enhance and build new digital catalog and search capabilities, implement strategic pricing initiatives, focus on value added services, and continue our rollout of the NAPA brand in Europe and Australasia. We also have plans to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers, and new greenfield stores to enhance our competitive positioning across our automotive operation. These initiatives are designed to deliver customer value, sell more parts, and capture market share. To that end, we are pleased to report a strong start in 2021 with January average daily sales up low double digits in the U.S. and for our global Automotive Group. Backing out the positive impact of FX and acquisition revenues, comp sales were up high single digits in January. We would add that we continue to see little impact of price inflation in our sales, although we expect to see more supplier increases in the coming months and quarters, possibly in the 1 to 3% range for the full year. So, in summary, we believe improving product availability, colder winter weather in North America and Europe, and the gradual reopening of the economy are current tailwinds for automotive business. In addition, favorable industry fundamentals, a growing total vehicle fleet, an increase in vehicles aged 6 to 12 years and expectation for the gradual recovery in miles driven give us confidence in our growth expectations for 2021, despite the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19. So, now, let\u2019s discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group are $1.4 billion, down 3.3% from last year. Comp sales were down 4.4%, a significant improvement from the 9% decrease in Q3 and the 17% decrease we saw back in Q2. The steady recovery in sales over the last half of 2020 is consistent with the gradual improvement in the industrial economy, which is evident in indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production. Strengthening conditions combined with our ongoing initiatives to drive growth and lower costs resulted in a 70 basis-point improvement in the segment profit margin and our strongest quarterly return on sales since the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales in North America and Australasia showed similar sales trends for the fourth quarter overall, although December was the strongest month in the quarter in North America. In addition, most key product categories achieved positive sales growth in December with improved month-to-month sales trends among virtually all the industries that we serve. We expect to build on these favorable trends in 2021. As we move forward into 2021, which is Motion\u2019s 75th year in business, the Industrial team will continue to execute on strategic initiatives to drive profitable sales growth, improve operational productivity and deliver customer value. These initiatives include building out our omnichannel capabilities to drive organic sales; optimize the value of the Motion website and accelerate e-commerce growth; growing our services and solutions business to expand our expertise in areas such as repair, conveyance and automation; ongoing disciplined M&A to further boost our products and service offering, while expanding our global footprint and market presence; enhancing our global pricing and product category management strategies to ensure sales excellence, margin effectiveness and a product offering that evolves the Motion brand globally; and optimizing our global distribution network, the enhanced automation and facility rationalization to lower cost, improve productivity and deliver excellent customer service. We are confident that our focus on these key initiatives will optimize our competitive positioning as the industrial markets recover to full capacity. We are encouraged to see releases of capital project orders that were on hold throughout most of 2020, which is a positive sign for our greater plant activity in the months and quarters ahead. In addition, we are pleased that our supplier service levels are strong, despite extended lead times on select items, and our inventories are in good position to meet expected growing demand. Finally, we currently expect another year of reasonable 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers, which compares to inflation of just under 1% in 2020. For additional perspective, we experienced positive sales momentum in January, with average daily sales up 2% for the month. This is better than the sales trends we reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and is a testament to the great work done by the entire Industrial team. So, despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its uncertain impact on the global economy and our markets, we are confident in our plans for the Industrial segment and look forward to a strong 2021. So, let me conclude by providing an update on our ESG initiatives. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to innovate in ways that also benefit our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. Our ESG practices, including human capital management, and diversity and inclusion are discussed in our 2020 corporate sustainability report. In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a formal human rights policy, which communicates the Company\u2019s commitment to upholding human rights in every location in which we operate as well as our expectation that our suppliers, partners and affiliates also respect human rights. Our Companywide commitment to sustainability is integral to our corporate growth strategy. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view these documents and learn more about our ESG initiatives. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to say that I\u2019m incredibly proud to be a part of Genuine Parts Company. The Company has an impressive history of success, and it\u2019s an honor to be on the GPC leadership team. I\u2019d like to thank Paul and the Board for their vote of confidence. As Paul mentioned, I joined the Company in late 2019 as Chief Transformation Officer. Previously, I held executive leadership positions at HD Supply, including time as President and CEO of HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, and various other strategy and operating roles. My experience in distribution-related businesses fits well with GPC\u2019s portfolio, business model and strategic initiatives, where consistent profitable growth, operating leverage, strong cash conversion, and disciplined capital allocation are all key value drivers, with the dividend an especially important part of the GPC capital allocation strategy. I\u2019m excited about the future potential of Genuine Parts Company. Each of our GPC businesses enjoy leadership positions within attractive fragmented markets with scale and capabilities to win. We have leading global brands and longstanding relationships, based on reliable customer service and value-added expertise. And our unique culture that is based on a clear set of core values and purpose serves as an important common foundation. Strategic actions taken in 2020 accelerated the transformation momentum built over recent years as we work to simplify the business and further define our critical focus areas. The global teams executed well as we navigated the pandemic and demonstrated an ability to act quickly and deliver results. Our strategic actions provided clarity for areas where we want to increase our focus, including profitable organic growth, driving operating productivity through simplification and integration, disciplined and strategic capital deployment and investments in talent to develop and build capabilities. Despite a challenging and unprecedented year, our diverse businesses proved resilient and built solid momentum as we enter 2021. In my new role, I look forward to working with Paul and the global leadership team as we align resources within our focus areas to execute these initiatives and deliver value as a team. I\u2019m also looking forward to spending time in our operations and with our customers and suppliers. In addition, we\u2019ll continue to further refine and advance our longer term strategic roadmap. We\u2019re excited about the numerous potential opportunities that new technologies and emerging trends could present for GPC. As we look to the future, we feel well-positioned to execute our strategic priorities to the benefit of all our stakeholders, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to drive results. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it to Carol for her comments.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Will. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 0.7% from 2019. For the full year, sales were $16.5 billion, down 5.6% or down 2.3%, excluding divestitures. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 35%, a 40 basis-point improvement compared to 34.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin improved 100 basis points to 34.5% from 33.5% in 2019. Our team has been focused on a number of margin-enhancing initiatives, and the fourth quarter and full year gains represent the 13th consecutive quarter and the 5th consecutive year of improved gross margin for the Company. Our steady progress in expanding gross margin in the quarter and the year reflect a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of sales mix shifts to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and strategic category management initiatives. In addition, the full year gross margin also benefited from acquisitions and divestitures, which impacted our results through the nine months. We would add these positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. And finally, as we assess the pricing environment in the fourth quarter and 2020 overall, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our sales and gross margins. As Paul mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll see how this plays out in 2021, but we have not had any impact of inflation to this point in the year. Our adjusted selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 2.8% from last year and representing 26.6% of sales compared to 27.2% last year. For the year, these expenses were $4.4 billion, down 3.9% compared to last year and 26.5% of sales compared to 26% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the favorable impact of our permanent and COVID-related cost actions implemented throughout 2020, as previously discussed. As mentioned on our third quarter conference call, in accordance with our 2019 $100 million cost savings plan, we successfully achieved the $100 million annual target ahead of schedule. We are pleased to report an incremental $40 million in savings recognized in the fourth quarter and $150 million in permanent expense reductions for 2020. In addition, our team continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to the impact of COVID-19. These initiatives contributed temporary cost savings of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Combined, we generated approximately $80 million in total savings during the fourth quarter and approximately $450 million for the full year, driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility costs, as well as temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, government subsidies and other initiatives in response to COVID. We expect our permanent cost savings to carry over into 2021, and we\u2019ll continue to manage our expenses to further improve our cost structure and operating performance. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3.4% from last year. This represents 28.1% of sales, down 80 basis points from 28.9% in 2019. For the full year, these expenses were an adjusted $4.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year and representing 28.4% of sales. Our total segment profit in the fourth quarter was $374 million, up 14% on a 1% sales decrease, and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 7.7% last year for a strong increase of 110 basis points. For the full year, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up 3% compared to 2019, and our segment profit margin was 8.2% compared to 7.8% in the prior year. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2015. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter, and for 2020, net interest was $91 million, which is essentially flat from 2019. In 2021, we expect net interest of $70 million to $72 million, which is down from 2020 due to lower interest rates related to our new debt agreements negotiated in the fourth quarter, as well as the expectation for lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $33 million in the fourth quarter, down from $37 million in 2019, and for the year, these expenses were $150 million. We currently expect our corporate expense to be in the $150 million range again in 2021. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1%, an increase from 24.6% in the prior year period. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5% and in line with 2019. We are planning for a full year tax rate for 2021 in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $172 million with earnings per share of $1.18. Adjusted net income was $221 million or $1.52 per share, which compares to $186 million or $1.27 per share in 2019 or a 20% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $163 million or $1.13 per share, and adjusted net income was $765 million or $5.27 per share. So, now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Segment profit of $240 million was up 19%, with profit margin at 8.5% compared to a 7.2% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 130 basis-point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our Automotive businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so an excellent job of operating by our Automotive team, and we look forward to continued progress in 2021. Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 3.3% decrease from Q4 of 2019 and significantly improved from the sales declines in the second and third quarter. Segment profit of $133 million was up 5% from a year ago, and the profit margin was up 70 basis points to 9.3% compared to 8.6% last year. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both, our North American and Australasian industrial businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so strong operating results for Industrial, which we expect to continue in 2021. So, now, I will turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable to improve our working capital position. In the fourth quarter, we sold $300 million in receivables for a total of $800 million sold in 2020 under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our total accounts receivable is down 36% from 2019, and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31, 2020, was up 2% from the prior year and accounts payable increased 5%, improving our AP to inventory ratio to 118% in 2020 from 114% in 2019. We are pleased with the progress our team is making to strengthen our supply chain. And in 2020, these key accounts were a source of cash from operations, and our total working capital was 7% of revenues. We repaid $230 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and our total debt of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, is down $749 million or 22% from the $3.4 billion in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we further improved our debt position with new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provided for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. We closed the year with $2.9 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Through our efforts in these and other areas, we generated a robust $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020, which is up from $833 million in 2019. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, an increase from $555 million in 2019. While we selectively scaled back our near-term plans for capital deployment in early April of 2020 to conserve cash through COVID-19, we were very committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. We have deployed $4.7 billion in capital across these areas over the last four years. In 2020, we reduced our original $300 million in CapEx plan by 50% and invested $154 million in essential capital expenditures, which was down from $278 million in 2019. For 2021, we expect to resume more normal levels of our reinvestments in our businesses and are planning for total capital expenditures in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the year. We also pulled back on M&A activity in 2020, although strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In 2020, we used $69 million in cash to acquire several small businesses. And in 2021, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement our global Automotive and Industrial segments. As a reminder, we have not considered any of these future acquisitions in our 2021 outlook. The Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.26 per share annual dividend for 2021, representing our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 3% increase from the $3.16 per share paid in 2020. In 2020, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock prior to suspending our share repurchases amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we expect to make additional opportunistic share repurchases again in 2021. Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are reinstating our practice of providing full year guidance. In arriving at our full year 2021 guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 4% to plus 6%. These growth rates assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign currency translation, minimal price inflation and as mentioned before, exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 3% to plus 5% comp sales growth, and a total sales increase of plus 3% to plus 5% for the Industrial segment, including an increase in comp sales of plus 2% to plus 4%. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75. This represents a 5% to 9% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020. We move forward into 2021, confident in our strategic plans and initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and deliver value. In addition, we believe that the underlying industry fundamentals for our global Automotive and Industrial segments are favorable and will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So, that\u2019s our financial update, and we look forward to reporting on further improvement in our financial performance throughout 2021. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. Looking back on the quarter and the year, we are proud of our team for their continued focus on executing our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions. The GPC team and our Automotive and Industrial business proved resilient in meeting the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We closed the year strong with a strong financial performance. We want to thank each of our GPC team members for their continued support, dedication and commitment to serving customers and being the best. We entered 2021 as a stronger, more agile Company, with streamlined operations at a more optimized portfolio focused on the global Automotive and Industrial businesses. We are well positioned with a stronger balance sheet and strategic plan to capture profitable growth, generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value. We are off to a solid start to the year with global automotive sales growth and ongoing industrial recovery and operational improvements. With the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, we look forward to a global recovery from the pandemic and a strengthening economy. For all these reasons, the GPC team is excited about 2021. And we look forward to reporting on our progress as we move through the year. So, thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys. When you look at the NAPA U.S. trends, I guess, it wasn\u2019t quite clear on the commentary. It sounded as if December ended flattish or December ended up. And I think, could you talk a little bit about regional performance as well as NAPA Company-owned stores versus independents in the fourth quarter?\nPaul Donahue: Happy to do so, Bret. And, let me start with the Company store versus our independents. Our Company stores slightly outperformed our independents in the quarter. We\u2019ve seen that already reversed in the other direction in January. That\u2019ll flip month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. So, no real big news there. Regionality, what we saw in the quarter was kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing. We saw really good performance out West. I\u2019m really proud of our Western division and the job that group is doing. Our Mountain team, as they have all year, had a solid quarter. And the Mountain, Bret, just FYI, they stretch from Colorado, Montana, all the way down to Texas. We saw some softness in the Southeast. We saw a little softness in the Northeast as well. In relation to your question about the cadence of the quarter and December specifically, we started out the quarter okay. And I\u2019m assuming that question was around U.S. Automotive, Bret?\nBret Jordan: Yes. That was U.S.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. October started out okay, pretty much in line with September. We saw softness in December, -- and then we saw softness in December as well. I think the first couple of months were probably more related to a little bit warmer weather than -- especially in November, plus we saw a little bit of a COVID resurgence in the U.S. December is a bit unique, Bret. And if you remember, we had a big December a year ago, 2019. We were going up against some pretty tough comps. So, that certainly impacted December as well. But look, here is a good news, Bret, for us and the NAPA team is, we had a really strong rebound in January, both DIY and DIFM, which we\u2019re really pleased to see the commercial business bouncing back in January. And that\u2019s carrying into February as well.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And question is on the supply chain. It sounded as if you were saying maybe there is a couple of categories where stock levels could be better. Is there anything to call out there? I mean, it sounds like batteries have been a great category this winter, but maybe some supply constraints there. I mean, are there any standout categories we should be looking at?\nPaul Donahue: Well, you hit the first one, Bret. We have had -- and we did have a good year in our battery business. And I expect with this cold weather, we\u2019re going to see even a greater surge in our battery business. But supply has been a challenge. And I think you\u2019ve heard that elsewhere. Pleased to say, we\u2019re not seeing that in Europe. We have a strong battery business. We actually just launched the NAPA battery across Europe. We have our suppliers taking good care of us over there. And we\u2019re seeing really good business across Europe in the battery business. But, that would be the call out. There\u2019s a couple of other suppliers that are impacting us. And look, these guys are battling labor shortages due to COVID, some shortages of raw materials. So, I understand they got their challenges, and we\u2019re hoping to see improvement here as we roll into \u201821.\nBret Jordan: And I guess, just a quick follow-up on your Europe comment. It sounded as if you said both the U.S. and Europe had sequentially softened a little bit from the third quarter. But, could you talk a little bit how you saw Europe roll through the fourth quarter and maybe there are trends into January?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So, Europe, they started out really strong. As you know, they had a great third quarter, mid-double-digit increase, Bret. And we had a good October. They were up high single digits in October. We saw a big reversal in November, a double-digit swing from October as Europe locked down due to COVID. So, we saw the third wave come through and that just kind of knocked the wind out of our sales. December bounced back a bit from that softer November. But again, good news, much like North America, we saw a nice rebound in January, and our European team was up strong mid-single-digit. So, we\u2019re encouraged. And we got a lot of good things going on with AAG. I would really, Bret, call out our UK team. They had a really strong year, despite some pretty severe lockdowns during the course of the year. But, again, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our UK team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan.\nChris Horvers: First of all, a follow-up question. So, as you talked about the year-to-date in the U.S., you mentioned, do-it-for-me, the pro business getting better. Did that turn positive so far in January and February?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, absolutely. Yes. We had a double-digit increase in January, and we saw it on both sides of the counter, Chris. We saw it in DIY, as we did most of 2020, our DIY business was strong, like most in the industry. But, where we struggled a bit in \u201820 was in our commercial business. And our commercial business I think is a bit unique compared to most. It\u2019s very, very heavy commercial fleet, government municipalities, but again, really pleased to see that business turn positive in the month of January. And I\u2019m hopeful, Chris, with this -- some of the weather we\u2019re seeing and the reopening of the economies and the vaccines getting out there that -- and along with a little bit of a lift in miles driven, we\u2019ll see some resurgence in our DIFM business.\nChris Horvers: And then, following up there, as you think about the fleet business, how are you thinking about that? Obviously, there\u2019s been some strain on colleges and governments. And are you seeing any sequential improvement in those businesses? Presumably, they remain negative. And, how are you thinking about the outlook in \u201821?\nPaul Donahue: Well, we do think we\u2019ll see improvement overall in that fleet business in \u201821. And January certainly is a good indicator, Chris. Look, there\u2019s a ways to go. By any stretch, we\u2019re not out of the woods in relation to the upheaval caused by COVID. But, we are seeing green shoots, and we are pleased to see a real solid January.\nChris Horvers: Yes, understood. And then, on the Industrial business, if you\u2019re up 2% in January, that\u2019s not stimulus-driven, and you\u2019re guiding, I think, 3% to 5% comps -- or 2% to 4% comps in that business in 2021, and you did it down 8% in 2020. So, is there something that you\u2019re seeing there that provides caution why you wouldn\u2019t expect higher same-store sales in that segment, or is that -- you\u2019re just trying to be conservative given the unknown of COVID?\nPaul Donahue: Well, look, Chris, there is a little certainly a bit of conservatism built into those numbers. We feel really good about the prospects for a strong recovery in our Industrial business in \u201821. We\u2019ve seen now eight straight months of PMI. We generally trail that metric by a few months. So, yes, we feel good. Especially when you look back at 2020, Q2, we were down 17; Q3, down 9; and Q4, down 3 and then post a positive January. But, that conservatism that you kind of referred to, Chris, again, we\u2019re not out of the woods. We\u2019re still seeing some plants shut down just in the last couple of weeks. We do a big business with the OE automotive plants. We\u2019ve seen a number of those shut down to raw material shortages. We\u2019re still pressured in the Southwest with oil and gas. So, yes, we\u2019re -- we feel good, but we\u2019re also seeing still just a few headwinds out there on the Industrial side.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then, last question is, Carol, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin rate in 2021 and as well as SG&A, given you did have a big COVID cost savings number that you\u2019re going to lap against?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, happy to. As far as gross margin, and look, the team, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what we\u2019ve done in the gross margin area. We have, and you saw we finally anniversaried the impact from acquisitions and divestitures. So, our core gross profit in Q4, really pleased to see our initiatives working. We do expect, as we look ahead to have continued improvement in gross profit, may not be at the level that it\u2019s been, but we would expect to see continued gross margin improvement. And, we\u2019ve called out the initiatives in that area before from product mix and strategic category management and even our pricing and global sourcing. And then, I\u2019ll make a few comments on SG&A, and then maybe let Will add and talk about what we\u2019re going to see for 2021. And, you\u2019re right. We did have the temporary cost savings, but more importantly our permanent cost savings of $150 million do roll in to 2021. And we expect to -- while some of those, certainly, the temporary savings come back in. When you look at our outlook for 2021 on SG&A, we have improvement when you go back to say the 2019 levels. So, we really have permanently reduced our cost structure, if you will. But having said that, there\u2019s still things we\u2019re working on that. We\u2019re going to see headwinds in terms of payroll and freight. And I\u2019ll maybe let Will talk about a few things we\u2019re doing to maybe offset some of those headwinds.\nWill Stengel: Yes, Chris. So, maybe just back on gross margin. I mean, gross margin is going to continue to be a focus for us as we move forward. I think, in the prepared remarks, we did a nice job of laying out kind of some of the details in terms of what that means. But category management around pricing, global sourcing, et cetera, will be important priorities for us as we move forward. On the SG&A, there is really kind of two ways to think about it. First is, the importance, as Carol alluded to, of keeping these temporary cost savings out. So, converting them from temporary to permanent, and that\u2019s a daily activity that we work on with the teams here. But then, obviously, very discrete productivity initiatives around the globe around SG&A, ranging from labor productivity in DCs, evaluating and analyzing indirect spend, low-cost country opportunities for back-office functions, et cetera. So, we\u2019ve got a laundry list of very tactical actions. And we\u2019re excited about the momentum that we\u2019ve got.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore.\nMichael Montani: I also just wanted to offer congratulations to Will on the promotion.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Mike.\nMichael Montani: So, if I could start off -- just was on the SG&A front first off. Is there a way to think about the potential dollar growth year-over-year and/or the kind of organic comps that we would need to see to get natural leverage there? Carol and Will, I think, historically, kind of 2% to 3% was the number organic growth, but if you could give us an update there?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Look, we have -- and as you have seen, we are guiding to organic growth at -- in the 3% to 5% range. We certainly expect to have margin improvement with that organic growth. And again, we\u2019re looking at getting ourselves back to certainly to a sales level at where 2019 was but a profit and operating margin level that\u2019s greater than that. So, I think, it\u2019s at the low end of the 3% that we can have margin improvement. And I certainly think that you\u2019ll see that with some of the initiatives we talked about.\nMichael Montani: Okay, great. And, if I could, just on the NAPA front, just wanted to parse out, in the fourth quarter, if there\u2019s any extra color you can share, Paul, on DIY versus DIFM comps? And then, if you could help us just to understand the traffic and ticket split for the comp.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me take the latter part of that question first. As we look at ticket comps and we look across the globe, I\u2019m really pleased with the trends we\u2019re seeing in Australia -- our Asia Pac business was up strong in both average ticket size and traffic. Canada, we were up both average ticket size and traffic. U.S., our average ticket was up, which has been a trend we\u2019ve seen for a number of quarters now. Traffic was down a bit in the U.S., again, not a surprise because we saw a real surge in our digital online, deliver-to-store, pick up at curbside. So, folks are still a little bit reticent I think to walk into stores. And then, the other question, Mike, you asked was around DIY, DIFM in the quarter, in Q4. What we saw was much like we had seen throughout the year with -- or the latter part of the year, I should say, with DIY held up strong and DIFM was certainly pressured in the quarter. But again, as I think I mentioned earlier in a question, really pleased to see both trending up in January. So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019re going to see our DIFM return to solid growth in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nBeth Reed: Hey, guys. This is Beth Reed on for Scot. I just had a question on the acceleration in the U.S. auto business that you\u2019re seeing into January and February. Is there any way to kind of quantify the impact of stimulus on that acceleration? And any other factors you would call out that you think are the main drivers?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Beth. Look, stimulus monies are definitely impacting the DIY business, I think, not only for us, but our peer group. But, we are a dominant DIFM business. That\u2019s 80-plus-percent of our business at. So, I don\u2019t really believe we see much impact, if any, stimulus on our DIFM business. Yes, I think, if I were to point to perhaps some of the lift that we\u2019re seeing early in the year. Look, the weather is a factor. There is just no two ways about it. And, we\u2019re seeing a return to a more normalized winter that we haven\u2019t seen in a few years. What\u2019s unfortunate, Beth, and we don\u2019t want to take this lightly. There are lots of folks out there in the Texas region that are without power. They\u2019ve been without power for a couple of days. So, we don\u2019t mind seeing winter. I just wish it wasn\u2019t quite as extreme and the impact that it\u2019s having. We\u2019ve got a number of distribution centers, branches, stores that are closed throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. So, it\u2019s definitely taken a toll here this week. We\u2019ll see the long-term impact of a really cold weather, and it will show up months down the road when parts begin to fail as a result of some of this really brutally cold winter.\nBeth Reed: All right. Got it. And then, just a quick clarification. Did you say January trends have largely kind of continued into February?\nPaul Donahue: Well, they certainly did. But, what we\u2019re seeing right now is with the number of DC closures were across Texas and the other states I just mentioned, along with many of our Industrial branches. I think the number I saw yesterday, Beth, we had about 90 of our Industrial branches were closed. So, it\u2019s going to have a little bit of an impact probably for a couple of days. But, again, we\u2019ll recover. And I expect that will have a positive impact longer-term on our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And yes, I\u2019ll pass my congrats on to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Dan.\nDaniel Imbro: Carol, I wanted to start -- and apologies if I missed this, trying to screw away the cost cutting last year with maybe some of the organic growth slowing. You targeted $100 million. Obviously, you exceeded that meaningfully. I think, you said $150 million in permanent cost cuts. As you look back with hindsight, is it possible, in some places, you may have cut too deep, and that\u2019s part of the reason for the organic growth slowdown? And then, if not, can you maybe share some detail on where you did remove the cost, so we can better understand why that isn\u2019t impacting service levels?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Look, we -- as you look at our cost savings, and again, this was done early on in response to the very-drastic declines in volume that we saw from Europe starting at the end of Q1 to North America and other geographies. We had -- Q2 was one of our worst quarters ever in the Company\u2019s history. And with that, there was actions that needed to be taken. And as related to reducing payroll, reducing positions, we had furloughs, we had deferred travel and entertainment, we looked at facility and lease reductions, we looked at our facility costs, we looked at -- I mean, we looked at anything and everything. And it was -- again, we did that without impacting our service, but we did it to adjust to the lower volumes. And then, as volumes have come back, we looked at those costs. Again, some of those costs had to come back in. During this time, we also didn\u2019t let up on our investments in productivity and automation. So, we had a number of automation projects that we continue to work on that would help us with productivity improvements, where we rationalize facilities and put in more automated conveyor systems. That helped us as well. So, again, we -- the permanent savings go back to a year ago. Those were largely payroll related, the $150 million. Again, we were very comfortable to how those were done. The temporary ones were just that. They were temporary in nature. And remember, part of that temporary was government subsidies. So, again, we had about $60 million in government subsidies that are nonrecurring. The fact of the matter is we go into 2021 with a lower overall cost base and excitement about the initiatives we have in place to keep our cost structure down.\nPaul Donahue: Hey Daniel, I\u2019ll just add a comment to that as well because it\u2019s been mentioned before, and I touched on it in my prepared remarks. But just to call out, in our NAPA business here across the U.S., we have over 3,000 sales professionals between our Company stores and our independent stores that are working with our shops and professional garages every day. So, the thought of did we cut too deep, we don\u2019t believe so. And again, I think, what we saw were some transitory challenges in \u201820 that are going to bounce back in \u201821.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys for that. And then, I wanted to ask a clarifier on the comp growth you said earlier, Carol. I think, you said within Auto, 3% to 5% comps with 4 to 6 total revs, and then Industrial is 2 to 4 with total revs in 3 to 5. Most of those would imply roughly only 100 basis points of FX headwind. I guess, can you help me understand how they have a similar amount of headwinds between the segments when Automotive has a much larger European footprint? So, I would think, FX is more of a tailwind to the Auto business. So, trying to reconcile, yes, the magnitude of FX impact. Thanks.\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Just to be clear, the same-store sales guidance that we gave in relation to the total sales is more of the impact of the carryover of acquisitions from 2020. So, we had a number of bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive space and then we also had three Industrial acquisitions late in 2020. So, the 1% differential is the carryover of M&A. Our implication for foreign currency is really neutral. And we also have inflation neutral in these numbers. As Paul mentioned, we expect we will see some inflation at some point. But, this is truly just what we know today as far as organic growth, plus a little bit of carryover from acquisitions that\u2019s in that guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research.\nDavid Bellinger: I want to follow-up on January, but a bit of a different context. So, a few of your auto parts competitors have indicated comparable sales accelerating into the double digits, maybe since its January. It seems as though NAPA comp sales are up high single digits at this point. So, is there anything that\u2019s changed versus your peers from the last few quarters? Is there something strategic on your part that helps them to narrow the gap versus competitors, or is it really the mix of business that\u2019s driving that better delta now?\nPaul Donahue: Well, look David, it\u2019s a reasonable question. We\u2019ve been working on a number of initiatives throughout the course of 2020 that I would tell you I think are really beginning to take hold. We are not nearly as weighted towards the DIY side. So, even though we\u2019re seeing some nice lift in DIY, it\u2019s not going to move the needle for us like DIFM. So, what I would point to and how we\u2019re narrowing that gap is the slight recovery we\u2019re seeing from COVID, markets opening back up, I think, we\u2019re going to see miles driven tick back up. We haven\u2019t seen any official numbers out of December, January yet. But that coupled with some winter weather is all going to help spike our DIFM business. And again, we\u2019re really, really pleased to see that spike in the month of January.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up here, how are you thinking about the pace of parts inflation throughout 2021? You mentioned a limited benefit last year, maybe a low single-digit rate coming this year. Are you getting ahead of that now and flowing some price to both DIY and commercial, given strengthening demand? And, do you expect to fully offset any cost increases through price this year?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Look, we are getting early indication from our suppliers. I mean, look, our suppliers, as Paul mentioned, they\u2019re facing raw material increases, freight and ocean cargo and just the significant increases that our suppliers are facing, labor shortages, labor inflation. We are hearing that our suppliers are discussing price increases, we believe, certainly in Automotive, it\u2019s been very rational. And as these price increases come that they will get passed through. Also on the Industrial side, our teams are trying to stay ahead of that and doing a lot of things to make sure that those can -- when they do get the pricing, they can pass them along. I would tell you that will probably be more second half weighted. Again, some of this is managing through the uncertainty right now, but probably more second half weighted. So, the 1% to 2%, 1% to 3%, if you will, is on a full year basis, but probably more second half. But again, that\u2019s not in any of our numbers. And the last thing I would just add, and you heard Will talk about it, our teams have so many terrific initiatives going on in the gross margin area, especially in terms of pricing. So, we\u2019re a lot more agile today. We have a lot more analytics and a lot more strategic pricing initiatives that will help us offset this as well.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in our year-end and Q4 conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to reporting out to you on our first quarter results in April. Thank you. And have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to say that I'm incredibly proud to be a part of Genuine Parts Company. The Company has an impressive history of success, and it's an honor to be on the GPC leadership team. I'd like to thank Paul and the Board for their vote of confidence. As Paul mentioned, I joined the Company in late 2019 as Chief Transformation Officer. Previously, I held executive leadership positions at HD Supply, including time as President and CEO of HD Supply Facilities Maintenance, and various other strategy and operating roles. My experience in distribution-related businesses fits well with GPC's portfolio, business model and strategic initiatives, where consistent profitable growth, operating leverage, strong cash conversion, and disciplined capital allocation are all key value drivers, with the dividend an especially important part of the GPC capital allocation strategy. I'm excited about the future potential of Genuine Parts Company. Each of our GPC businesses enjoy leadership positions within attractive fragmented markets with scale and capabilities to win. We have leading global brands and longstanding relationships, based on reliable customer service and value-added expertise. And our unique culture that is based on a clear set of core values and purpose serves as an important common foundation. Strategic actions taken in 2020 accelerated the transformation momentum built over recent years as we work to simplify the business and further define our critical focus areas. The global teams executed well as we navigated the pandemic and demonstrated an ability to act quickly and deliver results. Our strategic actions provided clarity for areas where we want to increase our focus, including profitable organic growth, driving operating productivity through simplification and integration, disciplined and strategic capital deployment and investments in talent to develop and build capabilities. Despite a challenging and unprecedented year, our diverse businesses proved resilient and built solid momentum as we enter 2021. In my new role, I look forward to working with Paul and the global leadership team as we align resources within our focus areas to execute these initiatives and deliver value as a team. I'm also looking forward to spending time in our operations and with our customers and suppliers. In addition, we'll continue to further refine and advance our longer term strategic roadmap. We're excited about the numerous potential opportunities that new technologies and emerging trends could present for GPC. As we look to the future, we feel well-positioned to execute our strategic priorities to the benefit of all our stakeholders, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to drive results. Thank you. And I'll now turn it to Carol for her comments. Yes, Chris. So, maybe just back on gross margin. I mean, gross margin is going to continue to be a focus for us as we move forward. I think, in the prepared remarks, we did a nice job of laying out kind of some of the details in terms of what that means. But category management around pricing, global sourcing, et cetera, will be important priorities for us as we move forward. On the SG&A, there is really kind of two ways to think about it.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you, Will. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income. We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 0.7% from 2019. For the full year, sales were $16.5 billion, down 5.6% or down 2.3%, excluding divestitures. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 35%, a 40 basis-point improvement compared to 34.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin improved 100 basis points to 34.5% from 33.5% in 2019. Our team has been focused on a number of margin-enhancing initiatives, and the fourth quarter and full year gains represent the 13th consecutive quarter and the 5th consecutive year of improved gross margin for the Company. Our steady progress in expanding gross margin in the quarter and the year reflect a variety of factors, including the favorable impact of sales mix shifts to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and strategic category management initiatives. In addition, the full year gross margin also benefited from acquisitions and divestitures, which impacted our results through the nine months. We would add these positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. And finally, as we assess the pricing environment in the fourth quarter and 2020 overall, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our sales and gross margins. As Paul mentioned earlier, we'll see how this plays out in 2021, but we have not had any impact of inflation to this point in the year. Our adjusted selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 2.8% from last year and representing 26.6% of sales compared to 27.2% last year. For the year, these expenses were $4.4 billion, down 3.9% compared to last year and 26.5% of sales compared to 26% in 2019. The decrease in operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the favorable impact of our permanent and COVID-related cost actions implemented throughout 2020, as previously discussed. As mentioned on our third quarter conference call, in accordance with our 2019 $100 million cost savings plan, we successfully achieved the $100 million annual target ahead of schedule. We are pleased to report an incremental $40 million in savings recognized in the fourth quarter and $150 million in permanent expense reductions for 2020. In addition, our team continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to the impact of COVID-19. These initiatives contributed temporary cost savings of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year. Combined, we generated approximately $80 million in total savings during the fourth quarter and approximately $450 million for the full year, driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility costs, as well as temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, government subsidies and other initiatives in response to COVID. We expect our permanent cost savings to carry over into 2021, and we'll continue to manage our expenses to further improve our cost structure and operating performance. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3.4% from last year. This represents 28.1% of sales, down 80 basis points from 28.9% in 2019. For the full year, these expenses were an adjusted $4.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year and representing 28.4% of sales. Our total segment profit in the fourth quarter was $374 million, up 14% on a 1% sales decrease, and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 7.7% last year for a strong increase of 110 basis points. For the full year, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up 3% compared to 2019, and our segment profit margin was 8.2% compared to 7.8% in the prior year. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2015. We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter, and for 2020, net interest was $91 million, which is essentially flat from 2019. In 2021, we expect net interest of $70 million to $72 million, which is down from 2020 due to lower interest rates related to our new debt agreements negotiated in the fourth quarter, as well as the expectation for lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $33 million in the fourth quarter, down from $37 million in 2019, and for the year, these expenses were $150 million. We currently expect our corporate expense to be in the $150 million range again in 2021. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1%, an increase from 24.6% in the prior year period. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5% and in line with 2019. We are planning for a full year tax rate for 2021 in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $172 million with earnings per share of $1.18. Adjusted net income was $221 million or $1.52 per share, which compares to $186 million or $1.27 per share in 2019 or a 20% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $163 million or $1.13 per share, and adjusted net income was $765 million or $5.27 per share. So, now, let's discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Segment profit of $240 million was up 19%, with profit margin at 8.5% compared to a 7.2% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 130 basis-point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our Automotive businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so an excellent job of operating by our Automotive team, and we look forward to continued progress in 2021. Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 3.3% decrease from Q4 of 2019 and significantly improved from the sales declines in the second and third quarter. Segment profit of $133 million was up 5% from a year ago, and the profit margin was up 70 basis points to 9.3% compared to 8.6% last year. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both, our North American and Australasian industrial businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so strong operating results for Industrial, which we expect to continue in 2021. So, now, I will turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to closely manage our accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable to improve our working capital position. In the fourth quarter, we sold $300 million in receivables for a total of $800 million sold in 2020 under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our total accounts receivable is down 36% from 2019, and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31, 2020, was up 2% from the prior year and accounts payable increased 5%, improving our AP to inventory ratio to 118% in 2020 from 114% in 2019. We are pleased with the progress our team is making to strengthen our supply chain. And in 2020, these key accounts were a source of cash from operations, and our total working capital was 7% of revenues. We repaid $230 million of debt in the fourth quarter, and our total debt of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, is down $749 million or 22% from the $3.4 billion in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we further improved our debt position with new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provided for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. We closed the year with $2.9 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Through our efforts in these and other areas, we generated a robust $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020, which is up from $833 million in 2019. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, an increase from $555 million in 2019. While we selectively scaled back our near-term plans for capital deployment in early April of 2020 to conserve cash through COVID-19, we were very committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. We have deployed $4.7 billion in capital across these areas over the last four years. In 2020, we reduced our original $300 million in CapEx plan by 50% and invested $154 million in essential capital expenditures, which was down from $278 million in 2019. For 2021, we expect to resume more normal levels of our reinvestments in our businesses and are planning for total capital expenditures in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the year. We also pulled back on M&A activity in 2020, although strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In 2020, we used $69 million in cash to acquire several small businesses. And in 2021, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement our global Automotive and Industrial segments. As a reminder, we have not considered any of these future acquisitions in our 2021 outlook. The Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.26 per share annual dividend for 2021, representing our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 3% increase from the $3.16 per share paid in 2020. In 2020, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock prior to suspending our share repurchases amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we expect to make additional opportunistic share repurchases again in 2021. Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are reinstating our practice of providing full year guidance. In arriving at our full year 2021 guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 4% to plus 6%. These growth rates assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign currency translation, minimal price inflation and as mentioned before, exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 3% to plus 5% comp sales growth, and a total sales increase of plus 3% to plus 5% for the Industrial segment, including an increase in comp sales of plus 2% to plus 4%. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75. This represents a 5% to 9% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020. We move forward into 2021, confident in our strategic plans and initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and deliver value. In addition, we believe that the underlying industry fundamentals for our global Automotive and Industrial segments are favorable and will continue to provide us with sustained long-term growth opportunities. So, that's our financial update, and we look forward to reporting on further improvement in our financial performance throughout 2021. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Yes, happy to. As far as gross margin, and look, the team, we couldn't be more pleased with what we've done in the gross margin area. We have, and you saw we finally anniversaried the impact from acquisitions and divestitures. So, our core gross profit in Q4, really pleased to see our initiatives working. We do expect, as we look ahead to have continued improvement in gross profit, may not be at the level that it's been, but we would expect to see continued gross margin improvement. And, we've called out the initiatives in that area before from product mix and strategic category management and even our pricing and global sourcing. And then, I'll make a few comments on SG&A, and then maybe let Will add and talk about what we're going to see for 2021. And, you're right. We did have the temporary cost savings, but more importantly our permanent cost savings of $150 million do roll in to 2021. And we expect to -- while some of those, certainly, the temporary savings come back in. When you look at our outlook for 2021 on SG&A, we have improvement when you go back to say the 2019 levels. So, we really have permanently reduced our cost structure, if you will. But having said that, there's still things we're working on that. We're going to see headwinds in terms of payroll and freight. And I'll maybe let Will talk about a few things we're doing to maybe offset some of those headwinds. Yes. Look, we have -- and as you have seen, we are guiding to organic growth at -- in the 3% to 5% range. We certainly expect to have margin improvement with that organic growth. And again, we're looking at getting ourselves back to certainly to a sales level at where 2019 was but a profit and operating margin level that's greater than that. So, I think, it's at the low end of the 3% that we can have margin improvement. And I certainly think that you'll see that with some of the initiatives we talked about. Yes. Look, we -- as you look at our cost savings, and again, this was done early on in response to the very-drastic declines in volume that we saw from Europe starting at the end of Q1 to North America and other geographies. We had -- Q2 was one of our worst quarters ever in the Company's history. And with that, there was actions that needed to be taken. And as related to reducing payroll, reducing positions, we had furloughs, we had deferred travel and entertainment, we looked at facility and lease reductions, we looked at our facility costs, we looked at -- I mean, we looked at anything and everything. And it was -- again, we did that without impacting our service, but we did it to adjust to the lower volumes. And then, as volumes have come back, we looked at those costs. Again, some of those costs had to come back in. During this time, we also didn't let up on our investments in productivity and automation. So, we had a number of automation projects that we continue to work on that would help us with productivity improvements, where we rationalize facilities and put in more automated conveyor systems. That helped us as well. So, again, we -- the permanent savings go back to a year ago. Those were largely payroll related, the $150 million. Again, we were very comfortable to how those were done. The temporary ones were just that. They were temporary in nature. And remember, part of that temporary was government subsidies. So, again, we had about $60 million in government subsidies that are nonrecurring. The fact of the matter is we go into 2021 with a lower overall cost base and excitement about the initiatives we have in place to keep our cost structure down. Yes. Just to be clear, the same-store sales guidance that we gave in relation to the total sales is more of the impact of the carryover of acquisitions from 2020. So, we had a number of bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive space and then we also had three Industrial acquisitions late in 2020. So, the 1% differential is the carryover of M&A. Our implication for foreign currency is really neutral. And we also have inflation neutral in these numbers. As Paul mentioned, we expect we will see some inflation at some point. But, this is truly just what we know today as far as organic growth, plus a little bit of carryover from acquisitions that's in that guidance. Yes. Look, we are getting early indication from our suppliers. I mean, look, our suppliers, as Paul mentioned, they're facing raw material increases, freight and ocean cargo and just the significant increases that our suppliers are facing, labor shortages, labor inflation. We are hearing that our suppliers are discussing price increases, we believe, certainly in Automotive, it's been very rational. And as these price increases come that they will get passed through. Also on the Industrial side, our teams are trying to stay ahead of that and doing a lot of things to make sure that those can -- when they do get the pricing, they can pass them along. I would tell you that will probably be more second half weighted. Again, some of this is managing through the uncertainty right now, but probably more second half weighted. So, the 1% to 2%, 1% to 3%, if you will, is on a full year basis, but probably more second half. But again, that's not in any of our numbers. And the last thing I would just add, and you heard Will talk about it, our teams have so many terrific initiatives going on in the gross margin area, especially in terms of pricing. So, we're a lot more agile today. We have a lot more analytics and a lot more strategic pricing initiatives that will help us offset this as well. We'd like to thank you for your participation in our year-end and Q4 conference call. As always, we appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to reporting out to you on our first quarter results in April. Thank you. And have a great day."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are all staying safe and well. Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategic actions, despite the continued challenges of COVID-19. The GPC team was agile and adapting to dynamic conditions and executed on our initiatives to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results. We are grateful to our 50,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to excellence, while responding to unprecedented business and economic conditions, which have continued for nearly 12 months. Our operational focus is on ensuring a safe work environment, supporting our talented workforce and further strengthening our strong culture. In January, we're pleased to promote Will Stengel to President, and we now welcome Will to this quarterly call. As our Chief Transformation Officer since 2019, Will helped our business units work to achieve a variety of strategic initiatives and significant cost savings in 2020. Will's vast skill set and relevant experience in his previous career with HD Supply, have added tremendous value to our management team. His exceptional talent, proven leadership and experience make Will an excellent choice as our Company's next President. And we look forward to his future contributions. You will hear from both Will and Carol later in the call, and then we'll take your questions. So, now, turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, down 1% due in part to the continued challenges of COVID-19. While our Automotive sales were strong in Asia Pac, the pace of recovery slowed in Europe and North America relative to the previous quarter. Industrial sales grew progressively stronger during the final three months of 2020 and were much improved from the prior two quarters. We further improved gross margin, and in fact, the fourth quarter was our 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. In addition, we successfully took action to reduce costs, lowering our year-over-year operating expenses. For the quarter, we generated an additional $40 million in permanent cost savings and realized another $40 million in temporary savings related to our response to COVID-19. Our progress in these areas drove a 14% increase in total operating profit and an 8.8% operating margin. This 110 basis-point improvement in operating margin from the fourth quarter of 2019 was supported by margin expansion in both, the Automotive and Industrial segments. Our strong operating performance drove adjusted net income of $221 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52, up 20%. Due to ongoing working capital and debt financing initiatives, we also finished the quarter and year with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and robust cash flow with $2 billion in cash from operations in 2020. Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the fourth quarter and Industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. Total sales for the global Automotive Group were $2.8 billion, a 1% increase from 2019, with comp sales down 2%. Segment profit margin was up 130 basis points, driven by improvement in each of our Automotive operations. Fourth quarter sales were led by strong growth in Asia Pac with continued retail and commercial sales momentum driving a second consecutive quarter of mid-teens sales. The Asia Pac team performed well all year and deserves a special shout out on their exceptional results. So, congratulations and a big thank you to Rob Cameron and the entire Automotive team down under. In Europe and North America, the surge in COVID cases led to more restrictions on mobility, and mild weather through most of the quarter pressured sales of seasonal items. A second lockdown in November significantly slowed sales activity across Europe, although sales gradually improved through December, driving flat comps for the quarter. We would add as well that despite the challenging conditions in Europe overall, our UK operations continued to outperform with solid results for the quarter. Additionally, the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives more than offset the sales pressure, and the European team produced a 100 basis-point operating margin improvement. This caps a strong recovery in Europe's operating performance over the second half of 2020. In North America, our U.S. Automotive total sales and comp sales declined approximately 6%. Despite the sales decrease, the U.S. team generated a 200 basis-point improvement in operating profit margin. In Canada, quarterly sales were down slightly, comp sales declined 2%, and operating margin improved by 40 basis points. Growth in sales for our retail customers continued to outperform expectations, while sales to the DIFM segment remained challenging. Through the quarter, DIY sales were strong, driven by COVID-related shifts in consumer behavior and stimulus payments, and stronger NAPA sales positioning, resulting from several key initiatives. These include our ongoing store refreshes, investment in retail specialists, the benefit of our NAPA rewards program with 12.5 million active members, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising initiatives. In addition, our growing omni-channel capabilities, including direct-to-customers shipping from select suppliers enabled our team to double our online sales volume from pre-pandemic levels. DIFM sales were down from 2019 as a slow recovery in miles driven, mild temperatures and continued pressure in our large fleet and government customers segment weighed on sales demand. To address these declines and build positive momentum in 2021, our team has focused on several initiatives, including maximizing sales force effectiveness by repurposing our field resources and doubling the number of professional salespeople calling directly on our end customers to professional repair garages, continued enhancement of our industry-leading commercial programs and promotions for the professional customers, including NAPA AutoCare and Auto Pro, improving our inventory availability, utilizing enhanced analytics to ensure more parts for more cars across our store network, strengthening in our supply chain, focusing on our global supplier relationships, as well as ensuring we have multiple suppliers by category. While we are seeing gradual improvement with supply chain service issues, there is more work yet to be done, and finally, further optimizing our network, including DC consolidation, increasing automation in our facilities and additional daily shuttles. In 2021, we will also continue to execute on several global initiatives and invest in our omni-channel strategy, both B2B and B2C to enhance and build new digital catalog and search capabilities, implement strategic pricing initiatives, focus on value added services, and continue our rollout of the NAPA brand in Europe and Australasia. We also have plans to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers, and new greenfield stores to enhance our competitive positioning across our automotive operation. These initiatives are designed to deliver customer value, sell more parts, and capture market share. To that end, we are pleased to report a strong start in 2021 with January average daily sales up low double digits in the U.S. and for our global Automotive Group. Backing out the positive impact of FX and acquisition revenues, comp sales were up high single digits in January. We would add that we continue to see little impact of price inflation in our sales, although we expect to see more supplier increases in the coming months and quarters, possibly in the 1 to 3% range for the full year. So, in summary, we believe improving product availability, colder winter weather in North America and Europe, and the gradual reopening of the economy are current tailwinds for automotive business. In addition, favorable industry fundamentals, a growing total vehicle fleet, an increase in vehicles aged 6 to 12 years and expectation for the gradual recovery in miles driven give us confidence in our growth expectations for 2021, despite the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19. So, now, let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group are $1.4 billion, down 3.3% from last year. Comp sales were down 4.4%, a significant improvement from the 9% decrease in Q3 and the 17% decrease we saw back in Q2. The steady recovery in sales over the last half of 2020 is consistent with the gradual improvement in the industrial economy, which is evident in indicators such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production. Strengthening conditions combined with our ongoing initiatives to drive growth and lower costs resulted in a 70 basis-point improvement in the segment profit margin and our strongest quarterly return on sales since the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales in North America and Australasia showed similar sales trends for the fourth quarter overall, although December was the strongest month in the quarter in North America. In addition, most key product categories achieved positive sales growth in December with improved month-to-month sales trends among virtually all the industries that we serve. We expect to build on these favorable trends in 2021. As we move forward into 2021, which is Motion's 75th year in business, the Industrial team will continue to execute on strategic initiatives to drive profitable sales growth, improve operational productivity and deliver customer value. These initiatives include building out our omnichannel capabilities to drive organic sales; optimize the value of the Motion website and accelerate e-commerce growth; growing our services and solutions business to expand our expertise in areas such as repair, conveyance and automation; ongoing disciplined M&A to further boost our products and service offering, while expanding our global footprint and market presence; enhancing our global pricing and product category management strategies to ensure sales excellence, margin effectiveness and a product offering that evolves the Motion brand globally; and optimizing our global distribution network, the enhanced automation and facility rationalization to lower cost, improve productivity and deliver excellent customer service. We are confident that our focus on these key initiatives will optimize our competitive positioning as the industrial markets recover to full capacity. We are encouraged to see releases of capital project orders that were on hold throughout most of 2020, which is a positive sign for our greater plant activity in the months and quarters ahead. In addition, we are pleased that our supplier service levels are strong, despite extended lead times on select items, and our inventories are in good position to meet expected growing demand. Finally, we currently expect another year of reasonable 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers, which compares to inflation of just under 1% in 2020. For additional perspective, we experienced positive sales momentum in January, with average daily sales up 2% for the month. This is better than the sales trends we reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and is a testament to the great work done by the entire Industrial team. So, despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its uncertain impact on the global economy and our markets, we are confident in our plans for the Industrial segment and look forward to a strong 2021. So, let me conclude by providing an update on our ESG initiatives. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to innovate in ways that also benefit our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. Our ESG practices, including human capital management, and diversity and inclusion are discussed in our 2020 corporate sustainability report. In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a formal human rights policy, which communicates the Company's commitment to upholding human rights in every location in which we operate as well as our expectation that our suppliers, partners and affiliates also respect human rights. Our Companywide commitment to sustainability is integral to our corporate growth strategy. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view these documents and learn more about our ESG initiatives. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will? Thank you, Carol. Looking back on the quarter and the year, we are proud of our team for their continued focus on executing our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions. The GPC team and our Automotive and Industrial business proved resilient in meeting the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We closed the year strong with a strong financial performance. We want to thank each of our GPC team members for their continued support, dedication and commitment to serving customers and being the best. We entered 2021 as a stronger, more agile Company, with streamlined operations at a more optimized portfolio focused on the global Automotive and Industrial businesses. We are well positioned with a stronger balance sheet and strategic plan to capture profitable growth, generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value. We are off to a solid start to the year with global automotive sales growth and ongoing industrial recovery and operational improvements. With the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, we look forward to a global recovery from the pandemic and a strengthening economy. For all these reasons, the GPC team is excited about 2021. And we look forward to reporting on our progress as we move through the year. So, thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Happy to do so, Bret. And, let me start with the Company store versus our independents. Our Company stores slightly outperformed our independents in the quarter. We've seen that already reversed in the other direction in January. That'll flip month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. So, no real big news there. Regionality, what we saw in the quarter was kind of consistent with what we've been seeing. We saw really good performance out West. I'm really proud of our Western division and the job that group is doing. Our Mountain team, as they have all year, had a solid quarter. And the Mountain, Bret, just FYI, they stretch from Colorado, Montana, all the way down to Texas. We saw some softness in the Southeast. We saw a little softness in the Northeast as well. In relation to your question about the cadence of the quarter and December specifically, we started out the quarter okay. And I'm assuming that question was around U.S. Automotive, Bret? Yes. October started out okay, pretty much in line with September. We saw softness in December, -- and then we saw softness in December as well. I think the first couple of months were probably more related to a little bit warmer weather than -- especially in November, plus we saw a little bit of a COVID resurgence in the U.S. December is a bit unique, Bret. And if you remember, we had a big December a year ago, 2019. We were going up against some pretty tough comps. So, that certainly impacted December as well. But look, here is a good news, Bret, for us and the NAPA team is, we had a really strong rebound in January, both DIY and DIFM, which we're really pleased to see the commercial business bouncing back in January. And that's carrying into February as well. Well, you hit the first one, Bret. We have had -- and we did have a good year in our battery business. And I expect with this cold weather, we're going to see even a greater surge in our battery business. But supply has been a challenge. And I think you've heard that elsewhere. Pleased to say, we're not seeing that in Europe. We have a strong battery business. We actually just launched the NAPA battery across Europe. We have our suppliers taking good care of us over there. And we're seeing really good business across Europe in the battery business. But, that would be the call out. There's a couple of other suppliers that are impacting us. And look, these guys are battling labor shortages due to COVID, some shortages of raw materials. So, I understand they got their challenges, and we're hoping to see improvement here as we roll into \u201821. Yes. So, Europe, they started out really strong. As you know, they had a great third quarter, mid-double-digit increase, Bret. And we had a good October. They were up high single digits in October. We saw a big reversal in November, a double-digit swing from October as Europe locked down due to COVID. So, we saw the third wave come through and that just kind of knocked the wind out of our sales. December bounced back a bit from that softer November. But again, good news, much like North America, we saw a nice rebound in January, and our European team was up strong mid-single-digit. So, we're encouraged. And we got a lot of good things going on with AAG. I would really, Bret, call out our UK team. They had a really strong year, despite some pretty severe lockdowns during the course of the year. But, again, I couldn't be more proud of our UK team. Yes, absolutely. Yes. We had a double-digit increase in January, and we saw it on both sides of the counter, Chris. We saw it in DIY, as we did most of 2020, our DIY business was strong, like most in the industry. But, where we struggled a bit in \u201820 was in our commercial business. And our commercial business I think is a bit unique compared to most. It's very, very heavy commercial fleet, government municipalities, but again, really pleased to see that business turn positive in the month of January. And I'm hopeful, Chris, with this -- some of the weather we're seeing and the reopening of the economies and the vaccines getting out there that -- and along with a little bit of a lift in miles driven, we'll see some resurgence in our DIFM business. Well, we do think we'll see improvement overall in that fleet business in \u201821. And January certainly is a good indicator, Chris. Look, there's a ways to go. By any stretch, we're not out of the woods in relation to the upheaval caused by COVID. But, we are seeing green shoots, and we are pleased to see a real solid January. Well, look, Chris, there is a little certainly a bit of conservatism built into those numbers. We feel really good about the prospects for a strong recovery in our Industrial business in \u201821. We've seen now eight straight months of PMI. We generally trail that metric by a few months. So, yes, we feel good. Especially when you look back at 2020, Q2, we were down 17; Q3, down 9; and Q4, down 3 and then post a positive January. But, that conservatism that you kind of referred to, Chris, again, we're not out of the woods. We're still seeing some plants shut down just in the last couple of weeks. We do a big business with the OE automotive plants. We've seen a number of those shut down to raw material shortages. We're still pressured in the Southwest with oil and gas. So, yes, we're -- we feel good, but we're also seeing still just a few headwinds out there on the Industrial side. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me take the latter part of that question first. As we look at ticket comps and we look across the globe, I'm really pleased with the trends we're seeing in Australia -- our Asia Pac business was up strong in both average ticket size and traffic. Canada, we were up both average ticket size and traffic. U.S., our average ticket was up, which has been a trend we've seen for a number of quarters now. Traffic was down a bit in the U.S., again, not a surprise because we saw a real surge in our digital online, deliver-to-store, pick up at curbside. So, folks are still a little bit reticent I think to walk into stores. And then, the other question, Mike, you asked was around DIY, DIFM in the quarter, in Q4. What we saw was much like we had seen throughout the year with -- or the latter part of the year, I should say, with DIY held up strong and DIFM was certainly pressured in the quarter. But again, as I think I mentioned earlier in a question, really pleased to see both trending up in January. So, we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to see our DIFM return to solid growth in 2021. Yes. Thanks, Beth. Look, stimulus monies are definitely impacting the DIY business, I think, not only for us, but our peer group. But, we are a dominant DIFM business. That's 80-plus-percent of our business at. So, I don't really believe we see much impact, if any, stimulus on our DIFM business. Yes, I think, if I were to point to perhaps some of the lift that we're seeing early in the year. Look, the weather is a factor. There is just no two ways about it. And, we're seeing a return to a more normalized winter that we haven't seen in a few years. What's unfortunate, Beth, and we don't want to take this lightly. There are lots of folks out there in the Texas region that are without power. They've been without power for a couple of days. So, we don't mind seeing winter. I just wish it wasn't quite as extreme and the impact that it's having. We've got a number of distribution centers, branches, stores that are closed throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. So, it's definitely taken a toll here this week. We'll see the long-term impact of a really cold weather, and it will show up months down the road when parts begin to fail as a result of some of this really brutally cold winter. Well, they certainly did. But, what we're seeing right now is with the number of DC closures were across Texas and the other states I just mentioned, along with many of our Industrial branches. I think the number I saw yesterday, Beth, we had about 90 of our Industrial branches were closed. So, it's going to have a little bit of an impact probably for a couple of days. But, again, we'll recover. And I expect that will have a positive impact longer-term on our business. Hey Daniel, I'll just add a comment to that as well because it's been mentioned before, and I touched on it in my prepared remarks. But just to call out, in our NAPA business here across the U.S., we have over 3,000 sales professionals between our Company stores and our independent stores that are working with our shops and professional garages every day. So, the thought of did we cut too deep, we don't believe so. And again, I think, what we saw were some transitory challenges in \u201820 that are going to bounce back in \u201821. Well, look David, it's a reasonable question. We've been working on a number of initiatives throughout the course of 2020 that I would tell you I think are really beginning to take hold. We are not nearly as weighted towards the DIY side. So, even though we're seeing some nice lift in DIY, it's not going to move the needle for us like DIFM. So, what I would point to and how we're narrowing that gap is the slight recovery we're seeing from COVID, markets opening back up, I think, we're going to see miles driven tick back up. We haven't seen any official numbers out of December, January yet. But that coupled with some winter weather is all going to help spike our DIFM business. And again, we're really, really pleased to see that spike in the month of January."

Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are staying safe and well. During the quarter, we remained focused on our top priorities, which include ensuring the continued health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we operate; execution of our strategic initiatives and cost actions for our global Automotive and Industrial segments to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results; management of our working capital to drive strong free cash flow and pay down debt to further strengthen our financial position, and enhance liquidity; effective capital deployment, including strategic reinvestments in the business, paying a consistent dividend to our shareholders and the repayment of debt as appropriate; and finally, we also advanced our ESG initiatives with the release of our 2020 Corporate Sustainability Report. Carol and I look forward to covering our progress in each of these areas today, and then taking your questions. Our teams continued to execute with agility through the third quarter, aggressively managing each of our operations through the challenges of COVID-19. We are proud of their hard work and commitment to operational excellence, which has required effective measures to maintain a safe work environment, while also providing first-class customer service. Through the quarter, we engaged with our teams at every level and resumed field visits to connect with our employees, customers and suppliers. We can tell you firsthand that through the adaptability and successful execution of our passionate and talented associates, we are fully operational and prepared with comprehensive readiness plans, should a second wave begin to materially affect our businesses. So, a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team members across our global footprint. Upon the divestiture of our Business Products group in June, we entered the third quarter focused on driving profitable growth and productivity initiatives for our streamlined portfolio of our Automotive and Industrial business segment. As you may recall, exiting non-core operations is one of several key steps in the transformation of the Company. In addition, we are also investing in higher return businesses to further expand and strengthen our core. Moving on to our financial results. We achieved a strong financial performance in the third quarter that reflects the resiliency of our businesses and the benefits of our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions taken across our operations. Total sales for the third quarter were $4.4 billion, up 1% excluding the impact of divestitures. This was a significant improvement from the 10% sales decline in the second quarter, due to the impact of COVID-19. Total operating margin was 9%, a 100 basis-point improvement from last year, achieved through solid progress in both gross margin and SG&A, driving margin expansion in each of our Automotive and Industrial businesses. Adjusted net income was $237 million and adjusted earnings per share was a $1.63, up 17%. Our cost savings plan, announced in October of 2019, has generated significant savings across the organization in 2020. Through the first nine months, we have already achieved our $100 million cost savings target for the full year. In addition, cost actions in response to COVID-19 further boosted our operating results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on finding additional cost savings to further improve our cost structure and long-term profitability. Let me mention one example of the many initiatives to improve our operational efficiencies and customer service levels. We were excited to open our newest U.S. automotive distribution center in Nashville, Tennessee just last month. Nashville is a 325,000 square-foot distribution center, equipped with systems equipped with systems and efficiencies to enable high productivity and the service of over 300-plus NAPA stores. By bringing this facility on line, we'll be able to close or consolidate smaller, less productive DCs in the NAPA network. The opening of Nashville and consolidation of these operations has gone smoothly, despite the impact of COVID-19. We would like to thank our operations team for the great work on this important project. We will continue to make additional supply chain investments in the years to come. We also improved our working capital, enhanced our liquidity, while generating another quarter of substantial cash flows. Turning to our business segments. Automotive represented 68% of total sales in the third quarter and Industrial was 32% of total sales. By geography, 76% of revenues are attributable to North America with 14% to Europe and 10% Australasia. Total sales for the global Automotive Group were $3 billion, a 6% increase from last year, and improved sequentially from the 10% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales also turned positive, up 2.2%, compared to a 12.6% decrease in Q2. A solid automotive recovery on the top-line with a consistent growth pattern in each month through the quarter helped us deliver a 100 basis-point improvement in operating margin. In North America, our U.S. automotive sales were down approximately 1%, which is significantly improved from the 12% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales were down 2.8% and much improved from the 13.8% decrease in Q2. In addition, we were encouraged by an impressive 60 basis-point increase in operating margin for U.S. automotive. In Canada, sales for the third quarter were up 2.6%, and improved from a 13% decrease in Q2. Comp sales increased by 0.5% and operating margin was up a strong 200 basis points. So, a solid quarter for our Canadian team. Also in North America, sales to our retail customers continued to outperform, up low-double-digits for the third quarter. While retail sales peaked in July, this customer segment remained solid through the quarter as the persistence of COVID continued to drive outsized DIY growth, although we believe this surge in demand is gradually moderating. We continue to strengthen our retail positioning through our ongoing initiatives, such as store refreshes, NAPA rewards program, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising and inventory. In addition, our growing omni-channel capabilities, including the recent addition of 35,000 new SKUs and direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers continue to drive exceptional value for the retail customer. This has led to online retail sales that doubled our 2019 volume, and we expect continued strong omni-channel growth at NAPA in the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving on to our DIFM business. Sales to commercial accounts were down low-single-digits in the third quarter, which is much improved from last quarter and an encouraging indicator that consumers are becoming more mobile and getting back out on the road. As miles driven continued their slow recovery, sales trends across each of our customer channels strengthened relative to Q2, with our independent unaffiliated professional repair accounts leading the way and posting positive sales growth. Looking forward, we expect this customer segment as well as our fleet and government accounts, national accounts and NAPA auto care centers to strengthen further in the months ahead. Among these customers, our fleet and government segment remained the most pressured, as many of these operations are running at less than capacity due to slower business conditions and/or budgetary constraints. This is especially true for our customers in the energy and airline industries, which have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. To counter these and other commercial headwinds, our teams are executing on a number of recovery plans designed to optimize NAPA's customer value proposition, sell more parts and gain market share. These plans focus on maximizing the effectiveness of our new sales structure, improvements to key programs such as NAPA auto care, enhance systems and digital capabilities, as well as strategic pricing initiatives and improved inventory availability. While our team has made significant progress in the quarter, we expect our focus in these areas and favorable fundamentals to drive meaningful results in the period ahead. Those favorable fundamentals include the growing number of vehicles in the 6 to 12-year aftermarket sweet spot, and the recent spike in new car sales, low gas prices and continued improvement in miles driven. In Europe, aftermarket sales trends had a strong rebound in the third quarter, and our team did a tremendous job of capitalizing on that. Total sales were up an impressive 16%, which is improved from a 3% sales decrease in the second quarter. And comp sales were up a strong 12%, compared to last quarter's mid-teen decline. Importantly, this quarter's sales growth, combined with our ongoing cost savings initiatives, drove a 140 basis-point margin improvement, marking a significant step forward for this group. In breaking down our overall European performance, we are very pleased that operations in each country recovered with positive sales comp, driven by the broad surge in demand for deferred maintenance and repairs. In addition, the powerful NAPA brand has proven to be an effective growth driver. We have introduced the NAPA brand in the UK and France, and plan to roll it out in Germany this month. We posted our strongest European sales in the UK this past quarter, and NAPA branded products have grown to represent a low-double-digit percentage of total sales in less than one year. As a reminder, we identified the opportunity for private brands in Europe at the time of our initial discussions to acquire AAG back in 2017. We are encouraged by the quick acceptance of the NAPA brand and excited for its growth potential. Likewise, our focus on driving growth with key existing and new accounts, including the larger national account customers also contributed to our recovery. So, again, just a fantastic job by the team in Europe on both the top and bottom lines. Turning now to our automotive operations in Australia and New Zealand. This team reported another quarter of exceptional results, with total sales increasing 16% and comp sales up strong at plus 15%. This follows a 4% total sales increase and a 2% core sales increase in the second quarter. Our strong sales for the quarter reflect a robust sales environment for both, the commercial and retail customer segments in the Australasian region, and our team is well-positioned with a 60% commercial and 40% DIY sales mix. We're encouraged by the current sales climate, despite ongoing headwinds due to COVID-related restrictions in select key markets, such as Melbourne, and the state of Victoria. To drive this growth, our team in Australasia is executing on several growth initiatives. These include the continued rollout of the NAPA brand, and new NAPA store openings, digital enhancements across the B2C and B2B platform, strategic pricing and targeted marketing. These and other initiatives as well as the ongoing cost actions across our operations generated a strong 180 basis-point improvement and operating margin for the quarter. So, in summary, we are pleased with the recovery in the aftermarket, and our automotive performance across North America, Europe and Australasia. So, now, let's turn to our results for the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4 billion, down 8.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales were down 9.2%, a significant improvement from the comp sales decline of 16.7% in the second quarter. These sales results as well as our ongoing focus to drive meaningful cost savings and optimizing our distribution network drove an 80 basis-point improvement in net operating margin for the quarter. In North America, our total sales were down 9.7% as compared to a 16.7% decrease in Q2. We saw strengthening trends in industrial indicators over the last several months, and an improving sales cadence in each month of the quarter. Specifically, the ISM PMI, industrial production and capacity utilization have all pointed to increasing industrial activity since we last reported, and we expect these trends to continue in the months ahead. We would also add that as customers reopen their plants, we will capitalize on more onsite sales opportunities. We are also beginning to see an increase in CapEx orders among many of our customers, many of which were deferred due to crisis. So, we see a number of positive signs for the industry ahead. Throughout the pandemic, our team has been executing on our growth strategy to further bolster Motion's leading competitive position in the MRO industry. We are focused on initiatives to expand our industrial services and solutions capabilities, enhance our pricing and category management strategy, and optimize the effectiveness of our Motion Industries website, which we re-launched just last quarter. Each of these initiatives has added value for the Company and our customers. For the quarter, our automation solutions group was our strongest operation, posting high-single-digit growth. We are building out this operation to further support the growing mega trend of plant automation and robotics at our customers. In contrast, the southwest region of the U.S. was our weakest due to the significant impact of COVID on the oil and gas sector in that area of the country. We were also pleased to complete three strategic bolt-on acquisitions in North America during the quarter. Two of these businesses specialize in motion control, and automation products and services, including engineering and application expertise and aluminum extrusion, which complement our growing MI automation solutions group. Our third acquisition expands our hydraulics business at Motion Canada. Combined, these operations, further expand our presence in strategic geographies and overall products and service offerings, and are expected to contribute approximately $35 million to $40 million in annual revenues. So, to summarize our North American industrial performance, we were encouraged by the gradual improvement and sales trends throughout the quarter. Our team also operated well and was very-disciplined in applying their cost control measures, which we believe bodes well for continued progress in the months ahead, as the industrial economy strengthens further. Turning to Australasia, July 1 marked the anniversary of our MI Asia Pac acquisition, and this team delivered a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter. While we continue to benefit from the strength of local mining industry, we are also executing on our new branding strategy and other growth initiatives to drive sales and gain market share. In addition, the MI Asia Pac team is operating well and making excellent progress on key cost reduction and working cap initiatives. Another focus area for GPC has been the advancement of our ESG initiatives. To account for our progress in this important area, we issued our first sustainability report back in 2018, and followed that up with a summary update in 2019. On September 30th, we were pleased to issue our 2020 Sustainability Report. This year's report substantially expands our disclosure across the ESG spectrum, such as human capital and diversity and inclusion, among others. In developing our disclosure, we engaged with our top shareholders to ensure our pathway to ESG best practices, aligned with the expectations of these key stakeholders. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view this report and learn more about our company-wide commitment to ESG. As we move forward through the balance of 2020 and into 2021, our teams will execute on a number of strategic initiatives to build on the positive momentum of the third quarter. These plans and initiatives are grounded in a strategic growth framework, focused on maximizing the value of our Automotive and Industrial business segments and positioning GPC for sustained long-term growth and improved profitability. Key elements of the framework include capturing more wallet share with existing customers and acquiring new customers; introducing new products and services, while innovating our omni-channel strategy and expanding digital offerings; building a global branding strategy to further leverage our powerful NAPA and MI brands, which we have initiated via the rollout of the NAPA brand into Europe and Australasia; and the rebranding of our Inenco Industrial Business to MI Asia Pac; expanding our global geographic footprint, including acquiring strategic bolt-on businesses. And finally, our strategic framework includes ongoing transformation initiative to achieve operational excellence as exemplified by our cost actions and other initiatives. So, now, I'll turn it over to Carol for a deeper review of our financials. Carol?\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Paul. As a reminder, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude transaction, restructuring and other costs and income. Total GPC sales were $4.4 billion in the third quarter, down 3.4% from 2019 or up 1%, excluding divestitures, which is much improved from the 10% decline in the second quarter. We're also pleased to report our 12th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 35% compared to 33.4% in the third quarter last year. The 160 basis-point improvement primarily reflects the benefit of sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix, especially in industrial. The broad improvement was driven by our focus on strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. The divestiture of EIS last September 30th was also accretive to gross margin performance. These items were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing environment has remained stable thus far in 2020 with limited supplier price increases and very little inflation in our third quarter sales. Based on the current pricing environment, we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of the year. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter, down 1.7% from last year and representing 26.1% of sales compared to 25.6% last year on an adjusted basis. The decrease in operating expenses reflects the favorable impact of both, our permanent and COVID-related costs actions implemented thus far in 2020, as previously mentioned by Paul. In accordance with our $100 million cost savings plan announced late in 2019, we're pleased to report that we have successfully achieved the $100 million annual target well ahead of schedule. With more than $40 million in savings recognized in the third quarter, our permanent expense reductions totaled over $110 million for the nine months. In addition, our teams have continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed approximately $60 million in incremental savings in the third quarter. So, combined, we generated approximately $100 million in cost savings during the third quarter, driven by strategic reductions and payroll and facility costs, as well as more temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, freight changes and other initiatives in response to COVID. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to execute on our cost actions, and we currently expect to achieve $130 million to $140 million in permanent cost savings for 2020, which will carry over into 2021. We also expect to generate further savings related to COVID-19 but have less clarity here, as these cost savings will moderate as the economic recovery continues and sales volumes increase. Despite the continued uncertainty, we enter the fourth quarter focused on driving growth and aggressively managing our expenses to maximize profitability. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the third quarter, reflecting a decrease of 1.5% from last year and comprising 27.9% of sales. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was $392 million, up 9% on a 3% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, total segment profit, increased 13% on a 1% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 9.0%, a strong increase of 100 basis points. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4% on an adjusted basis, down from 24.9% in the prior year period, due primarily to the benefit of statute related adjustments. Our net income from continuing operations in the third quarter was $233 million with earning per share of a $1.61. Our adjusted net income was $237 million or $1.63 per share, which compares to $204 million and $1.39 per share in 2019 or a 17% increase. So, now, let's discuss our third quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $3 billion, up 6% from the prior year and sequentially improved from the 10% sales decline last quarter. Our segment profit at $266 million was up 20% with a profit margin of 9.0%, compared to 8.0% in the third quarter of 2019. The 100 basis-point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our automotive businesses, which was a great job by our teams and a testament to their continued focus on meaningful cost reductions across our operations. Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an 18.6% decrease from a year ago. Excluding the EIS divestiture, Industrial sales were down approximately 9%, which is a significant improvement from the second quarter. Our segment profit of $126 million was down 8% from a year ago or up slightly excluding EIS, and the profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.9%. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, which was driven by the combination of gross margin expansion and cost savings. We expect to see continued progress in the quarters ahead as the sales environment further recovers. While these sales trends and operating results are encouraging and reflect the recovery from the lows of the second quarter, we continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we believe it's prudent to not reestablish formal financial guidance at this time. So, now, let's turn to our comments on the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.0 billion were down 22% from the prior year, due primarily to the change in sales and the benefit of an agreement to sell $500 million of receivables to a financial institution earlier this year. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and confident about our collection trends, although we continue to closely monitor receivables in light of the current business conditions. Inventory at September 30th was $3.4 billion, up 2% from September of last year, or essentially flat excluding the impact of foreign currency. This is a function of lower purchasing volumes and our continued focus on effective inventory management. Accounts payable of $4.0 billion is up 1% from last year and a reflection of the change in inventory and the impact of lower purchasing volumes. At the end of our quarter, the AP-to-inventory ratio was 118%, which has improved from 112% at June 30th. Our total debt at $2.9 billion is down 15% from $3.4 billion last year and down 10% from the second quarter. During the third quarter, we further strengthened our liquidity position and we entered October with approximately $2.8 billion in available liquidity, which has improved from our $2.6 billion liquidity at June 30th and $1.1 billion in liquidity at March 31st. For the first nine months of 2020, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. This led to strong free cash flows of over $1.3 billion. As a reminder, we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy back in early April to preserve our cash through the duration of COVID-19. However, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash to serve to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in our improved debt leverage of 2.2 times our total debt to adjusted EBITDA, which compares to 2.5 times at the end of the second quarter, and the $4.3 billion in capital deployed across our four key areas in the last three years. These include reinvestments in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth net of divestitures, share repurchases, and the dividend. For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150 million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for share purchases through December 31st. While we've also pulled back on acquisition activity, we've made several strategic bolt-on acquisitions this quarter, as Paul mentioned earlier, and we continue to plan for additional M&A that aligns with our growth strategies for the Automotive and Industrial businesses. And finally, we continue to support the dividend which has increased for 64 consecutive years. So, that's our financial update for the third quarter. We've made significant progress in several key areas. We want to thank our teams for their great work and many accomplishments under these tough circumstances. I'll now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. Through the continued focus on our top priorities, outlined at the beginning of this call, we were pleased to report a strong financial performance for the quarter. Our results highlight our progress in several key areas, including strengthening sales trends, continued gross margin expansion, transformative cost actions and significant cost savings, operating margin expansion in each of our businesses, and a stronger balance sheet, enhanced liquidity and substantial cash flows. We are excited for the future at GPC, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the quarters ahead. We thank you for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. \nBret Jordan: When you think about the cadence of the quarter, I guess NAPA U.S. specifically but also maybe Europe as well, as we came out of the COVID lockdown, could you talk about sort of how businesses either picked up with mobility improving or maybe even softened as stimulus money was spent? And then, I guess, within Europe, talk specifically about the strength you've seen there. Obviously, not as much consumer stimulus in that economy yet seeming to outperform, could you maybe give us some color as to is that share gain that's driving your significant comp or is it just the underlying lift in service demand?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Bret. And let's start with the cadence first, and maybe I'll touch on total Company. In total Company, we were steady throughout the quarter, turning positive. We were pretty much flat in July-August, turned positive in September, total GPC. As we look at automotive again, total automotive, we were consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit all-in July, August and September. Europe, we were really strong in August, but we were double-digit growth in every month and the quarter. And as we look at our turnaround in Europe, I couldn't be more proud of that team over there, Bret. They -- I mean, you guys know what we went through in Q2, most of France was shut down, a good bit of the UK was shut down. And for us, the post that kind of increase that we did in Q3 is strong, and we're seeing it across the board. We're seeing it in every market, which is what's really got us encouraged and we're seeing it across our customer base. So, we saw it in our small independent, unaffiliated shops, but we also saw solid increase with the big national major account. So, do I think we're taking market share in Europe? Perhaps. But, I guess, we'll have to watch that play out. I'd also tell you, Bret, we're really excited about the rollout of our NAPA private label. And I think that really bolstered our sales in the UK this quarter, we're up at 10 different product categories down in the UK. And we're rolling that out in France, and then we'll go into Germany and the Netherlands as well.\nBret Jordan: You might talk about the margin lift from private label.\nCarol Yancey: Yes. The margin on the private label, Bret, as you know, for our private label, we do generally have a more favorable margin when you look at the all-in and consider the terms that we get and the global tenders that we're doing. But generally, we do have a little bit lower price in Europe on that private label. So, it would be neutral in total to Europe on their gross margin. But, the fact is, we're more dollars and we're expanding our market share. And again, when we look at global tenders, there is a GPC benefit, if you will, when you think about global extended terms and putting more volume through our global suppliers.\nPaul Donahue: And Bret, as I called out in my prepared comments, when we first started talking to the AAG team a few years back, we saw a real opportunity to introduce private brand into our European markets, and it's played out honestly exactly as we had hoped and thought of would. And I'll tell you what I'm most encouraged by is the acceptance and I guess the recognition of the NAPA brand in Europe.\nBret Jordan: And I guess, a quick follow-up. Could you talk about any regional performance highlights in the U.S.? And then, Carol you talked about inflation moderating. Do you see anything going on in pricing? And I guess maybe more on the DIY side, I think, there were some comments coming out of zone that they and Walmart have become a bit more competitive. Do you see any pricing changes in the market in general?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Pricing has been really rational, and specific to automotive, we cannot say we've seen much in the way of changes whether it's do-it-for-me or DIY, we've had very minimal price increases through the third quarter, 0.1% in automotive, and we really don't expect much at the end of the year. But again, no supplier price increases and a pretty rational pricing environment.\nPaul Donahue: And Bret as far as the -- your question around regionality, I'm assuming you're talking about the U.S. Much like we saw in the previous quarter, our strongest markets continue to be the Midwest and the mountains. And those two guys are heading are really continuing to do a good job for us, both delivering positive numbers in Q3. Where we're seeing a bit of stress and again, not surprising, the Northeast was down mid-single-digit in the quarter. But I point out, Bret that if you go back to Q2, our Northeastern business, we were down 19% in Q2. We've gone from down 19 to roughly down 4 and change in Q3. Mid Atlantic, similar story, high-double-digit decrease in Q2 to down mid-single-digits in Q3. So, still a bit stressed in those markets. But, what we're encouraged by is just really strong sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And it sounded like Europe, UK might be the strongest market with France number two.\nPaul Donahue: That is correct. Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBeth Reed: Hi. Good morning. This is Beth Reed on for Scot. Just wondering if you guys could help us better understand the cadence of the recovery in auto. I believe the July trends were running about 6% -- first, I just wondered if you could clarify is that sales or comp. I think it was sales, but if you could clarify. And at that time, where were U.S. comps trending. And then lastly, on the U.S. side, did you see trends improve sequentially throughout each month? And any color in cadence maybe around those metrics can be great.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So, we\u2019ll double team this one, Beth. But, the first response, I think, you asked, and I\u2019m trying to recount your questions. I think, the first one was around, was the 6% that was mentioned back in Q2, was that comp or total. That was total,, not comp. Okay? So, did that answer that question?\nBeth Reed: Yes.\nPaul Donahue: Okay. And then, as we look at our automotive business in the quarter it -- again, as I mentioned, our total automotive business was consistent throughout the -- was consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit, and U.S. automotive followed a similar pattern, and it was pretty consistent throughout the quarter.\nBeth Reed: Okay. So, the U.S. auto comps were down low to mid -- low-single-digit each one? \nPaul Donahue: Correct.\nBeth Reed: Okay, got it. And then, just one on the Industrial side\u2026\nPaul Donahue: Hey Beth, I would just add to that. That improved in the month of September.\nBeth Reed: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful.\nCarol Yancey: July -- and you did say, July was flattish. There was -- and again, August, September weren't quite as much as what July was. But in total, it was -- that's our total number.\nBeth Reed: Got it. Okay. On the Industrial side, just with the negative trends continuing, and as you guys mentioned, some of the industries are starting to improve. How should we think about trends in that segment as we look over the next few quarters?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So, just a little bit of history on Motion, because we've seen the cyclical times before in the industrial business. We generally lag the industrial indicators. So again, that's consistent with what we're seeing again in these recent quarters. What we are encouraged by, Beth, is we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. So, September was the strongest month of Q3. And we do believe that as the economy continues to improve, we'll close that gap between our numbers and then what the industrial indicators are showing. So, our -- the takeaway should be, we anticipate improved demand in the coming months. We're seeing really strong results out of our wood and lumber segments of our business, pulp and paper are good. A lot of that is directly tied to the building industry, which is strong. So, we have no doubt Motion will recover and will be in good shape in the quarters ahead.\nBeth Reed: Alright. Thank you so much.\nPaul Donahue: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Chris.\nChris Horvers: I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions there. First on the Motion side. You talked about September being the strongest month, obviously down 9% comps for the quarter. I guess, how close are you to getting to positive there? And then, could you also size up maybe the exposure to weaker industries, like energy and travel?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Well, the energy comment, Chris, that's definitely a headwind for us. If you look at our Southwest part of the United States was certainly our weakest market in the country, and that is largely driven by oil and gas. So, that's a definite headwind for us going forward. And in terms of looking out, Chris, look, it's challenging. I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets. There's no doubt. Our expectation is our Motion business will turn positive in '21. But, I would also tell you, our expectation is that we're going to continue to show sequential improvement. Just as we did from Q2 to Q3, we think Q4 will be an improvement over Q3, and then again, certainly positive in '21.\nChris Horvers: So, would that mean that like Motion in September was more down, like mid to high single-digit versus high single-digit decline in September?\nPaul Donahue: That is correct.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Makes sense. And then, in terms of, just to clarify on the U.S. cadence in particular. Did -- it seems like DIY slowed? And do-it-for-me got better. But, that was sort of roughly neutral over the three months. Is that right? Because you also mentioned that September got better. So, I was just trying to reconcile all that did -- kind of put that all together?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So my, my reference on September, Chris, was in relation to August. September was a better month than what we saw in August. We saw softness in August. And September did improve. Carol mentioned we were flattish in July, and we dipped a bit in September. But again, we're talking just a few basis points from month to month to month. So, not a massive shift. And I'm sorry. I missed -- I forgot the second part of your question, Chris.\nChris Horvers: So, the second part was really like, it seems like the mixed bag in there as like DIY slowing down. One of your competitors, talked about a drop off in August and into September on DIY. So, I guess, maybe, is that what drove sort of the keeping the relative trend flat over the quarter? And then, any comment on did -- and this is U.S., both questions. Did do-it-for-me -- how close are we to positive in September in commercial?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So, our DIY business, and you hit it, Chris. I mean, we had a huge July in DIY and we were up close to 20% in July and it moderated a bit through Q3. But, I mean -- I don't think anybody expects the kind of DIY increases that we're seeing across the industry to continue. Certainly, we've benefited as did all of our peer group from the stimulus money to the hit the markets. Our DIFM business was pretty steady throughout the quarter in that low-single-digit range. And again, I would point out Chris, just as I did with some of the regionality, as I did with Motion, those down low-single-digit, those numbers are improved from the high-single-digit declines that we were seeing back in May in June.\nChris Horvers: Got it, but not -- right, okay. So, but -- so U.S. do-it-for-me was pretty consistent in that down low-single-digit range?\nPaul Donahue: Yes.\nChris Horvers: Okay. Sorry to belabor that. And then, in terms of -- maybe on the on the margin side, really a two-part question. So, first on the on the gross margin, EIS actually helped you. Can you talk about how much that was? But then, vendor allowances also hurt too. So, at the high level, how much, how are you thinking about the potential to continue to drive expanded gross margins going forward? And then, I have a follow-up on SG&A?\nCarol Yancey: Sure. On the gross margin for the quarter, when you look at our quarterly improvement, I would say this quarter, about a third of that was related to the divestitures. So, two-thirds of our gross margin improvement, like 100 bps is really related to sales mixed shift to higher gross margin operations, specifically our international strong results on automotive, product mix shift, especially in Industrial, and then some of our just pricing and global sourcing initiatives. So, when we look ahead, we do expect to have continued gross margin improvement with a lot of our initiatives that may not be quite at the pace that we've seen. But, we are very encouraged by the gross margin initiatives we have. We've done all that, as you mentioned, with lower volumes. And we have been able to generally offset the lower volume incentives with our lower sales volumes with having our initiatives. So, we\u2019ve anniversaried the EIS divestiture. So, going forward, it will just be the core gross margin improvement.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Then on the SG&A side, Carol, I guess, how are you -- you take a lot of cost out of the business, how are you thinking about the potential to add back that COVID expense in 2021 from a dollar\u2019s perspective?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. So on the SG&A side, what we're really encouraged by is the $100 million permanent cost savings that roughly -- or $110 million through nine months. We expect to be $130 million to $140 million for the full year. The COVID savings were $150 million in Q2. And as we mentioned before, about $45 million of that was government subsidies. That moderated to about $60 million in Q3, which relates directly to the improved, as Paul's mentioned, improvement in our volumes, extending hours, bringing folks back in, and we said a lot of those were temporary things. But, part of why we have a higher $100 million permanent savings is, we shifted some of those things to permanent. So, we are still -- we will still have some COVID savings in Q4. It'll be probably less than what it is in Q3. But, I can tell you, all of our business units have additional cost actions. As we look ahead, there are further opportunities we think we'll have, especially as it relates to facilities and productivity improvements, and again, some further consolidations in some back office areas. So, we're still excited about the work the transformation team is doing as we look ahead.\nChris Horvers: Very helpful. Thanks very much.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks. I have a couple of questions. One, I'd love to follow up. Thanks for all the color around U.S. automotive. Could you just level set us now on the mix of that business between independents, the NAPA auto care group, major accounts and fleet, just given how disparate the performance has been this year?\nPaul Donahue: So, if we look at the business, and as you just described, Greg, our most challenging segment -- and look, I should point out at the outset, our modest difference, okay, I think -- and you've been around long enough, Greg, you know that. Fleet and government is a big segment for us, and that has been our most challenged segment. And I should point out that, mix in that fleet and government, we have our oil and gas, energy business, we have large contracts with municipalities, school bus contracts, we have contracts with the airlines, ground equipment. So, all of that is in that fleet and government. And as you can imagine, Greg, that has been a challenging segment and has continued. It'll come back, and we think it will come back and it will come back strong. Our major account business and our auto care business was down slightly in the quarter as well. Where we saw good growth and we are encouraged is with our what we would really classify as our all other wholesale business, and that is our independent unaffiliated garages. That business held up well. And we are encouraged by that -- by those numbers. And we think we can continue to build on that in Q4 and going forward.\nGreg Melich: And if we look at the business, independents and garages, are they now -- are they like half the business or 30% of the business, just -- and fleet and governments may even be down to 20%? Would that be a fair estimate?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So, think of it this way, Greg. When we look at our -- at those segments, fleet is -- and I'll give you round numbers, 20% to 25%. And then, you've got the -- that unaffiliated independent garage segment is probably 40% to 45% of the total. And I'm sorry, Greg, you asked about our independent owners as well. Can you maybe ask that again, that question?\nGreg Melich: Yes. I just want to know, just generally speaking, how the independents are doing. So, what percentage of the mix are they now as opposed to company owned stores? And how are they doing? I mean, how many of them got PPP loans? Are they sort of fully back and up to running the way that you want to versus what they were doing in the second quarter?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. It's a great question, Greg. And I'm glad you did ask that. Independent owners are -- they represent roughly 60% of our business. And I'm pleased to say, our guys have been out, we've been out meeting with some of our big independents, really just this week. They're faring well. And I would tell you that in terms of PPP money, the vast majority, and I'm talking probably close to 90%, got PPP money. So, from a cash position, our independents are doing just fine.\nGreg Melich: Great. And then, if I can, so one more question there. You brought up an interesting addition of 35,000 SKUs. That would be direct from vendor. Could you just help us frame what that could mean to sales and sort of expanding the business in a more capital effective way? And I also thought I heard you mentioned some pricing or re-merchandising actions to help gain some share back. But I was\u2026\nPaul Donahue: So, let's talk about the SKUs that I referenced, the 35,000 SKUs. Think of that Greg as kind of that whole concept around the endless aisle and taking advantage of our great suppliers and their -- the total extent of their catalogue offering. So today, of course, you think of supplier, Greg and I know Dorman well, a great partner of ours for many, many years. They have a very expansive catalog. We don't -- we do not -- we don't catalog all the SKUs that Dorman has available. But, we're certainly now going to make those available online. And we think that's going to -- it's too early to put a number to it, Greg. We really just launched it. But, that would be an example. Another example would be the WeatherTech line. You know that line, of course, great consumer brand. So, we're excited with what we believe that whole kind of endless aisle can do for the NAPA business. And we're going to continue to expand that opportunity going forward.\nGreg Melich: And I hear some -- I heard pricing was rational, but I also thought I heard there were some certain actions maybe in particular segments.\nCarol Yancey: Yes. So, we were talking about rational pricing and really no supplier price increases in automotive. The actions taking both in our Automotive and our Industrial business are really buy side, sell side type pricing, global sourcing type internal gross margin initiatives. Really again, there are no drastic changes in the pricing environment. We've just gotten much more strategic as it relates to both, retail and commercial pricing in our gross margin efforts.\nGreg Melich: So, these are, just so I understand, more strategic, meaning that you're lowering prices to the customer or end up getting more merch margin based on how you're mixing it?\nCarol Yancey: No. I mean, Greg, we've had 12 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement in an environment with lower sales volumes and no inflation and tariffs. And again, we've got pricing, data analytics. We've got investments we've made. Again, we are getting improved gross margin with these initiatives and remaining very competitive. So, the idea is to grow our sales and grow the business. And again, I'm really pleased to see the opportunities and the results that we've gotten in the gross margin area.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Thanks a lot both of you. Good luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last person for questions comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nMitch Ingles: Hey, everyone. This is Mitch Ingles, filling in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. So, most of my questions have already been answered. I just had a quick follow-up on your major accounts group in Automotive. Are these accounts mostly back on line today and purchasing at lower volumes? It sounds like the recovery for Europe for these types of accounts has been relatively solid. Do you expect a similar trend for these accounts in the U.S. in coming months? Any color on the recent trends here would be helpful. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Matt, we -- I'm sorry. We do expect that business to bounce back and it will bounce back as miles driven bounces back. One thing that hasn't really been talked about this morning, even though there's a whole lot more traffic than the roads and people are backed behind the wheel, which we're happy to see. Miles driven in the last couple of months that I've seen preliminary numbers, it's still down close to 10%. So, as that begins to come back and it will come back, the major account business and all of the commercial business will recover. So, yes, no doubt, you mentioned, our European business and we are very pleased with our major account business in the UK and some of the strength that we saw certainly in Q3 in our European business. And we expect -- quite honestly, we expect that to continue well into 2021.\nMitch Ingles: Great. Thanks for the color. And best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: We'd like to thank all of you for your participation in today's call, and we look forward to reporting our year-end results in February. Thank you very much for your support of Genuine Parts Company. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. As a reminder, our comments this morning will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude transaction, restructuring and other costs and income. Total GPC sales were $4.4 billion in the third quarter, down 3.4% from 2019 or up 1%, excluding divestitures, which is much improved from the 10% decline in the second quarter. We're also pleased to report our 12th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 35% compared to 33.4% in the third quarter last year. The 160 basis-point improvement primarily reflects the benefit of sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations, positive product mix, especially in industrial. The broad improvement was driven by our focus on strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. The divestiture of EIS last September 30th was also accretive to gross margin performance. These items were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing environment has remained stable thus far in 2020 with limited supplier price increases and very little inflation in our third quarter sales. Based on the current pricing environment, we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of the year. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the third quarter, down 1.7% from last year and representing 26.1% of sales compared to 25.6% last year on an adjusted basis. The decrease in operating expenses reflects the favorable impact of both, our permanent and COVID-related costs actions implemented thus far in 2020, as previously mentioned by Paul. In accordance with our $100 million cost savings plan announced late in 2019, we're pleased to report that we have successfully achieved the $100 million annual target well ahead of schedule. With more than $40 million in savings recognized in the third quarter, our permanent expense reductions totaled over $110 million for the nine months. In addition, our teams have continued to execute on a number of additional savings initiatives in response to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed approximately $60 million in incremental savings in the third quarter. So, combined, we generated approximately $100 million in cost savings during the third quarter, driven by strategic reductions and payroll and facility costs, as well as more temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, freight changes and other initiatives in response to COVID. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue to execute on our cost actions, and we currently expect to achieve $130 million to $140 million in permanent cost savings for 2020, which will carry over into 2021. We also expect to generate further savings related to COVID-19 but have less clarity here, as these cost savings will moderate as the economic recovery continues and sales volumes increase. Despite the continued uncertainty, we enter the fourth quarter focused on driving growth and aggressively managing our expenses to maximize profitability. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the third quarter, reflecting a decrease of 1.5% from last year and comprising 27.9% of sales. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was $392 million, up 9% on a 3% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, total segment profit, increased 13% on a 1% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 9.0%, a strong increase of 100 basis points. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 23.4% on an adjusted basis, down from 24.9% in the prior year period, due primarily to the benefit of statute related adjustments. Our net income from continuing operations in the third quarter was $233 million with earning per share of a $1.61. Our adjusted net income was $237 million or $1.63 per share, which compares to $204 million and $1.39 per share in 2019 or a 17% increase. So, now, let's discuss our third quarter results by segment. Our Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $3 billion, up 6% from the prior year and sequentially improved from the 10% sales decline last quarter. Our segment profit at $266 million was up 20% with a profit margin of 9.0%, compared to 8.0% in the third quarter of 2019. The 100 basis-point increase in margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our automotive businesses, which was a great job by our teams and a testament to their continued focus on meaningful cost reductions across our operations. Our Industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an 18.6% decrease from a year ago. Excluding the EIS divestiture, Industrial sales were down approximately 9%, which is a significant improvement from the second quarter. Our segment profit of $126 million was down 8% from a year ago or up slightly excluding EIS, and the profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.9%. The improved margin for Industrial reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, which was driven by the combination of gross margin expansion and cost savings. We expect to see continued progress in the quarters ahead as the sales environment further recovers. While these sales trends and operating results are encouraging and reflect the recovery from the lows of the second quarter, we continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we believe it's prudent to not reestablish formal financial guidance at this time. So, now, let's turn to our comments on the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.0 billion were down 22% from the prior year, due primarily to the change in sales and the benefit of an agreement to sell $500 million of receivables to a financial institution earlier this year. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and confident about our collection trends, although we continue to closely monitor receivables in light of the current business conditions. Inventory at September 30th was $3.4 billion, up 2% from September of last year, or essentially flat excluding the impact of foreign currency. This is a function of lower purchasing volumes and our continued focus on effective inventory management. Accounts payable of $4.0 billion is up 1% from last year and a reflection of the change in inventory and the impact of lower purchasing volumes. At the end of our quarter, the AP-to-inventory ratio was 118%, which has improved from 112% at June 30th. Our total debt at $2.9 billion is down 15% from $3.4 billion last year and down 10% from the second quarter. During the third quarter, we further strengthened our liquidity position and we entered October with approximately $2.8 billion in available liquidity, which has improved from our $2.6 billion liquidity at June 30th and $1.1 billion in liquidity at March 31st. For the first nine months of 2020, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. This led to strong free cash flows of over $1.3 billion. As a reminder, we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy back in early April to preserve our cash through the duration of COVID-19. However, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash to serve to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in our improved debt leverage of 2.2 times our total debt to adjusted EBITDA, which compares to 2.5 times at the end of the second quarter, and the $4.3 billion in capital deployed across our four key areas in the last three years. These include reinvestments in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth net of divestitures, share repurchases, and the dividend. For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150 million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for share purchases through December 31st. While we've also pulled back on acquisition activity, we've made several strategic bolt-on acquisitions this quarter, as Paul mentioned earlier, and we continue to plan for additional M&A that aligns with our growth strategies for the Automotive and Industrial businesses. And finally, we continue to support the dividend which has increased for 64 consecutive years. So, that's our financial update for the third quarter. We've made significant progress in several key areas. We want to thank our teams for their great work and many accomplishments under these tough circumstances. I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Yes. The margin on the private label, Bret, as you know, for our private label, we do generally have a more favorable margin when you look at the all-in and consider the terms that we get and the global tenders that we're doing. But generally, we do have a little bit lower price in Europe on that private label. So, it would be neutral in total to Europe on their gross margin. But, the fact is, we're more dollars and we're expanding our market share. And again, when we look at global tenders, there is a GPC benefit, if you will, when you think about global extended terms and putting more volume through our global suppliers. Yes. Pricing has been really rational, and specific to automotive, we cannot say we've seen much in the way of changes whether it's do-it-for-me or DIY, we've had very minimal price increases through the third quarter, 0.1% in automotive, and we really don't expect much at the end of the year. But again, no supplier price increases and a pretty rational pricing environment. July -- and you did say, July was flattish. There was -- and again, August, September weren't quite as much as what July was. But in total, it was -- that's our total number. Sure. On the gross margin for the quarter, when you look at our quarterly improvement, I would say this quarter, about a third of that was related to the divestitures. So, two-thirds of our gross margin improvement, like 100 bps is really related to sales mixed shift to higher gross margin operations, specifically our international strong results on automotive, product mix shift, especially in Industrial, and then some of our just pricing and global sourcing initiatives. So, when we look ahead, we do expect to have continued gross margin improvement with a lot of our initiatives that may not be quite at the pace that we've seen. But, we are very encouraged by the gross margin initiatives we have. We've done all that, as you mentioned, with lower volumes. And we have been able to generally offset the lower volume incentives with our lower sales volumes with having our initiatives. So, we've anniversaried the EIS divestiture. So, going forward, it will just be the core gross margin improvement. Yes. So on the SG&A side, what we're really encouraged by is the $100 million permanent cost savings that roughly -- or $110 million through nine months. We expect to be $130 million to $140 million for the full year. The COVID savings were $150 million in Q2. And as we mentioned before, about $45 million of that was government subsidies. That moderated to about $60 million in Q3, which relates directly to the improved, as Paul's mentioned, improvement in our volumes, extending hours, bringing folks back in, and we said a lot of those were temporary things. But, part of why we have a higher $100 million permanent savings is, we shifted some of those things to permanent. So, we are still -- we will still have some COVID savings in Q4. It'll be probably less than what it is in Q3. But, I can tell you, all of our business units have additional cost actions. As we look ahead, there are further opportunities we think we'll have, especially as it relates to facilities and productivity improvements, and again, some further consolidations in some back office areas. So, we're still excited about the work the transformation team is doing as we look ahead. Yes. So, we were talking about rational pricing and really no supplier price increases in automotive. The actions taking both in our Automotive and our Industrial business are really buy side, sell side type pricing, global sourcing type internal gross margin initiatives. Really again, there are no drastic changes in the pricing environment. We've just gotten much more strategic as it relates to both, retail and commercial pricing in our gross margin efforts. No. I mean, Greg, we've had 12 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement in an environment with lower sales volumes and no inflation and tariffs. And again, we've got pricing, data analytics. We've got investments we've made. Again, we are getting improved gross margin with these initiatives and remaining very competitive. So, the idea is to grow our sales and grow the business. And again, I'm really pleased to see the opportunities and the results that we've gotten in the gross margin area. Thank you. We'd like to thank all of you for your participation in today's call, and we look forward to reporting our year-end results in February. Thank you very much for your support of Genuine Parts Company. Have a great day."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you are staying safe and well. During the quarter, we remained focused on our top priorities, which include ensuring the continued health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities in which we operate; execution of our strategic initiatives and cost actions for our global Automotive and Industrial segments to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results; management of our working capital to drive strong free cash flow and pay down debt to further strengthen our financial position, and enhance liquidity; effective capital deployment, including strategic reinvestments in the business, paying a consistent dividend to our shareholders and the repayment of debt as appropriate; and finally, we also advanced our ESG initiatives with the release of our 2020 Corporate Sustainability Report. Carol and I look forward to covering our progress in each of these areas today, and then taking your questions. Our teams continued to execute with agility through the third quarter, aggressively managing each of our operations through the challenges of COVID-19. We are proud of their hard work and commitment to operational excellence, which has required effective measures to maintain a safe work environment, while also providing first-class customer service. Through the quarter, we engaged with our teams at every level and resumed field visits to connect with our employees, customers and suppliers. We can tell you firsthand that through the adaptability and successful execution of our passionate and talented associates, we are fully operational and prepared with comprehensive readiness plans, should a second wave begin to materially affect our businesses. So, a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team members across our global footprint. Upon the divestiture of our Business Products group in June, we entered the third quarter focused on driving profitable growth and productivity initiatives for our streamlined portfolio of our Automotive and Industrial business segment. As you may recall, exiting non-core operations is one of several key steps in the transformation of the Company. In addition, we are also investing in higher return businesses to further expand and strengthen our core. Moving on to our financial results. We achieved a strong financial performance in the third quarter that reflects the resiliency of our businesses and the benefits of our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions taken across our operations. Total sales for the third quarter were $4.4 billion, up 1% excluding the impact of divestitures. This was a significant improvement from the 10% sales decline in the second quarter, due to the impact of COVID-19. Total operating margin was 9%, a 100 basis-point improvement from last year, achieved through solid progress in both gross margin and SG&A, driving margin expansion in each of our Automotive and Industrial businesses. Adjusted net income was $237 million and adjusted earnings per share was a $1.63, up 17%. Our cost savings plan, announced in October of 2019, has generated significant savings across the organization in 2020. Through the first nine months, we have already achieved our $100 million cost savings target for the full year. In addition, cost actions in response to COVID-19 further boosted our operating results. Looking ahead, we remain focused on finding additional cost savings to further improve our cost structure and long-term profitability. Let me mention one example of the many initiatives to improve our operational efficiencies and customer service levels. We were excited to open our newest U.S. automotive distribution center in Nashville, Tennessee just last month. Nashville is a 325,000 square-foot distribution center, equipped with systems equipped with systems and efficiencies to enable high productivity and the service of over 300-plus NAPA stores. By bringing this facility on line, we'll be able to close or consolidate smaller, less productive DCs in the NAPA network. The opening of Nashville and consolidation of these operations has gone smoothly, despite the impact of COVID-19. We would like to thank our operations team for the great work on this important project. We will continue to make additional supply chain investments in the years to come. We also improved our working capital, enhanced our liquidity, while generating another quarter of substantial cash flows. Turning to our business segments. Automotive represented 68% of total sales in the third quarter and Industrial was 32% of total sales. By geography, 76% of revenues are attributable to North America with 14% to Europe and 10% Australasia. Total sales for the global Automotive Group were $3 billion, a 6% increase from last year, and improved sequentially from the 10% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales also turned positive, up 2.2%, compared to a 12.6% decrease in Q2. A solid automotive recovery on the top-line with a consistent growth pattern in each month through the quarter helped us deliver a 100 basis-point improvement in operating margin. In North America, our U.S. automotive sales were down approximately 1%, which is significantly improved from the 12% decrease in the second quarter. Comp sales were down 2.8% and much improved from the 13.8% decrease in Q2. In addition, we were encouraged by an impressive 60 basis-point increase in operating margin for U.S. automotive. In Canada, sales for the third quarter were up 2.6%, and improved from a 13% decrease in Q2. Comp sales increased by 0.5% and operating margin was up a strong 200 basis points. So, a solid quarter for our Canadian team. Also in North America, sales to our retail customers continued to outperform, up low-double-digits for the third quarter. While retail sales peaked in July, this customer segment remained solid through the quarter as the persistence of COVID continued to drive outsized DIY growth, although we believe this surge in demand is gradually moderating. We continue to strengthen our retail positioning through our ongoing initiatives, such as store refreshes, NAPA rewards program, targeted promotions and enhanced merchandising and inventory. In addition, our growing omni-channel capabilities, including the recent addition of 35,000 new SKUs and direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers continue to drive exceptional value for the retail customer. This has led to online retail sales that doubled our 2019 volume, and we expect continued strong omni-channel growth at NAPA in the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving on to our DIFM business. Sales to commercial accounts were down low-single-digits in the third quarter, which is much improved from last quarter and an encouraging indicator that consumers are becoming more mobile and getting back out on the road. As miles driven continued their slow recovery, sales trends across each of our customer channels strengthened relative to Q2, with our independent unaffiliated professional repair accounts leading the way and posting positive sales growth. Looking forward, we expect this customer segment as well as our fleet and government accounts, national accounts and NAPA auto care centers to strengthen further in the months ahead. Among these customers, our fleet and government segment remained the most pressured, as many of these operations are running at less than capacity due to slower business conditions and/or budgetary constraints. This is especially true for our customers in the energy and airline industries, which have been significantly impacted by the pandemic. To counter these and other commercial headwinds, our teams are executing on a number of recovery plans designed to optimize NAPA's customer value proposition, sell more parts and gain market share. These plans focus on maximizing the effectiveness of our new sales structure, improvements to key programs such as NAPA auto care, enhance systems and digital capabilities, as well as strategic pricing initiatives and improved inventory availability. While our team has made significant progress in the quarter, we expect our focus in these areas and favorable fundamentals to drive meaningful results in the period ahead. Those favorable fundamentals include the growing number of vehicles in the 6 to 12-year aftermarket sweet spot, and the recent spike in new car sales, low gas prices and continued improvement in miles driven. In Europe, aftermarket sales trends had a strong rebound in the third quarter, and our team did a tremendous job of capitalizing on that. Total sales were up an impressive 16%, which is improved from a 3% sales decrease in the second quarter. And comp sales were up a strong 12%, compared to last quarter's mid-teen decline. Importantly, this quarter's sales growth, combined with our ongoing cost savings initiatives, drove a 140 basis-point margin improvement, marking a significant step forward for this group. In breaking down our overall European performance, we are very pleased that operations in each country recovered with positive sales comp, driven by the broad surge in demand for deferred maintenance and repairs. In addition, the powerful NAPA brand has proven to be an effective growth driver. We have introduced the NAPA brand in the UK and France, and plan to roll it out in Germany this month. We posted our strongest European sales in the UK this past quarter, and NAPA branded products have grown to represent a low-double-digit percentage of total sales in less than one year. As a reminder, we identified the opportunity for private brands in Europe at the time of our initial discussions to acquire AAG back in 2017. We are encouraged by the quick acceptance of the NAPA brand and excited for its growth potential. Likewise, our focus on driving growth with key existing and new accounts, including the larger national account customers also contributed to our recovery. So, again, just a fantastic job by the team in Europe on both the top and bottom lines. Turning now to our automotive operations in Australia and New Zealand. This team reported another quarter of exceptional results, with total sales increasing 16% and comp sales up strong at plus 15%. This follows a 4% total sales increase and a 2% core sales increase in the second quarter. Our strong sales for the quarter reflect a robust sales environment for both, the commercial and retail customer segments in the Australasian region, and our team is well-positioned with a 60% commercial and 40% DIY sales mix. We're encouraged by the current sales climate, despite ongoing headwinds due to COVID-related restrictions in select key markets, such as Melbourne, and the state of Victoria. To drive this growth, our team in Australasia is executing on several growth initiatives. These include the continued rollout of the NAPA brand, and new NAPA store openings, digital enhancements across the B2C and B2B platform, strategic pricing and targeted marketing. These and other initiatives as well as the ongoing cost actions across our operations generated a strong 180 basis-point improvement and operating margin for the quarter. So, in summary, we are pleased with the recovery in the aftermarket, and our automotive performance across North America, Europe and Australasia. So, now, let's turn to our results for the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4 billion, down 8.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales were down 9.2%, a significant improvement from the comp sales decline of 16.7% in the second quarter. These sales results as well as our ongoing focus to drive meaningful cost savings and optimizing our distribution network drove an 80 basis-point improvement in net operating margin for the quarter. In North America, our total sales were down 9.7% as compared to a 16.7% decrease in Q2. We saw strengthening trends in industrial indicators over the last several months, and an improving sales cadence in each month of the quarter. Specifically, the ISM PMI, industrial production and capacity utilization have all pointed to increasing industrial activity since we last reported, and we expect these trends to continue in the months ahead. We would also add that as customers reopen their plants, we will capitalize on more onsite sales opportunities. We are also beginning to see an increase in CapEx orders among many of our customers, many of which were deferred due to crisis. So, we see a number of positive signs for the industry ahead. Throughout the pandemic, our team has been executing on our growth strategy to further bolster Motion's leading competitive position in the MRO industry. We are focused on initiatives to expand our industrial services and solutions capabilities, enhance our pricing and category management strategy, and optimize the effectiveness of our Motion Industries website, which we re-launched just last quarter. Each of these initiatives has added value for the Company and our customers. For the quarter, our automation solutions group was our strongest operation, posting high-single-digit growth. We are building out this operation to further support the growing mega trend of plant automation and robotics at our customers. In contrast, the southwest region of the U.S. was our weakest due to the significant impact of COVID on the oil and gas sector in that area of the country. We were also pleased to complete three strategic bolt-on acquisitions in North America during the quarter. Two of these businesses specialize in motion control, and automation products and services, including engineering and application expertise and aluminum extrusion, which complement our growing MI automation solutions group. Our third acquisition expands our hydraulics business at Motion Canada. Combined, these operations, further expand our presence in strategic geographies and overall products and service offerings, and are expected to contribute approximately $35 million to $40 million in annual revenues. So, to summarize our North American industrial performance, we were encouraged by the gradual improvement and sales trends throughout the quarter. Our team also operated well and was very-disciplined in applying their cost control measures, which we believe bodes well for continued progress in the months ahead, as the industrial economy strengthens further. Turning to Australasia, July 1 marked the anniversary of our MI Asia Pac acquisition, and this team delivered a low single-digit sales increase for the quarter. While we continue to benefit from the strength of local mining industry, we are also executing on our new branding strategy and other growth initiatives to drive sales and gain market share. In addition, the MI Asia Pac team is operating well and making excellent progress on key cost reduction and working cap initiatives. Another focus area for GPC has been the advancement of our ESG initiatives. To account for our progress in this important area, we issued our first sustainability report back in 2018, and followed that up with a summary update in 2019. On September 30th, we were pleased to issue our 2020 Sustainability Report. This year's report substantially expands our disclosure across the ESG spectrum, such as human capital and diversity and inclusion, among others. In developing our disclosure, we engaged with our top shareholders to ensure our pathway to ESG best practices, aligned with the expectations of these key stakeholders. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view this report and learn more about our company-wide commitment to ESG. As we move forward through the balance of 2020 and into 2021, our teams will execute on a number of strategic initiatives to build on the positive momentum of the third quarter. These plans and initiatives are grounded in a strategic growth framework, focused on maximizing the value of our Automotive and Industrial business segments and positioning GPC for sustained long-term growth and improved profitability. Key elements of the framework include capturing more wallet share with existing customers and acquiring new customers; introducing new products and services, while innovating our omni-channel strategy and expanding digital offerings; building a global branding strategy to further leverage our powerful NAPA and MI brands, which we have initiated via the rollout of the NAPA brand into Europe and Australasia; and the rebranding of our Inenco Industrial Business to MI Asia Pac; expanding our global geographic footprint, including acquiring strategic bolt-on businesses. And finally, our strategic framework includes ongoing transformation initiative to achieve operational excellence as exemplified by our cost actions and other initiatives. So, now, I'll turn it over to Carol for a deeper review of our financials. Carol? Thank you, Carol. Through the continued focus on our top priorities, outlined at the beginning of this call, we were pleased to report a strong financial performance for the quarter. Our results highlight our progress in several key areas, including strengthening sales trends, continued gross margin expansion, transformative cost actions and significant cost savings, operating margin expansion in each of our businesses, and a stronger balance sheet, enhanced liquidity and substantial cash flows. We are excited for the future at GPC, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in the quarters ahead. We thank you for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Yes. Thanks, Bret. And let's start with the cadence first, and maybe I'll touch on total Company. In total Company, we were steady throughout the quarter, turning positive. We were pretty much flat in July-August, turned positive in September, total GPC. As we look at automotive again, total automotive, we were consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit all-in July, August and September. Europe, we were really strong in August, but we were double-digit growth in every month and the quarter. And as we look at our turnaround in Europe, I couldn't be more proud of that team over there, Bret. They -- I mean, you guys know what we went through in Q2, most of France was shut down, a good bit of the UK was shut down. And for us, the post that kind of increase that we did in Q3 is strong, and we're seeing it across the board. We're seeing it in every market, which is what's really got us encouraged and we're seeing it across our customer base. So, we saw it in our small independent, unaffiliated shops, but we also saw solid increase with the big national major account. So, do I think we're taking market share in Europe? Perhaps. But, I guess, we'll have to watch that play out. I'd also tell you, Bret, we're really excited about the rollout of our NAPA private label. And I think that really bolstered our sales in the UK this quarter, we're up at 10 different product categories down in the UK. And we're rolling that out in France, and then we'll go into Germany and the Netherlands as well. And Bret, as I called out in my prepared comments, when we first started talking to the AAG team a few years back, we saw a real opportunity to introduce private brand into our European markets, and it's played out honestly exactly as we had hoped and thought of would. And I'll tell you what I'm most encouraged by is the acceptance and I guess the recognition of the NAPA brand in Europe. And Bret as far as the -- your question around regionality, I'm assuming you're talking about the U.S. Much like we saw in the previous quarter, our strongest markets continue to be the Midwest and the mountains. And those two guys are heading are really continuing to do a good job for us, both delivering positive numbers in Q3. Where we're seeing a bit of stress and again, not surprising, the Northeast was down mid-single-digit in the quarter. But I point out, Bret that if you go back to Q2, our Northeastern business, we were down 19% in Q2. We've gone from down 19 to roughly down 4 and change in Q3. Mid Atlantic, similar story, high-double-digit decrease in Q2 to down mid-single-digits in Q3. So, still a bit stressed in those markets. But, what we're encouraged by is just really strong sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. That is correct. Absolutely. Yes. So, we'll double team this one, Beth. But, the first response, I think, you asked, and I'm trying to recount your questions. I think, the first one was around, was the 6% that was mentioned back in Q2, was that comp or total. That was total,, not comp. Okay? So, did that answer that question? Okay. And then, as we look at our automotive business in the quarter it -- again, as I mentioned, our total automotive business was consistent throughout the -- was consistent throughout the quarter, mid-single-digit, and U.S. automotive followed a similar pattern, and it was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. Correct. Hey Beth, I would just add to that. That improved in the month of September. Yes. So, just a little bit of history on Motion, because we've seen the cyclical times before in the industrial business. We generally lag the industrial indicators. So again, that's consistent with what we're seeing again in these recent quarters. What we are encouraged by, Beth, is we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter. So, September was the strongest month of Q3. And we do believe that as the economy continues to improve, we'll close that gap between our numbers and then what the industrial indicators are showing. So, our -- the takeaway should be, we anticipate improved demand in the coming months. We're seeing really strong results out of our wood and lumber segments of our business, pulp and paper are good. A lot of that is directly tied to the building industry, which is strong. So, we have no doubt Motion will recover and will be in good shape in the quarters ahead. You're welcome. Hey, Chris. Yes. Well, the energy comment, Chris, that's definitely a headwind for us. If you look at our Southwest part of the United States was certainly our weakest market in the country, and that is largely driven by oil and gas. So, that's a definite headwind for us going forward. And in terms of looking out, Chris, look, it's challenging. I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets. There's no doubt. Our expectation is our Motion business will turn positive in '21. But, I would also tell you, our expectation is that we're going to continue to show sequential improvement. Just as we did from Q2 to Q3, we think Q4 will be an improvement over Q3, and then again, certainly positive in '21. That is correct. Yes. So my, my reference on September, Chris, was in relation to August. September was a better month than what we saw in August. We saw softness in August. And September did improve. Carol mentioned we were flattish in July, and we dipped a bit in September. But again, we're talking just a few basis points from month to month to month. So, not a massive shift. And I'm sorry. I missed -- I forgot the second part of your question, Chris. Yes. So, our DIY business, and you hit it, Chris. I mean, we had a huge July in DIY and we were up close to 20% in July and it moderated a bit through Q3. But, I mean -- I don't think anybody expects the kind of DIY increases that we're seeing across the industry to continue. Certainly, we've benefited as did all of our peer group from the stimulus money to the hit the markets. Our DIFM business was pretty steady throughout the quarter in that low-single-digit range. And again, I would point out Chris, just as I did with some of the regionality, as I did with Motion, those down low-single-digit, those numbers are improved from the high-single-digit declines that we were seeing back in May in June. Yes. Thank you, Chris. So, if we look at the business, and as you just described, Greg, our most challenging segment -- and look, I should point out at the outset, our modest difference, okay, I think -- and you've been around long enough, Greg, you know that. Fleet and government is a big segment for us, and that has been our most challenged segment. And I should point out that, mix in that fleet and government, we have our oil and gas, energy business, we have large contracts with municipalities, school bus contracts, we have contracts with the airlines, ground equipment. So, all of that is in that fleet and government. And as you can imagine, Greg, that has been a challenging segment and has continued. It'll come back, and we think it will come back and it will come back strong. Our major account business and our auto care business was down slightly in the quarter as well. Where we saw good growth and we are encouraged is with our what we would really classify as our all other wholesale business, and that is our independent unaffiliated garages. That business held up well. And we are encouraged by that -- by those numbers. And we think we can continue to build on that in Q4 and going forward. Yes. So, think of it this way, Greg. When we look at our -- at those segments, fleet is -- and I'll give you round numbers, 20% to 25%. And then, you've got the -- that unaffiliated independent garage segment is probably 40% to 45% of the total. And I'm sorry, Greg, you asked about our independent owners as well. Can you maybe ask that again, that question? Yes. It's a great question, Greg. And I'm glad you did ask that. Independent owners are -- they represent roughly 60% of our business. And I'm pleased to say, our guys have been out, we've been out meeting with some of our big independents, really just this week. They're faring well. And I would tell you that in terms of PPP money, the vast majority, and I'm talking probably close to 90%, got PPP money. So, from a cash position, our independents are doing just fine. So, let's talk about the SKUs that I referenced, the 35,000 SKUs. Think of that Greg as kind of that whole concept around the endless aisle and taking advantage of our great suppliers and their -- the total extent of their catalogue offering. So today, of course, you think of supplier, Greg and I know Dorman well, a great partner of ours for many, many years. They have a very expansive catalog. We don't -- we do not -- we don't catalog all the SKUs that Dorman has available. But, we're certainly now going to make those available online. And we think that's going to -- it's too early to put a number to it, Greg. We really just launched it. But, that would be an example. Another example would be the WeatherTech line. You know that line, of course, great consumer brand. So, we're excited with what we believe that whole kind of endless aisle can do for the NAPA business. And we're going to continue to expand that opportunity going forward. Thank you. Yes. Matt, we -- I'm sorry. We do expect that business to bounce back and it will bounce back as miles driven bounces back. One thing that hasn't really been talked about this morning, even though there's a whole lot more traffic than the roads and people are backed behind the wheel, which we're happy to see. Miles driven in the last couple of months that I've seen preliminary numbers, it's still down close to 10%. So, as that begins to come back and it will come back, the major account business and all of the commercial business will recover. So, yes, no doubt, you mentioned, our European business and we are very pleased with our major account business in the UK and some of the strength that we saw certainly in Q3 in our European business. And we expect -- quite honestly, we expect that to continue well into 2021. Yes. Thank you."

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nSidney Jones: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Today's conference call and webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company, Investor Relations website. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.  Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including today's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Finally, please note that we've accounted for the Business Products segment, S.P. Richards, as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We hope you are staying safe and enjoying good health. So as we think about our quarterly performance and long-term focus, we want to highlight 4 key messages today. One, we are aggressively managing our company's operations through the challenges of COVID-19 by managing the short-term dynamics while staying focused on our long-term growth initiatives. This includes rigorous cost management as well as targeted investments to successfully position GPC in the recovery period and beyond.  Two, we delivered strong quarterly results amid the challenging backdrop as we executed on our transformation strategy and omnichannel initiatives. Three, with the sale of our Business Products segment and our streamlined portfolio, we are now well positioned to maximize the full potential of our automotive and industrial segments.  And four, we continue to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt and generating stronger free cash flow. We significantly enhanced our liquidity this quarter and remain in excellent position to deploy capital towards high ROIC initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world in significant ways, both in our personal lives and from a business and economic perspective. We remain focused on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers and our suppliers. We also want to extend another heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and first responders on the front lines of our fight against this outbreak for their commitment to the care and protection of our communities. We are proud of the tireless work by our associates across the global GPC family. As essential businesses, our operations have generally remained fully operational to fulfill critical customer needs, which required hard work under incredibly difficult circumstances. So a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team members for providing exceptional customer service to our partners around the globe.  Working as a team, we have executed with agility through the pandemic, quickly and effectively adopting new safety protocols to ensure a safe work environment. And as mentioned last quarter, we have stepped up our communications with our global teams and our Board to preempt and prepare for developments as much as possible. Overall, our intensified approach to managing our operations has enabled us to enhance our balance sheet flexibility, achieve meaningful cost savings and advanced operational excellence. During the quarter, we also took steps to advance our ESG initiatives, and we plan to highlight these many enhancements in our annual sustainability report to be issued later this year. Environmental, social and governance best practices are an important priority for GPC. Amid the ongoing effect of COVID-19, the S element of ESG has been paramount over the last several months, given the social unrest in our country and the world. At GPC, we have a long-standing corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion and we pledge to be part of an enduring solution to ensure equality for all.  In addition to our progress in these areas, we were pleased to announce the sale of our business products operations, S.P. Richards, on June 30. The sale of SPR represents the culmination of a multiyear strategy to optimize our portfolio and simplify our company. Over the last 3 years, we have reshaped GPC with several divestitures, including Auto Todo, EIS and now SPR and its operations in North America. All in, these divested businesses represent approximately $3 billion in annual revenues, which we have essentially exchanged for higher return investments in our automotive and industrial segments. From here, we move forward with plans to strengthen our focus on sustainable value-enhancing growth and productivity initiatives associated with our faster growing, higher-margin core businesses.  In addition, we will continue to opportunistically expand our global footprint. Our streamlined portfolio has many notable advantages, including scale and volume, the ability to leverage shared services and global branding, as well as synergies associated with common business processes, systems, suppliers and talent. As a more simplified, service-oriented distribution company, we can better maximize the value of GPC and continue to deliver strong results and long-term value.  Now moving on to our financial performance and business update. We entered the second quarter operating in a sales environment pressured by government mandates to prevent the spread of COVID. Broad shelter-in-place restrictions and full lockdowns in markets such as France and New Zealand significantly slowed mobility and overall economic activity. As announced in our May 6 earnings call, April sales were down 30% in automotive and 10% in industrial. And while the industrial segment remained pressured throughout the quarter and was down 12% in June, the automotive group had a strong recovery, down only 2% in June, led by returns to pre-COVID sales volumes in Europe and Australasia.  Total sales for the second quarter were $3.8 billion, down 10.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures, with operating margin of 8.6%, up 40 basis points, and adjusted net income at $191 million, or $1.32 per share. We also delivered improvements in working capital and strong cash flows, which Carol will cover later.  We are pleased to report a 40 basis point improvement in our segment operating profit. This was a significant accomplishment given challenging business conditions and a reflection of the strong leadership, quick decision-making and disciplined execution demonstrated throughout GPC. This approach resulted in continued gross margin expansion and significant actions to adjust our cost structure. And we are well ahead of our original cost savings target for 2020. As we move forward, we expect our teams to maintain this cost discipline and convert many of these temporary expense reductions to permanent and sustainable savings.  So now turning to a review of our business segments. The global automotive group had sales of $2.5 billion in the second quarter, down 10.1% from 2019 and representing 65% of total company revenues. As mentioned earlier, we experienced a sharp decline in sales in April, followed by a strong recovery in both May and June.  In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were down 12%, with comp sales down 13.8%. Despite the challenging top line, we were pleased to deliver a 60 basis point improvement in net operating margin. In Canada, total sales were down approximately 13%, with comp sales down 15% and net operating margin up an impressive 400 basis points. For perspective, both regions showed similar recovery trends throughout the quarter with sales improving from 25% to 30% declines in April to mid-single-digit declines in June.  For the quarter, sales to our retail customers continue to outperform through the pandemic, with positive sales growth in the U.S. and Canada. The strength in retail reflects the benefit of stimulus funds and other macro trends, as well as the positive impact of our omnichannel strategy to create an excellent in-store and online customer experience. As examples, we continue to refresh our NAPA stores, train our store associates and build on our loyalty program, while also enhancing our digital tools to grow our DIY business. Enhanced digital capabilities, such as buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, ship to home and deliver from store are driving increased traffic to our websites and record online sales in both the U.S. and Canada. We expect to benefit from this positive trend in the future through a continued expansion of our digital offering.  Commercial sales remained under pressure as lower demand from our professional shop customers led to declines in hard part categories such as brakes, chassis, ride control and exhaust. In particular, sales to accounts such as municipalities, state governments and fleets, which commonly distinguish our customer base from the competition, were especially hard hit. Overall, we believe the slowdown in commercial sales reflects the decline in miles driven related to COVID-19. However, we are optimistic that miles driven and other growth drivers will improve as consumers get back on the road for both work and personal travel.  Our North American automotive teams have also been busy executing on several transformative initiatives to streamline their organizations. These steps included changes in management structure, further DC rationalization, a sales reorganization and a continued focus on new delivery strategies and digital tools. These actions have already generated incremental cost savings and operational productivity, as evidenced by our improved operating margin in both the U.S. and Canada. We expect these efforts to continue to add value today and over the long term.  So as we mentioned in our last call, we have worked closely with our independently-owned NAPA stores and auto care customers to help them benefit from the financial aid available to small businesses, the vast majority applied for and received PPP assistance. In light of their support and current business trends, we remain confident in the lasting financial stability of these key partners.  In Europe, our automotive sales were down approximately 3% in the second quarter, reflecting pressure from COVID-19 and lockdowns in France and parts of the U.K. While our operations in Germany and the Benelux region held up fairly well through the peak of the pandemic, France and the U.K. drove an approximate 40% total sales decrease for this group in April. We had a sharp recovery from the lows of April with the reopening of France in May and the U.K. in June, which produced a surge in demand associated with deferred maintenance and repairs. As a result, total sales in Europe were positive in both months, with high single-digit comp sales growth in June.  The improving business conditions across our operations in Europe are promising. We look forward to building on the positive sales momentum and expanding our operating margin as we execute on initiatives to drive both top and bottom line in the periods ahead. We believe our current footprint in the large and fragmented European marketplace is an important competitive advantage for us. In addition, we see growth opportunities in Europe associated with the ongoing rollout of the powerful NAPA brand. This year, we have been expanding on the 5 product categories introduced in 2019 with the rollout of several new product categories including brakes, filtration, oil and steering and suspension. We are also initiating the development of our omnichannel capabilities in Europe, which will extend the digital platforms already offered in our North American and Australasian operations.  Turning to Australia and New Zealand, we are extremely proud of the exceptional performance from this team in the second quarter. Total sales were up 4.4%, driven by an approximate 2% core sales increase. With these sales and continued cost savings, this team produced a 300 basis point improvement in net profit margin. Our team achieved these results despite aggressive steps by the Australian and New Zealand government to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which generally restricted mobility and related demand for auto parts. In fact, these operations have recovered to pre-COVID sales volumes, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth and solid commercial sales growth in both May and June.  In Australia and New Zealand, retail online sales continue to grow at greater than 300% from the pre-COVID levels. And through our investment in Sparesbox and other digital capabilities, we are prepared for additional online growth in the future. The execution of key initiatives such as the rollout of the NAPA brand across our trade offering, new NAPA store openings in Australia and New Zealand, and optimized global sourcing have been important growth drivers for our commercial business. So as I said before, we are very pleased with our performance in Australasia and expect to further build on this positive momentum.  Turning now to our global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales were $1.3 billion, down 10.2% excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales in North America were down 16.7%, offset by the addition of Inenco in Australasia as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 7% to sales in the quarter. Despite the challenging industrial climate, this group produced a flat operating margin relative to 2019 and is up slightly for the first 6 months in 2020.  Looking further at Motion Industries, the slowdown in sales beginning in mid-March continued throughout the quarter, with mid-teen declines in each month. While we operated in a difficult environment, we had anticipated a lagged recovery in industries such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, pulp and paper and automotive. That played out accordingly with declines in almost every product category and in every industry sector.  Still, we saw positive trends in the second quarter. First, more of our customers are reopening their plants and returning to work, which we expect improved demand for our core industrial categories including power transmission, hydraulics and conveyance, among others.  Second, our customers are beginning to release CapEx orders that were on hold for the past several months.  Third, leading industrial indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production, pointed to improved industrial activity in June, which we expect to benefit our business in the months ahead. Additionally, the Motion team has been executing on several strategic and transformative initiatives, including the restructuring of their sales organization to optimize their customer coverage and provide for effective remote selling. This team also enhanced our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter with the rollout of a new Motion Industries website, which is expected to drive incremental sales with both existing and new customers. And as in our other businesses, there has been significant focus on aligning Motion's cost structure to drive meaningful savings and more productive operations.  In Australasia, our Inenco team is performing well, with positive total sales growth in June, driven by strong sales in the mining sector. In addition, this team continues to focus on ongoing initiatives to reduce their cost structure. Effective in August, Inenco will further integrate with our North American operations and assume the name MI Asia Pac. The team will utilize Motion's branding and new website and proprietary technology platform to enhance their digital capabilities and drive incremental volume.  Our Industrial Parts Group sells to thousands of customers, representing a diverse cross-section of industry sectors. We continue to expand our products and services in several key areas, including robotics and automation solutions and have plans to bolster our offering through a small bolt-on acquisitions before the end of 2020. So we move forward confident about capitalizing on these additional growth opportunities for our industrial operations in the quarters ahead.  So that's our business update. And now we'd like to make a few comments on our strategic planning for the future. We are excited about the recent actions to reshape our portfolio and focus solely on our automotive and industrial business segments. Both of these businesses have market-leading positions and brands in large and fragmented end markets, strong long-term industry fundamentals and steady 2% to 3% industry growth with consolidation opportunities. As we execute on our near term initiatives, we have also accelerated our strategic planning process to build on our momentum, optimize our readiness for next year and improve our post-COVID recovery rate.  Our strategic growth framework is intended to build out our global branding strategy and further leverage the NAPA and MI brands, capture more wallet share with existing customers and acquire new customers, introduce new products and services, innovate and expand on our digital offering, expand our global geographic footprint, acquire strategic businesses that complement our existing operations, and continuously enhance operational excellence and productivity. We expect to use this framework to focus our teams on driving profitable growth and delivering higher levels of free cash flow and ROIC over time.  So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol to give you a deeper look at our financials for the quarter. Carol?\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Paul. As mentioned previously, many of our comments, this morning, will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge in transaction, restructuring and other costs and income.  Total GPC sales were $3.8 billion in the second quarter, down 14.2% from 2019 or a decline of 10.1% excluding divestitures. We're pleased to report our 11th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 33.8% on a reported basis, or an adjusted 34.1% compared to 33.3% last year, up 80 basis points. The improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of divestitures as well as acquisitions of higher gross margin businesses. These items, as well as strategic category management initiatives including pricing and global sourcing actions and favorable product mix shifts, were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing environment remained stable in the second quarter from relatively high levels of inflation in 2019, which were primarily associated with tariffs in our automotive business. So with supplier price increases of 2/10 of 1% for automotive, and 0.5% for industrial thus far in 2020, the total impact of inflation on our second quarter sales was approximately 1% for both segments.  Based on the current pricing trends, we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of the year. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $971 million in the second quarter on an adjusted basis or down 13.8% from last year. This represents 25.4% of sales, which is up slightly from 25.3% last year. The decrease in operating expenses were due primarily to the positive impact of our cost actions implemented thus far in 2020.  As mentioned on our last call, our teams continue to execute on initiatives related to our $100 million cost savings plan that was announced in 2019. We're pleased to report that we're well ahead of schedule with this plan, having achieved another $40 million in cost savings in the second quarter for a total of $70 million in expense reductions through the 6 months. In addition, our teams have been executing on a number of additional initiatives to adjust our cost structure for the changes in business conditions related to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed more than $150 million in incremental savings in the second quarter.  So in total, we generated approximately $200 million in cost savings during the second quarter driven by reduced headcount and facility rationalization as well as the deferral of merit pay increases, management pay reductions, furloughs and reduced travel related to the pandemic. These savings include approximately $40 million in government subsidies received by our international operations.  Looking ahead to the third and fourth quarters, we're on track to show further progress towards our $100 million savings plan, and we expect to exceed this target for the full year. However, we also look for the accelerated cost savings related to COVID-19 to pull back as business conditions improve, sales volumes increase and government subsidies are reduced.  That said, while the sales environment remains uncertain, our focus through the second half of 2020 will be to grow our business while continuing to aggressively manage expenses and optimize our cost structure.  During the quarter, we reported several adjustments to account for a goodwill impairment charge in our European business, restructuring, transaction and COVID-19-related costs and a gain from an insurance proceeds related to a facility fire. These adjustments were $556 million in total, with $13 million accounted for in cost of goods sold and $543 million accounted for as operating and nonoperating expenses. In particular, the noncash goodwill impairment charge of $507 million resulted from the ongoing market volatility and the uncertainty in Europe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain confident in our growth strategy and the long-term industry fundamentals in Europe.  With these adjustments in mind, total operating and nonoperating expenses were an adjusted $1.05 billion for the second quarter reflecting a decrease of 12.3% from last year, comprising 27.5% of sales.  Our total segment profit in the second quarter was $328 million, down 10% on a 14% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, our total segment profit declined 6% on a 10% sales decrease, and our segment profit margin was 8.6% compared to 8.2% last year for an increase of 40 basis points.  Our tax rate for the second quarter was 24.1% on an adjusted basis and down slightly from the 24.8% in the prior period. Our net income from continuing operations in the second quarter reflected a loss of $364 million, with earnings per share a loss of $2.52. Adjusted net income was $191 million or $1.32 per share, which compares to $215 million and $1.47 per share in 2019 or a 10% decline.  So now let's discuss our second quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion, down 10% from the prior year. Segment profit of $219 million was down 4.3%, with profit margin at 8.8% compared to 8.2% margin in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement in margin primarily reflects solid operating results in our U.S., Canadian and Australasian businesses. As Paul discussed earlier, this was driven by significant cost reductions and the benefit of government subsidies in our international businesses.  Our industrial sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, a 21% decrease from Q2 of 2019. Excluding the EIS divestiture, industrial sales were down approximately 10%. Segment profit of $109 million was down 20% from a year ago or down 10%, excluding EIS, and the profit margin was flat at 8.2%. So despite the challenging sales environment throughout the quarter, our industrial teams have done an outstanding job of aligning their cost structure with the demand environment and they continue to operate well.  To complete our review of the segments, we're pleased that our July sales results reflect improving business conditions and positive momentum across the automotive and industrial businesses relative to the second quarter. For the month of July, we expect our total sales to be flat with the prior year, representing an approximate 6% sales increase for the automotive segment and a 12% sales decrease in the industrial segment.  So while these sales trends are encouraging, we continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we believe it is prudent to not reestablish our formal financial guidance at this time.  So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $1.8 billion was down 29.7% from the prior year, due in part to the sales decrease for the quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, the company entered into an agreement to sell receivables to a financial institution resulting in a $500 million decline in accounts receivable from last year and serving to further strengthen our cash position. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and are confident in our collection trends, which we continue to closely monitor in light of the current business conditions.  Our inventory at June 30 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from June of last year due to effective inventory management and reduced purchasing volume, offset by the impact of acquisitions.  Accounts payable of $3.7 billion is down 3.5% from last year due to the change in inventory and lower purchasing volumes for the quarter. At June 30, our AP-to-inventory ratio was 112%, which has improved from 110% at March 31.  Our total debt of $3.2 billion is down 17% from $3.9 billion in 2019 and has improved 11% from $3.6 billion last quarter. The cash from the sale of accounts receivable as well as the proceeds from the sale of S.P. Richards were used to pay down debt and strengthen our cash position. At June 30, we remain in compliance with our debt covenants with total debt to a trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement at 3.2x compared to 3.4x at March 31.  In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into new international credit agreements, which were made available to us increasing our total available credit capacity to $4.8 billion from $4.4 billion at March 31. As a result of these actions, we entered July with approximately $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is significantly improved from our $1.1 billion liquidity position at March 31.  Thus far, in 2020, we have generated $921 million in cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. Our free cash flow is also strong. While we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy in early April to preserve cash during the COVID-19 crisis, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in the $4.3 billion in capital deployed across 4 key areas over the last 3 years. They include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A growth net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend.  For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150 million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for further share repurchases and acquisitions other than small bolt-ons. We are prepared to adjust these plans as business conditions improve and as we gain confidence in a sustained recovery. Likewise, we will continue to support the dividend, which we have increased for 64 consecutive years.  So that's our financial update for the second quarter. And while the quarter presented many challenges, our teams did amazing work, especially on the cost structure and balance sheet side. We thank them for that, and we enter the second half of 2020 well positioned for the future.  Paul, I'll turn it back over to you.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. We made significant progress in several important areas during the quarter. Our people, portfolio positioning and operational excellence initiatives are driving results and increased confidence at GPC today. To recap the key messages outlined at the beginning of our call, our teams operated well through the challenges of COVID-19, and we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our GPC associates and customers while executing on our growth initiatives with speed and agility. Our second quarter financial performance benefited from improving sales trends in automotive, continued gross margin expansion and transformative cost actions. All of these efforts, coupled with our strong balance sheet, puts us in excellent position to continue to deliver operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow. And finally, with the steps taken to simplify and optimize our portfolio, we move forward as a more streamlined organization, focused on our automotive and industrial operations and with a well-defined strategic growth framework intended to maximize growth and value creation for all stakeholders.  So despite the economic uncertainty, future impact of COVID-19 and pace of recovery, GPC is well positioned and prepared for the various scenarios that may evolve over the near term. We look forward to executing our strategic plans into 2021 and updating you on our progress.  Thank you for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nMark Jordan: This is Mark Jordan on for Bret. It looks like the U.S. automotive business has improved from the lows, but it looks like it maybe remains pressured. And I may have missed it in the prepared remarks, but did you provide the July sales trends for the U.S.?\nPaul Donahue: Mark, this is Paul. We did talk about that, but I'll go ahead and touch on it again. Our sales right now -- and we haven't finalized July, but our sales right now in U.S. automotive are positive in the month of July.\nMark Jordan: Okay. And can you talk about maybe the gap between DIY and DIFM? And maybe when we can expect to see some more improvements in the DIFM segment? I know you mentioned it seems like some of the public sector customers are pressured.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So as we look at the quarter, Mark, our DIY business was down in April, low single digit and then turned to a positive trend in both May and June. Actually, we're up low double digits in both months, and we're seeing that even strengthen further in July. DIFM was down, I think, close to 25% in the month of April. And was down mid- to high-double digits in above May and June.  We are seeing a little bit of a bounce back as we go into July, but it's still trending down a bit. And so as we look at it, Mark, as miles driven begin to bounce back and they will, DIFM is going to bounce back with it. We still firmly believe that our market-leading position in the commercial segment is the place to be, and it best positions NAPA for long-term sustained growth.\nMark Jordan: Okay. Great. And then can you just talk about maybe some regional trends in the U.S. during the quarter? What regions were strongest and what were weakest?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, sure. So as we've seen in the past couple of quarters, the strongest regions in the quarter were out in the mountain region. So Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, probably the area that was, at that time, least impacted by COVID. The Midwest was strong, again, relatively strong compared to our -- the rest of the results.  And then the areas that were hardest hit, I don't think, Mark, will be a surprise to you, the Northeastern part of the country and then really down the Eastern seaboard. I would point out that as we look across the rest of our business, we saw good growth -- really good growth in Australia, despite the fact that New Zealand was in a full lockdown for the better part of 8 weeks. And we saw a real resurgence in Europe, again, despite the fact that both France and the U.K. were in full lockdown for a portion of the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore.\nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask if I could, on the commercial side. Paul, if you can just remind us the breakdown of the business there between, kind of, NAPA AutoCare now versus the municipal state business and then the core garages, just for a sense of the mix there. And then for some incremental color about how you saw those 3 parts of the commercial segment evolving across the course of the quarter and into July. And then I had a follow-up.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So Mike, the NAPA AutoCare program, which we have now approximately 17,000 to 18,000 members in our AutoCare program, is a key component of our commercial business as our -- the major account segment. And then you get into fleet government and the like.  As you can imagine, and as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the most challenged was our municipality fleet and government business. AutoCare was better than the fleet business. And AutoCare, of our total U.S. automotive business, is close to 20%, give or take. That business was pressured.  I would say, Mike, what we are pleased with is that we worked with our AutoCare centers as we did with many of our independent NAPA jobbers to secure PPP funding. We worked very closely with them. So those businesses are financially sound. And as miles driven begins to bounce back, again, we have no doubt that business will bounce back as well.\nMichael Montani: Great. That was -- the follow-up I had was just around the jobber performance during the quarter. So I'm wondering if you can just update us on how many jobbers you all have now versus a year ago? And then, how have their trends kind of compared to some of the U.S. trends that you called out so helpfully already?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, very consistent in terms of the performance, Mike, and -- with our NAPA jobbers. And certainly, there's outliers as we look around the country. What -- the trends that we're seeing in our -- with our NAPA jobber base is that, certainly, those NAPA jobbers who are larger, better funded, strong entrepreneurs, they're getting bigger and they're acquiring more and more stores, and they're performing just fine. In total, we have approximately 3,000 independent owners that own our 5,000 independent stores.  So the bigger owners, again, as I mentioned, we work closely with to ensure they secured PPP funding. And the majority all did and are in financial leader in good shape. And again, as we emerge from the pandemic, cars get back on the road, our jobbers are going to be just fine.\nMichael Montani: Okay. The last one I have is just around the pricing environment in the market. And there was some good commentary already there from Carol. But just wanted to understand how rational is the space, both in the U.S. and then also in Europe, where you're rolling out the private label offer?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Well, I'll give you my viewpoint. And maybe Carol wants to weigh in as well. Historically, Mike, the -- certainly here in the U.S., North America, the pricing atmosphere has been very same. We -- you generally don't see a big spike because you put brakes on sale in a given month. So we've seen, as we have through the years, a very normalized pricing atmosphere here in North America.  And it's really no different in Europe. There's a few big competitors, one who also reported this morning. And so again, the pricing atmosphere there is solid as well. Did you have anything, Carol, you'd add?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, Mike, just as a reminder, the inflation that we have had really related to the tariff back a year, 18 months ago, so we've anniversaried those tariffs. And as we go into second half, we really don't foresee at this point -- and again, there's a lot of uncertainty in the second half, we don't foresee much in the way of price increases and inflation.  Having said that, and you guys saw our 11th consecutive quarter of gross margin increases, we're really driving that through a lot of our strategic category management. And whether that's global tenders or global sourcing or pricing initiatives, that's really how we're hanging on to the gross margin improvement that we have.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Christian on for Chris. I know you mentioned the municipalities, sales in municipalities as a big differentiator versus your competitors. I'm just trying to think with -- given O'Reilly's positive DIFM commentary yesterday, what would you say is the rest of the delta to your competitors? Would it be more on the geography mix front, given you have some more stores in the Northeast was hit particularly hard? Or was it more of a market share issue?\nPaul Donahue: Well, well, we don't believe it's a market share issue. I'll just make that comment right upfront, Christian. We -- look, they had strong results, which -- congrats to the guys in green. What -- the way we look at that is it's just further indication of the opportunities that we've got for growth in the aftermarket despite the pandemic that we're all operating in, and it bodes well for us over time.  As we see what's occurred in this quarter, certainly, the surge in DIY, there's a lot of stimulus dollars out there. There's a lot of folks who have a lot of time on their hand. We still believe, as I mentioned earlier, the place to be in this -- in the automotive aftermarket is in the commercial segment, and we think that will hold up well for us in the long run.  As we look at our competition, and it's certainly in the big 4. And I'll just remind you, Christian, the big 4 represent about 35% of the industry, maybe 35% to 40%. Our model is different. We're 80% DIFM and just 20% on the DIY side. So we're a different model than what our competitors are. And I would point out that in the month of July, we are seeing our DIFM business begin to recover and come back. And we do firmly believe that as miles driven come back, that we'll continue to see improvement in our DIFM business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Makes sense. That's very helpful. And then could you also -- I don't know if you've mentioned it in the call, but could you size out the $150 million in incremental savings from initiatives, the reduced headcounts, management pay reductions for low in the rest of that group?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. So the $100 million of cost savings that we introduced last year, Q4, and we mentioned that we were on track for that, we achieved $40 million in Q2 giving us $70 million year-to-date. We'll actually be ahead of plan on that. And those are permanent cost savings, probably 75% to 80% payroll-related, related to our BRP and some other facility consolidations and we're looking at other areas as well.  The incremental in Q2 cost savings that we talked about really related to mitigating the impact of COVID-19. We put those in place, and we were pleased to see the results in the quarter. Many of those are temporary, about 60% to 65% is payroll-related. We had government subsidies in there, some freight. Of course, travel and entertainment, rent. We're working hard to see what we can make permanent. But as we said before, many of those are temporary. So delaying merit increases, some of the voluntary and involuntary furloughs, things like that. But knowing we're also looking at further structural changes. So we hope to have some of those permanent. But we do expect those to pull back in the second half. But no, we're going to be ahead of plan on the $100 million cost savings that is permanent.\nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.\nDaniel Imbro: Paul, not to beat a dead horse. But just one, as we think about the DIFM recovery for the industry and for you guys, you mentioned miles driven mounting back being the biggest driver. There's a lot of uncertainty here, but curious, given your experience, are you assuming that we get back 100% of miles driven? Or is there going to be some kind of lingering impact from work from home, less commuting, anything like that, like what do you think kind of your outlook or your -- like you guys' outlook would be for what \"normal\" looks like into 2021?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Yes, Daniel. So what the new normal looks like is anybody's guess at this point. But look, we -- as we look across the automotive aftermarket, and I look at the fundamentals that we have with the average age of the vehicle now moving up to 11.9 years, gasoline prices are down 20% year-over-year. What we see with folks that are going to be, I think, very reluctant as we've -- as -- to jump back on airplanes and travel either on business or vacation, we believe that more and more folks will be utilizing their vehicles.  So look, eventually, we do believe that we'll get back to those miles-driven numbers that we have seen and enjoyed in recent years. But it will most likely take a bit of time. But in the meantime, we're enjoying a nice -- a very nice bump in our retail business, like our competitors are. And we're very pleased with the increases we're seeing outside of the U.S. So I mentioned our business in Australia and New Zealand had just a spectacular quarter. And we've seen a real nice bounce back in Europe as well as they reopen their markets. So all in all, the fundamentals are solid. And we continue to be incredibly bullish about the automotive aftermarket.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That's helpful. That dovetails nicely, next question was going to be on Europe. I think the result is a lot better than feared there, and you mentioned a nice snap back into June. I think you said high single-digit organic growth. Can you parse out what you think is driving that level of growth? Is it just how shut down France was? There's a catch-up spend? Or are you gaining incremental market share in those markets? Kind of what's driving that higher level of growth? Because that's still a pretty heavy DIFM market. So I was surprised by that level of bounce back.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. It's incredibly heavy on the DIFM side, Daniel, you're spot on. It's 95%, basically, DIFM. Certainly, a good bit of the bounce back is pent-up demand. But what we are encouraged is that the surge that we saw in June has carried over into the month of July. And as I look at our strategy when we entered Europe 2-plus years ago, we're -- our strategy was launching private label. We're in the throes of launching NAPA, as I mentioned, across all of our markets. We've expanded our footprint into the Netherlands, which is a great market for us. We've expanded our footprint in Germany as well.  We've strengthened our management team. We've captured improved payment terms as we've leveraged our relationships with our big global suppliers. We are right on track to deliver on the cost savings that we committed to 3 years ago. And finally, what's exciting as well, Daniel, is that we're in the very early days of developing our online/omnichannel strategy for Europe. And again, we think that will bode well for us as we go forward. So we continue to be very optimistic about our position in that really fragmented market.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That's helpful. And then last one for me, moving to the industrial side. I think, Paul, you mentioned June trends, leading indicators got better. But Carol, during your remarks, I think you said we're still down 12% in July. So can you maybe help me reconcile those 2 things? It feels like you're more optimistic on the outlook, but near term, things are still pretty pressured. So when do you expect to see those indicators come through? And yes, what's kind of the outlook there for that segment?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. And I appreciate you -- I appreciate the question on industrial, Daniel. It's a really important segment for us. It's a great business that we have at Motion as well as now MI Asia Pac. And I would mention before I go to the U.S., our business in Australia and New Zealand and Southeast Asia, again despite the shutdown in New Zealand, is performing quite well, surpassing our numbers here in the U.S., and we're seeing real strength in the mining sector over in that part of the world.  Here in the U.S., what we are seeing an improved trend in July versus what we saw across Q2, we're still down, but we are seeing that trend improve. And what we believe we're going to see happen, Daniel, is that we're seeing right now, factories begin to reopen. Plants are reopening. Some of our big customers are beginning to release CapEx orders that have been on hold. We're seeing the leading indicators, PMI and industrial production showing improved numbers.  So look, industrial has lagged the automotive recovery, which we fully expected, we've seen that in the past. But we do believe that we'll see continued improvement in our numbers throughout Q3 as well as Q4 in the industrial segment as factories continue to reopen.\nOperator: And our final question will be coming from Matt McClintock with Raymond James.\nMitchell Ingles: Yes. This is Mitch Ingles, filling in for Matt. So my first question was on your digital investments. Your Sparesbox acquisition last year seems even more timely today, given the leading digital interface and CRM capabilities for the Australian automotive aftermarket. Have you been able to implement these attributes to your other auto regional businesses? Or more broadly speaking, what do you see as a driving force for your digital investments going forward?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Mitch. And I appreciate you bringing up our digital initiatives. Sparesbox, as you mentioned, was a great acquisition for us and a very timely acquisition given what's transpired with the pandemic. And in our Australian business, we've seen a 300% lift. We've been -- and what we are doing, Mitch, is utilizing the skill sets that we've acquired at Sparesbox. They're teaming up with our digital team here in North America. And ultimately, we'll be partnering with our teams in Europe to bring much of that expertise to the European market as well.  We've -- a couple of things that I would point out that we've launched. I know I talked about curb side pick up, ship to home, buy online, pick up in store. Most of the things that other businesses are doing around the world, we've also improved. And I think one of the real key factors for us is we've improved our search capabilities across all of our businesses. And we've also delivered new apps for product recommendations. So a number of factors that are leading to really solid, solid growth. And we've also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've improved and enhanced our online initiative at Motion as well. So we're very pleased. We've got a great team on the digital side, and we're very bullish on that segment as we move ahead.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nSidney Jones: We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. We thank you for your interest and support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to updating you on our third quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. As mentioned previously, many of our comments, this morning, will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge in transaction, restructuring and other costs and income.  Total GPC sales were $3.8 billion in the second quarter, down 14.2% from 2019 or a decline of 10.1% excluding divestitures. We're pleased to report our 11th consecutive increase in quarterly gross margin, which improved to 33.8% on a reported basis, or an adjusted 34.1% compared to 33.3% last year, up 80 basis points. The improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of divestitures as well as acquisitions of higher gross margin businesses. These items, as well as strategic category management initiatives including pricing and global sourcing actions and favorable product mix shifts, were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes. The pricing environment remained stable in the second quarter from relatively high levels of inflation in 2019, which were primarily associated with tariffs in our automotive business. So with supplier price increases of 2/10 of 1% for automotive, and 0.5% for industrial thus far in 2020, the total impact of inflation on our second quarter sales was approximately 1% for both segments.  Based on the current pricing trends, we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of the year. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $971 million in the second quarter on an adjusted basis or down 13.8% from last year. This represents 25.4% of sales, which is up slightly from 25.3% last year. The decrease in operating expenses were due primarily to the positive impact of our cost actions implemented thus far in 2020.  As mentioned on our last call, our teams continue to execute on initiatives related to our $100 million cost savings plan that was announced in 2019. We're pleased to report that we're well ahead of schedule with this plan, having achieved another $40 million in cost savings in the second quarter for a total of $70 million in expense reductions through the 6 months. In addition, our teams have been executing on a number of additional initiatives to adjust our cost structure for the changes in business conditions related to COVID-19. These initiatives contributed more than $150 million in incremental savings in the second quarter.  So in total, we generated approximately $200 million in cost savings during the second quarter driven by reduced headcount and facility rationalization as well as the deferral of merit pay increases, management pay reductions, furloughs and reduced travel related to the pandemic. These savings include approximately $40 million in government subsidies received by our international operations.  Looking ahead to the third and fourth quarters, we're on track to show further progress towards our $100 million savings plan, and we expect to exceed this target for the full year. However, we also look for the accelerated cost savings related to COVID-19 to pull back as business conditions improve, sales volumes increase and government subsidies are reduced.  That said, while the sales environment remains uncertain, our focus through the second half of 2020 will be to grow our business while continuing to aggressively manage expenses and optimize our cost structure.  During the quarter, we reported several adjustments to account for a goodwill impairment charge in our European business, restructuring, transaction and COVID-19-related costs and a gain from an insurance proceeds related to a facility fire. These adjustments were $556 million in total, with $13 million accounted for in cost of goods sold and $543 million accounted for as operating and nonoperating expenses. In particular, the noncash goodwill impairment charge of $507 million resulted from the ongoing market volatility and the uncertainty in Europe caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain confident in our growth strategy and the long-term industry fundamentals in Europe.  With these adjustments in mind, total operating and nonoperating expenses were an adjusted $1.05 billion for the second quarter reflecting a decrease of 12.3% from last year, comprising 27.5% of sales.  Our total segment profit in the second quarter was $328 million, down 10% on a 14% sales decrease. Excluding divestitures, our total segment profit declined 6% on a 10% sales decrease, and our segment profit margin was 8.6% compared to 8.2% last year for an increase of 40 basis points.  Our tax rate for the second quarter was 24.1% on an adjusted basis and down slightly from the 24.8% in the prior period. Our net income from continuing operations in the second quarter reflected a loss of $364 million, with earnings per share a loss of $2.52. Adjusted net income was $191 million or $1.32 per share, which compares to $215 million and $1.47 per share in 2019 or a 10% decline.  So now let's discuss our second quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion, down 10% from the prior year. Segment profit of $219 million was down 4.3%, with profit margin at 8.8% compared to 8.2% margin in the second quarter of 2019. The improvement in margin primarily reflects solid operating results in our U.S., Canadian and Australasian businesses. As Paul discussed earlier, this was driven by significant cost reductions and the benefit of government subsidies in our international businesses.  Our industrial sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, a 21% decrease from Q2 of 2019. Excluding the EIS divestiture, industrial sales were down approximately 10%. Segment profit of $109 million was down 20% from a year ago or down 10%, excluding EIS, and the profit margin was flat at 8.2%. So despite the challenging sales environment throughout the quarter, our industrial teams have done an outstanding job of aligning their cost structure with the demand environment and they continue to operate well.  To complete our review of the segments, we're pleased that our July sales results reflect improving business conditions and positive momentum across the automotive and industrial businesses relative to the second quarter. For the month of July, we expect our total sales to be flat with the prior year, representing an approximate 6% sales increase for the automotive segment and a 12% sales decrease in the industrial segment.  So while these sales trends are encouraging, we continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty and cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we believe it is prudent to not reestablish our formal financial guidance at this time.  So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $1.8 billion was down 29.7% from the prior year, due in part to the sales decrease for the quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, the company entered into an agreement to sell receivables to a financial institution resulting in a $500 million decline in accounts receivable from last year and serving to further strengthen our cash position. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables and are confident in our collection trends, which we continue to closely monitor in light of the current business conditions.  Our inventory at June 30 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from June of last year due to effective inventory management and reduced purchasing volume, offset by the impact of acquisitions.  Accounts payable of $3.7 billion is down 3.5% from last year due to the change in inventory and lower purchasing volumes for the quarter. At June 30, our AP-to-inventory ratio was 112%, which has improved from 110% at March 31.  Our total debt of $3.2 billion is down 17% from $3.9 billion in 2019 and has improved 11% from $3.6 billion last quarter. The cash from the sale of accounts receivable as well as the proceeds from the sale of S.P. Richards were used to pay down debt and strengthen our cash position. At June 30, we remain in compliance with our debt covenants with total debt to a trailing 12-month EBITDA as defined in our credit agreement at 3.2x compared to 3.4x at March 31.  In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into new international credit agreements, which were made available to us increasing our total available credit capacity to $4.8 billion from $4.4 billion at March 31. As a result of these actions, we entered July with approximately $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is significantly improved from our $1.1 billion liquidity position at March 31.  Thus far, in 2020, we have generated $921 million in cash from operations, which is up significantly from 2019. Our free cash flow is also strong. While we modified our near-term capital deployment strategy in early April to preserve cash during the COVID-19 crisis, we remain committed to several key priorities for cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. These priorities are evident in the $4.3 billion in capital deployed across 4 key areas over the last 3 years. They include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A growth net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend.  For 2020, we reduced our initial $300 million in planned capital expenditures to approximately $150 million to $200 million, and we have suspended plans for further share repurchases and acquisitions other than small bolt-ons. We are prepared to adjust these plans as business conditions improve and as we gain confidence in a sustained recovery. Likewise, we will continue to support the dividend, which we have increased for 64 consecutive years.  So that's our financial update for the second quarter. And while the quarter presented many challenges, our teams did amazing work, especially on the cost structure and balance sheet side. We thank them for that, and we enter the second half of 2020 well positioned for the future.  Paul, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes, Mike, just as a reminder, the inflation that we have had really related to the tariff back a year, 18 months ago, so we've anniversaried those tariffs. And as we go into second half, we really don't foresee at this point -- and again, there's a lot of uncertainty in the second half, we don't foresee much in the way of price increases and inflation.  Having said that, and you guys saw our 11th consecutive quarter of gross margin increases, we're really driving that through a lot of our strategic category management. And whether that's global tenders or global sourcing or pricing initiatives, that's really how we're hanging on to the gross margin improvement that we have. Yes. So the $100 million of cost savings that we introduced last year, Q4, and we mentioned that we were on track for that, we achieved $40 million in Q2 giving us $70 million year-to-date. We'll actually be ahead of plan on that. And those are permanent cost savings, probably 75% to 80% payroll-related, related to our BRP and some other facility consolidations and we're looking at other areas as well.  The incremental in Q2 cost savings that we talked about really related to mitigating the impact of COVID-19. We put those in place, and we were pleased to see the results in the quarter. Many of those are temporary, about 60% to 65% is payroll-related. We had government subsidies in there, some freight. Of course, travel and entertainment, rent. We're working hard to see what we can make permanent. But as we said before, many of those are temporary. So delaying merit increases, some of the voluntary and involuntary furloughs, things like that. But knowing we're also looking at further structural changes. So we hope to have some of those permanent. But we do expect those to pull back in the second half. But no, we're going to be ahead of plan on the $100 million cost savings that is permanent."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We hope you are staying safe and enjoying good health. So as we think about our quarterly performance and long-term focus, we want to highlight 4 key messages today. One, we are aggressively managing our company's operations through the challenges of COVID-19 by managing the short-term dynamics while staying focused on our long-term growth initiatives. This includes rigorous cost management as well as targeted investments to successfully position GPC in the recovery period and beyond.  Two, we delivered strong quarterly results amid the challenging backdrop as we executed on our transformation strategy and omnichannel initiatives. Three, with the sale of our Business Products segment and our streamlined portfolio, we are now well positioned to maximize the full potential of our automotive and industrial segments.  And four, we continue to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt and generating stronger free cash flow. We significantly enhanced our liquidity this quarter and remain in excellent position to deploy capital towards high ROIC initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world in significant ways, both in our personal lives and from a business and economic perspective. We remain focused on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers and our suppliers. We also want to extend another heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and first responders on the front lines of our fight against this outbreak for their commitment to the care and protection of our communities. We are proud of the tireless work by our associates across the global GPC family. As essential businesses, our operations have generally remained fully operational to fulfill critical customer needs, which required hard work under incredibly difficult circumstances. So a big thank you to our 50,000-plus team members for providing exceptional customer service to our partners around the globe.  Working as a team, we have executed with agility through the pandemic, quickly and effectively adopting new safety protocols to ensure a safe work environment. And as mentioned last quarter, we have stepped up our communications with our global teams and our Board to preempt and prepare for developments as much as possible. Overall, our intensified approach to managing our operations has enabled us to enhance our balance sheet flexibility, achieve meaningful cost savings and advanced operational excellence. During the quarter, we also took steps to advance our ESG initiatives, and we plan to highlight these many enhancements in our annual sustainability report to be issued later this year. Environmental, social and governance best practices are an important priority for GPC. Amid the ongoing effect of COVID-19, the S element of ESG has been paramount over the last several months, given the social unrest in our country and the world. At GPC, we have a long-standing corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion and we pledge to be part of an enduring solution to ensure equality for all.  In addition to our progress in these areas, we were pleased to announce the sale of our business products operations, S.P. Richards, on June 30. The sale of SPR represents the culmination of a multiyear strategy to optimize our portfolio and simplify our company. Over the last 3 years, we have reshaped GPC with several divestitures, including Auto Todo, EIS and now SPR and its operations in North America. All in, these divested businesses represent approximately $3 billion in annual revenues, which we have essentially exchanged for higher return investments in our automotive and industrial segments. From here, we move forward with plans to strengthen our focus on sustainable value-enhancing growth and productivity initiatives associated with our faster growing, higher-margin core businesses.  In addition, we will continue to opportunistically expand our global footprint. Our streamlined portfolio has many notable advantages, including scale and volume, the ability to leverage shared services and global branding, as well as synergies associated with common business processes, systems, suppliers and talent. As a more simplified, service-oriented distribution company, we can better maximize the value of GPC and continue to deliver strong results and long-term value.  Now moving on to our financial performance and business update. We entered the second quarter operating in a sales environment pressured by government mandates to prevent the spread of COVID. Broad shelter-in-place restrictions and full lockdowns in markets such as France and New Zealand significantly slowed mobility and overall economic activity. As announced in our May 6 earnings call, April sales were down 30% in automotive and 10% in industrial. And while the industrial segment remained pressured throughout the quarter and was down 12% in June, the automotive group had a strong recovery, down only 2% in June, led by returns to pre-COVID sales volumes in Europe and Australasia.  Total sales for the second quarter were $3.8 billion, down 10.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures, with operating margin of 8.6%, up 40 basis points, and adjusted net income at $191 million, or $1.32 per share. We also delivered improvements in working capital and strong cash flows, which Carol will cover later.  We are pleased to report a 40 basis point improvement in our segment operating profit. This was a significant accomplishment given challenging business conditions and a reflection of the strong leadership, quick decision-making and disciplined execution demonstrated throughout GPC. This approach resulted in continued gross margin expansion and significant actions to adjust our cost structure. And we are well ahead of our original cost savings target for 2020. As we move forward, we expect our teams to maintain this cost discipline and convert many of these temporary expense reductions to permanent and sustainable savings.  So now turning to a review of our business segments. The global automotive group had sales of $2.5 billion in the second quarter, down 10.1% from 2019 and representing 65% of total company revenues. As mentioned earlier, we experienced a sharp decline in sales in April, followed by a strong recovery in both May and June.  In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were down 12%, with comp sales down 13.8%. Despite the challenging top line, we were pleased to deliver a 60 basis point improvement in net operating margin. In Canada, total sales were down approximately 13%, with comp sales down 15% and net operating margin up an impressive 400 basis points. For perspective, both regions showed similar recovery trends throughout the quarter with sales improving from 25% to 30% declines in April to mid-single-digit declines in June.  For the quarter, sales to our retail customers continue to outperform through the pandemic, with positive sales growth in the U.S. and Canada. The strength in retail reflects the benefit of stimulus funds and other macro trends, as well as the positive impact of our omnichannel strategy to create an excellent in-store and online customer experience. As examples, we continue to refresh our NAPA stores, train our store associates and build on our loyalty program, while also enhancing our digital tools to grow our DIY business. Enhanced digital capabilities, such as buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, ship to home and deliver from store are driving increased traffic to our websites and record online sales in both the U.S. and Canada. We expect to benefit from this positive trend in the future through a continued expansion of our digital offering.  Commercial sales remained under pressure as lower demand from our professional shop customers led to declines in hard part categories such as brakes, chassis, ride control and exhaust. In particular, sales to accounts such as municipalities, state governments and fleets, which commonly distinguish our customer base from the competition, were especially hard hit. Overall, we believe the slowdown in commercial sales reflects the decline in miles driven related to COVID-19. However, we are optimistic that miles driven and other growth drivers will improve as consumers get back on the road for both work and personal travel.  Our North American automotive teams have also been busy executing on several transformative initiatives to streamline their organizations. These steps included changes in management structure, further DC rationalization, a sales reorganization and a continued focus on new delivery strategies and digital tools. These actions have already generated incremental cost savings and operational productivity, as evidenced by our improved operating margin in both the U.S. and Canada. We expect these efforts to continue to add value today and over the long term.  So as we mentioned in our last call, we have worked closely with our independently-owned NAPA stores and auto care customers to help them benefit from the financial aid available to small businesses, the vast majority applied for and received PPP assistance. In light of their support and current business trends, we remain confident in the lasting financial stability of these key partners.  In Europe, our automotive sales were down approximately 3% in the second quarter, reflecting pressure from COVID-19 and lockdowns in France and parts of the U.K. While our operations in Germany and the Benelux region held up fairly well through the peak of the pandemic, France and the U.K. drove an approximate 40% total sales decrease for this group in April. We had a sharp recovery from the lows of April with the reopening of France in May and the U.K. in June, which produced a surge in demand associated with deferred maintenance and repairs. As a result, total sales in Europe were positive in both months, with high single-digit comp sales growth in June.  The improving business conditions across our operations in Europe are promising. We look forward to building on the positive sales momentum and expanding our operating margin as we execute on initiatives to drive both top and bottom line in the periods ahead. We believe our current footprint in the large and fragmented European marketplace is an important competitive advantage for us. In addition, we see growth opportunities in Europe associated with the ongoing rollout of the powerful NAPA brand. This year, we have been expanding on the 5 product categories introduced in 2019 with the rollout of several new product categories including brakes, filtration, oil and steering and suspension. We are also initiating the development of our omnichannel capabilities in Europe, which will extend the digital platforms already offered in our North American and Australasian operations.  Turning to Australia and New Zealand, we are extremely proud of the exceptional performance from this team in the second quarter. Total sales were up 4.4%, driven by an approximate 2% core sales increase. With these sales and continued cost savings, this team produced a 300 basis point improvement in net profit margin. Our team achieved these results despite aggressive steps by the Australian and New Zealand government to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which generally restricted mobility and related demand for auto parts. In fact, these operations have recovered to pre-COVID sales volumes, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth and solid commercial sales growth in both May and June.  In Australia and New Zealand, retail online sales continue to grow at greater than 300% from the pre-COVID levels. And through our investment in Sparesbox and other digital capabilities, we are prepared for additional online growth in the future. The execution of key initiatives such as the rollout of the NAPA brand across our trade offering, new NAPA store openings in Australia and New Zealand, and optimized global sourcing have been important growth drivers for our commercial business. So as I said before, we are very pleased with our performance in Australasia and expect to further build on this positive momentum.  Turning now to our global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales were $1.3 billion, down 10.2% excluding the EIS divestiture. Comp sales in North America were down 16.7%, offset by the addition of Inenco in Australasia as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 7% to sales in the quarter. Despite the challenging industrial climate, this group produced a flat operating margin relative to 2019 and is up slightly for the first 6 months in 2020.  Looking further at Motion Industries, the slowdown in sales beginning in mid-March continued throughout the quarter, with mid-teen declines in each month. While we operated in a difficult environment, we had anticipated a lagged recovery in industries such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, pulp and paper and automotive. That played out accordingly with declines in almost every product category and in every industry sector.  Still, we saw positive trends in the second quarter. First, more of our customers are reopening their plants and returning to work, which we expect improved demand for our core industrial categories including power transmission, hydraulics and conveyance, among others.  Second, our customers are beginning to release CapEx orders that were on hold for the past several months.  Third, leading industrial indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production, pointed to improved industrial activity in June, which we expect to benefit our business in the months ahead. Additionally, the Motion team has been executing on several strategic and transformative initiatives, including the restructuring of their sales organization to optimize their customer coverage and provide for effective remote selling. This team also enhanced our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter with the rollout of a new Motion Industries website, which is expected to drive incremental sales with both existing and new customers. And as in our other businesses, there has been significant focus on aligning Motion's cost structure to drive meaningful savings and more productive operations.  In Australasia, our Inenco team is performing well, with positive total sales growth in June, driven by strong sales in the mining sector. In addition, this team continues to focus on ongoing initiatives to reduce their cost structure. Effective in August, Inenco will further integrate with our North American operations and assume the name MI Asia Pac. The team will utilize Motion's branding and new website and proprietary technology platform to enhance their digital capabilities and drive incremental volume.  Our Industrial Parts Group sells to thousands of customers, representing a diverse cross-section of industry sectors. We continue to expand our products and services in several key areas, including robotics and automation solutions and have plans to bolster our offering through a small bolt-on acquisitions before the end of 2020. So we move forward confident about capitalizing on these additional growth opportunities for our industrial operations in the quarters ahead.  So that's our business update. And now we'd like to make a few comments on our strategic planning for the future. We are excited about the recent actions to reshape our portfolio and focus solely on our automotive and industrial business segments. Both of these businesses have market-leading positions and brands in large and fragmented end markets, strong long-term industry fundamentals and steady 2% to 3% industry growth with consolidation opportunities. As we execute on our near term initiatives, we have also accelerated our strategic planning process to build on our momentum, optimize our readiness for next year and improve our post-COVID recovery rate.  Our strategic growth framework is intended to build out our global branding strategy and further leverage the NAPA and MI brands, capture more wallet share with existing customers and acquire new customers, introduce new products and services, innovate and expand on our digital offering, expand our global geographic footprint, acquire strategic businesses that complement our existing operations, and continuously enhance operational excellence and productivity. We expect to use this framework to focus our teams on driving profitable growth and delivering higher levels of free cash flow and ROIC over time.  So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol to give you a deeper look at our financials for the quarter. Carol? Thank you, Carol. We made significant progress in several important areas during the quarter. Our people, portfolio positioning and operational excellence initiatives are driving results and increased confidence at GPC today. To recap the key messages outlined at the beginning of our call, our teams operated well through the challenges of COVID-19, and we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our GPC associates and customers while executing on our growth initiatives with speed and agility. Our second quarter financial performance benefited from improving sales trends in automotive, continued gross margin expansion and transformative cost actions. All of these efforts, coupled with our strong balance sheet, puts us in excellent position to continue to deliver operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow. And finally, with the steps taken to simplify and optimize our portfolio, we move forward as a more streamlined organization, focused on our automotive and industrial operations and with a well-defined strategic growth framework intended to maximize growth and value creation for all stakeholders.  So despite the economic uncertainty, future impact of COVID-19 and pace of recovery, GPC is well positioned and prepared for the various scenarios that may evolve over the near term. We look forward to executing our strategic plans into 2021 and updating you on our progress.  Thank you for your interest in GPC. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Mark, this is Paul. We did talk about that, but I'll go ahead and touch on it again. Our sales right now -- and we haven't finalized July, but our sales right now in U.S. automotive are positive in the month of July. Yes. So as we look at the quarter, Mark, our DIY business was down in April, low single digit and then turned to a positive trend in both May and June. Actually, we're up low double digits in both months, and we're seeing that even strengthen further in July. DIFM was down, I think, close to 25% in the month of April. And was down mid- to high-double digits in above May and June.  We are seeing a little bit of a bounce back as we go into July, but it's still trending down a bit. And so as we look at it, Mark, as miles driven begin to bounce back and they will, DIFM is going to bounce back with it. We still firmly believe that our market-leading position in the commercial segment is the place to be, and it best positions NAPA for long-term sustained growth. Yes, sure. So as we've seen in the past couple of quarters, the strongest regions in the quarter were out in the mountain region. So Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, probably the area that was, at that time, least impacted by COVID. The Midwest was strong, again, relatively strong compared to our -- the rest of the results.  And then the areas that were hardest hit, I don't think, Mark, will be a surprise to you, the Northeastern part of the country and then really down the Eastern seaboard. I would point out that as we look across the rest of our business, we saw good growth -- really good growth in Australia, despite the fact that New Zealand was in a full lockdown for the better part of 8 weeks. And we saw a real resurgence in Europe, again, despite the fact that both France and the U.K. were in full lockdown for a portion of the quarter. Yes. So Mike, the NAPA AutoCare program, which we have now approximately 17,000 to 18,000 members in our AutoCare program, is a key component of our commercial business as our -- the major account segment. And then you get into fleet government and the like.  As you can imagine, and as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the most challenged was our municipality fleet and government business. AutoCare was better than the fleet business. And AutoCare, of our total U.S. automotive business, is close to 20%, give or take. That business was pressured.  I would say, Mike, what we are pleased with is that we worked with our AutoCare centers as we did with many of our independent NAPA jobbers to secure PPP funding. We worked very closely with them. So those businesses are financially sound. And as miles driven begins to bounce back, again, we have no doubt that business will bounce back as well. Yes, very consistent in terms of the performance, Mike, and -- with our NAPA jobbers. And certainly, there's outliers as we look around the country. What -- the trends that we're seeing in our -- with our NAPA jobber base is that, certainly, those NAPA jobbers who are larger, better funded, strong entrepreneurs, they're getting bigger and they're acquiring more and more stores, and they're performing just fine. In total, we have approximately 3,000 independent owners that own our 5,000 independent stores.  So the bigger owners, again, as I mentioned, we work closely with to ensure they secured PPP funding. And the majority all did and are in financial leader in good shape. And again, as we emerge from the pandemic, cars get back on the road, our jobbers are going to be just fine. Yes. Well, I'll give you my viewpoint. And maybe Carol wants to weigh in as well. Historically, Mike, the -- certainly here in the U.S., North America, the pricing atmosphere has been very same. We -- you generally don't see a big spike because you put brakes on sale in a given month. So we've seen, as we have through the years, a very normalized pricing atmosphere here in North America.  And it's really no different in Europe. There's a few big competitors, one who also reported this morning. And so again, the pricing atmosphere there is solid as well. Did you have anything, Carol, you'd add? Well, well, we don't believe it's a market share issue. I'll just make that comment right upfront, Christian. We -- look, they had strong results, which -- congrats to the guys in green. What -- the way we look at that is it's just further indication of the opportunities that we've got for growth in the aftermarket despite the pandemic that we're all operating in, and it bodes well for us over time.  As we see what's occurred in this quarter, certainly, the surge in DIY, there's a lot of stimulus dollars out there. There's a lot of folks who have a lot of time on their hand. We still believe, as I mentioned earlier, the place to be in this -- in the automotive aftermarket is in the commercial segment, and we think that will hold up well for us in the long run.  As we look at our competition, and it's certainly in the big 4. And I'll just remind you, Christian, the big 4 represent about 35% of the industry, maybe 35% to 40%. Our model is different. We're 80% DIFM and just 20% on the DIY side. So we're a different model than what our competitors are. And I would point out that in the month of July, we are seeing our DIFM business begin to recover and come back. And we do firmly believe that as miles driven come back, that we'll continue to see improvement in our DIFM business. Yes. Yes, Daniel. So what the new normal looks like is anybody's guess at this point. But look, we -- as we look across the automotive aftermarket, and I look at the fundamentals that we have with the average age of the vehicle now moving up to 11.9 years, gasoline prices are down 20% year-over-year. What we see with folks that are going to be, I think, very reluctant as we've -- as -- to jump back on airplanes and travel either on business or vacation, we believe that more and more folks will be utilizing their vehicles.  So look, eventually, we do believe that we'll get back to those miles-driven numbers that we have seen and enjoyed in recent years. But it will most likely take a bit of time. But in the meantime, we're enjoying a nice -- a very nice bump in our retail business, like our competitors are. And we're very pleased with the increases we're seeing outside of the U.S. So I mentioned our business in Australia and New Zealand had just a spectacular quarter. And we've seen a real nice bounce back in Europe as well as they reopen their markets. So all in all, the fundamentals are solid. And we continue to be incredibly bullish about the automotive aftermarket. Yes. It's incredibly heavy on the DIFM side, Daniel, you're spot on. It's 95%, basically, DIFM. Certainly, a good bit of the bounce back is pent-up demand. But what we are encouraged is that the surge that we saw in June has carried over into the month of July. And as I look at our strategy when we entered Europe 2-plus years ago, we're -- our strategy was launching private label. We're in the throes of launching NAPA, as I mentioned, across all of our markets. We've expanded our footprint into the Netherlands, which is a great market for us. We've expanded our footprint in Germany as well.  We've strengthened our management team. We've captured improved payment terms as we've leveraged our relationships with our big global suppliers. We are right on track to deliver on the cost savings that we committed to 3 years ago. And finally, what's exciting as well, Daniel, is that we're in the very early days of developing our online/omnichannel strategy for Europe. And again, we think that will bode well for us as we go forward. So we continue to be very optimistic about our position in that really fragmented market. Yes. And I appreciate you -- I appreciate the question on industrial, Daniel. It's a really important segment for us. It's a great business that we have at Motion as well as now MI Asia Pac. And I would mention before I go to the U.S., our business in Australia and New Zealand and Southeast Asia, again despite the shutdown in New Zealand, is performing quite well, surpassing our numbers here in the U.S., and we're seeing real strength in the mining sector over in that part of the world.  Here in the U.S., what we are seeing an improved trend in July versus what we saw across Q2, we're still down, but we are seeing that trend improve. And what we believe we're going to see happen, Daniel, is that we're seeing right now, factories begin to reopen. Plants are reopening. Some of our big customers are beginning to release CapEx orders that have been on hold. We're seeing the leading indicators, PMI and industrial production showing improved numbers.  So look, industrial has lagged the automotive recovery, which we fully expected, we've seen that in the past. But we do believe that we'll see continued improvement in our numbers throughout Q3 as well as Q4 in the industrial segment as factories continue to reopen. Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Mitch. And I appreciate you bringing up our digital initiatives. Sparesbox, as you mentioned, was a great acquisition for us and a very timely acquisition given what's transpired with the pandemic. And in our Australian business, we've seen a 300% lift. We've been -- and what we are doing, Mitch, is utilizing the skill sets that we've acquired at Sparesbox. They're teaming up with our digital team here in North America. And ultimately, we'll be partnering with our teams in Europe to bring much of that expertise to the European market as well.  We've -- a couple of things that I would point out that we've launched. I know I talked about curb side pick up, ship to home, buy online, pick up in store. Most of the things that other businesses are doing around the world, we've also improved. And I think one of the real key factors for us is we've improved our search capabilities across all of our businesses. And we've also delivered new apps for product recommendations. So a number of factors that are leading to really solid, solid growth. And we've also, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've improved and enhanced our online initiative at Motion as well. So we're very pleased. We've got a great team on the digital side, and we're very bullish on that segment as we move ahead."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSidney Jones: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2020 conference call to discuss our earnings results and COVID-19 business update. I\u2019m here with Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call and webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations website. Before we begin this morning, please be advised that this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today\u2019s call may involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company\u2019s latest SEC filings, including this morning\u2019s press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid. And welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We hope you are staying safe and enjoying good health in these challenging times, and we appreciate you joining us today for our review of this morning\u2019s release. We would like to begin today\u2019s call with a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its significant impact around the world. Our hearts go out to the millions of people affected by COVID-19, and we thank those health care providers and first responders on the front lines of our fight against this outbreak. Their commitment to the care and protection of our communities is admirable and greatly appreciated. We also owe a debt of gratitude to our associates across the global GPC family. Our team members have lived our GPC values every day and stepped up with powerful displays of commitment to each other, our customers and our communities. Working as a team, we rallied to navigate the crisis to ensure our employees stay healthy, our operations remain safe and our teams are well positioned to serve our customers\u2019 critical needs. Each of our three business segments are classified as essential businesses, and we are proud to be able to take care of our customers during these unprecedented times. Like everyone, new protocols at our facilities require us to adjust the way we conduct business. To highlight a few examples, we now make mask, sanitizer and other PPE widely available for our team mates, direct movement patterns within buildings, mandate social distancing and implement temperature checks in many of our operations. We created flexible operating policies for our associates and our customers, implemented remote work plans and develop phase attendant strategies to ensure a safe environment. Importantly, we stepped up our communication approach with our global employee base. We distribute daily and weekly updates to provide information and progress reports on our collective efforts. Our technology platforms and talented IT teams have worked hard to enable a seamless transition to our new technological reality. Despite all our new routines, our 55,000 associates remain positive, productive and connected. We are also exceptionally proud to recognize our colleagues who have been so generous to give back to our communities throughout this crisis. We have continued our support of numerous charitable organizations, including internal relief funds that support fellow GPC team mates the need and have many examples where we have donated PPE and cleaning and safety supplies to hospitals and health care centers. In addition, our employees volunteered their time to numerous worthy causes. Giving back has and always will be a core GPC value. Given the circumstances, we will start by sharing a few first quarter highlights, and then we want to turn to, one, the business environment over the past 90 days; and two, how our teams have responded. After that, I\u2019ll provide commentary on each of the business segments before handing the call over to Carol to detail the financial results. So total sales for the first quarter were $4.6 billion, up 1.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures or down approximately 3.7% on a reported basis. For perspective, sales were up over 2% through February, despite mild weather and mixed industrial end market trends. Sales in the first half of March were also strong, up approximately 4% compared to the same period the prior year. As the virus impact accelerated, we experienced an approximate 16% sales decrease during the second half of March compared to the same period the prior year. Net income in the first quarter 2020 was $137 million and earnings per share were $0.94, with adjusted net income at $133 million or $0.92 per share. We estimate an approximate 3% negative impact to net sales and a $0.21 negative impact to EPS during the first quarter 2020 contributed to COVID-19. Moving to the business environment and our response. You might recall from our February earnings call, we highlighted the strong momentum the teams were building with a solid fourth quarter in 2019 performance. We entered 2020 focused on our strategic growth, improving our operating performance and capital allocation initiatives. 2020 was poised to be an exciting year for GPC. In mid-February, when we released our 2019 results, we spoke to these plans and initiatives as well as commenting on supply chain operations in China, which, at the time, was impacted by the outbreak. As the impact of COVID-19 was more broadly felt around the globe, we began to see declines in demand in mid-March. National lockdowns in France and New Zealand followed and broad shelter in place mandates impacted our operations. This trend continued for the balance of the first quarter and throughout the month of April. In response to the crisis, we have elevated the cadence in which we are managing the business. I am proud of the coordinated and strong leadership demonstrated across the company over the past two months. Teams have stepped up, acted urgently and executed with discipline. We increased the frequency of our global leadership cadence and formed a cross-functional COVID-19 response team to accelerate decision-making, analyze rapidly-changing information and coordinate sharing best practices across the global teams. As a result, we took rapid action to address our cost structures given the new realities of sales volume and business activity. We developed a disciplined process to identify, analyze and prioritize nearly 50 enterprise cost actions. Select cost savings actions put in place include delayed merit increases, headcount reductions, voluntary and involuntary leave of absences, hiring freezes, executive and officer pay reductions, reduced bonuses and commissions, government subsidies collections, reduction in hours of operations, rent relief, professional fees and marketing expense reductions, T&E reductions and facility closures, to name just a few. We created detailed scenario models and built a refined financial forecast process to assess weekly performance and adjust action to business reality. Our teams continue to evaluate and implement cost savings measures to appropriately respond to the business conditions and are focused on maintaining cost discipline as our markets recover. We should mention that our global supply chain is operating well. Our supply chain, including foreign and domestic manufacturing capacity and logistics, is largely performing at levels seen prior to COVID-19. We believe the power of our global operating scale, product and geographic diversification of supplier partners and intense teamwork across our business units, create an advantage as we work to minimize any potential service disruption for our customers. We continue to monitor a few geographies in specific product categories such as PPE that are still returning to pre-crisis levels, but we are cautiously optimistic about the path to full recovery. We would be remiss if we did not take the opportunity to publicly thank our GPC procurement teams and our valued suppliers for their unwavering partnership and support. Now let\u2019s turn to a review of our business segments, beginning with our global automotive group. For the first quarter, this group represented 57% of total revenues and had a sales decline of 1%, excluding divestitures. In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were down 3.8% in the first quarter, with comp sales down 5.7%. Primarily, the sales decline reflects the combination of a slow start to 2020 due to the mild winter weather that pressured sales in January and February and the impact of COVID-19 in the last half of March. While sales started strong in March, up 7% through midmonth, sales fell by 24% over the final two weeks of the quarter. These headwinds drove sales declines in both the commercial and retail segments of our business. And while the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales, outperformed our DIY sales for the quarter overall. This flipped in late March with DIY showing more resilience throughout this crisis. Under the current business conditions, online orders have increased significantly and have been an important factor in driving DIY sales. Our omnichannel initiatives, such as buy online, pick up in store, curbside pickup and expanded ship-to-home capabilities, including next-day delivery to every U.S. market, allow our customers a variety of convenient options when making a purchase. In addition, this environment has prompted us to provide additional services, such as same-day store deliveries on the DIY side and touchless delivery for our commercial customers. We believe that these services will prove to enhance our customer value proposition in both the near and long term. Before leaving our U.S. automotive operations, we thought we would share an update on the financial state of our independent owners and our good AutoCare customers. As we mentioned in our April six release, our NAPA team, along with several of our financial partners, are working closely with these independently-owned businesses to help them benefit from the financial assistance available to them. This has involved continued education regarding several programs, including the Cares Act. To date, the vast majority of our independent NAPA owners have applied for PPP assistance with 60% receiving funding and expect a decline. The majority of our owners have also applied for other financial support, such as loan payment deferrals and standard SBA loans for disaster relief. Importantly, we would emphasize that none of our NAPA owners had to close their businesses due to COVID-19. In addition, among our NAPA AutoCare center customers, most of which remain open for business, more than 60% have filed for assistance with over 40% currently funded. We are confident in the financial stability of these key partners and we\u2019ll continue to work with them to ensure they pull-through these difficult times. In Canada, we also experienced mid-single digit comp sales declines, which were partially offset by acquisitions. Through February, our Canadian business was trending slightly positive. Although sales began to gradually slow in early March before falling 25% over the last half of the month, in accordance with provincial shelter in place orders. In Europe, our automotive sales were up 14%, driven by the incremental benefit from the PartsPoint and Todd acquisitions in 2019. Sales were offset by a high single digit decline in core sales, driven primarily by COVID-19 as well as the impact of foreign currency. After posting relatively flat comp through February, sales in Europe slowed significantly in early March and were especially pressured following the March 17 preemptive government lockdown in France. France is our largest market in Europe, representing approximately 39% of total European revenues. And we look forward to the easing of these restrictions later this month. In light of our earlier expectations for much improved results for Europe in 2020, the current conditions represent a temporary setback, which our team is addressing via several measures, including aggressive cost reductions. In addition, with a vast network of operations across several key regions, including France, the U.K., Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium, we continue to view our expanded footprint in a large and fragmented European marketplace as an important competitive advantage. We are committed to our growth strategy for these operations and expect this business to emerge from the pandemic well positioned to actively build on its market-leading position in the recovery. Our strongest automotive results were in Australia and New Zealand, where we posted low single-digit comp growth and operating margin expansion despite a significant negative impact from foreign currency translation. This region was the least affected by COVID-19 in March. Although New Zealand, which represents less than 20% of our Australasian automotive revenues, was also under a mandatory lockdown. As in the U.S., online sales have been strong through this crisis and a solid driver of retail sales for this region. We continue to support our customers through buy online, pick up in store, and deliver from store capabilities, utilizing the Repco store fleet of delivery vehicles in all markets. With the dramatic growth in online demand, the timeliness of the Sparesbox acquisition in 2019 has proven especially beneficial. Sparesbox is Australia\u2019s leading online automotive parts and accessories business. And we have utilized its specialized expertise to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and improve our omnichannel capabilities in Australasia and across our global automotive operations. So that\u2019s a recap of the global automotive group and our first quarter performance. The headwinds we experienced relative to COVID-19 had a significant impact on demand late in the quarter. And despite our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the aftermarket, we expect a decline in miles driven, consumer spending and overall economic activity to continue to pressure this segment over the near term. Now turning to our global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales were $1.5 billion, up 4.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. North American comp sales were down 3.1%, including an approximate 1% decline in sales due to the impact of COVID-19. This was offset by the addition of Inenco in Australasia as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 7.8% of sales. Inenco was acquired in July of 2019 and performed well in the first quarter despite the challenges of the lockdown in New Zealand as well as Southeast Asia. Looking further at Motion Industries, our North American industrial operations, the slowdown in the industrial economy over the last five to six months in 2019 was showing the early signs of a recovery in January and February. Leading indicators, such as the purchasing managers index and industrial production, pointed to a stabilizing industrial economy until March when COVID-19 presented a new set of challenges for the industry. The growing pressure on demand related to customer closures and the broad decline in economic activity over the last two weeks of March led to just two of our 14 product categories posting positive year-over-year sales gains in the first quarter. This, of course, includes our safety products category, which has benefited from the heightened demand for PPE and other safety supplies throughout the crisis. By industry sector, all 12 key groups posted year-over-year sales declines, ranging from slight decreases for the food processing and aggregate and cement sectors, to double-digit declines for equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and oil and gas. Despite the current sales environment, the Motion team operated well and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement. Thus far, in the second quarter, the economic pressure of COVID-19 has continued to impact the demand environment. With that said, we sell to thousands of customers, representing a diverse cross-section of industry sectors, which should soften the level of sales declines for this business. Likewise, we continue to expand our automation solutions capabilities and prepare for the surge in demand associated with incremental maintenance and repairs in a recovery. We are actively tracking the status of our customers\u2019 factories and seeing more customers returning to work and opening their plant. This is a positive development for the industry, which we expect to drive improved demand for our core industrial categories, including powered transmission and electrical products, hydraulics, pneumatics and conveyance, among others. Rounding out our business segment updates, the Business Products Group reported sales of $468 million, down 2.3% or up 1.5%, excluding the impact of its SPR Canada and GCN divestitures. The 1.5% sales increase reflects the positive impact of especially strong sales of jan/san and safety supplies, which we began to see in connection with the COVID-19 in early March. This category was up 28% from last year and accounted for 46% of total revenues for this business segment in the first quarter. Sales in this category have offset the declines in our core business products categories. And while we expect these trends to continue as we battle through COVID-19, we anticipate a more challenging second quarter relative to Q1. Looking beyond these near-term trends, we continue to evaluate our longer-term plans for this business. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Carol to give you a deeper look at our financials for the quarter. Carol?\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Paul. Total GPC sales were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, down 3.7% from 2019 or up 1.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures. For the quarter, we were pleased to report our tenth consecutive increase in our quarterly gross margin, with gross margin improving to 32.9% from 31.8% in 2019 or up 108 basis points. The improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of divestitures and acquisitions of higher gross margin businesses in automotive and industrial. These items as well as favorable product mix shifts were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volume. The pricing environment stabilized in the first quarter from relatively high levels of inflation in 2019, primarily associated with tariffs in automotive and Business Products. In addition to the slight carryover effect of these tariffs in the first quarter, additional supplier price changes thus far in 2020 have been flat in automotive, 0.4% in Industrial and 0.5% in office. So overall, pricing had a slightly favorable impact to sales for the quarter, and we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of 2020. Turning to our selling, administrative and other expenses. This line item was $1.23 billion in the first quarter or up 2.4% from last year. Or up an adjusted 2.7%, excluding the impact of transaction and other costs, and this represents 27% of sales on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. These operating costs were up from last year due to several factors, including the loss of leverage on our expenses related to the lower-than-expected sales volumes and the impact of divestitures and acquisitions with higher cost models. In addition, the effect of rising costs in areas such as freight and delivery, insurance, IT and cybersecurity also drove the increase. With that said, we were pleased to see improving trends in several key areas such as payroll and legal and professional expenses. Costs in these categories were down from last year, which primarily reflects the favorable impact of our $100 million in cost-saving initiatives announced last year. We expect these improving trends to continue through the balance of the year given the positive momentum of these initiatives as well as our new and accelerated cost actions that are taken in association with the COVID-19 impact. Combining the SG&A line with our other operating and non-operating expenses, total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.32 billion for the first quarter in 2020. This is an increase of 1.9% from last year or an adjusted increase of 4.6% and represents 29% of sales on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. Our total segment operating profit in the first quarter was $276 million, down 14% on a 4% sales decrease or down 10% on a 1% sales increase, excluding divestitures. Our operating profit margin was 6.1% compared to 6.8% last year. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.7%, which is a decrease from the 24.2% in the prior year and due primarily to the net effect of shifts in income mix as well as favorable valuation allowances related to the gain on the insurance proceeds for the SPR fire, offset by less favorable stock option activity. Excluding onetime transaction, restructuring and other costs and income, our adjusted tax rate, which does not benefit from the valuation allowances just discussed, was up from last year to 25.8%. Our net income in the first quarter was $137 million and earnings per share of $0.94 and compares to $160 million and earnings per share of $1.10 last year. Our adjusted net income of $133 million or $0.92 per share compares to $187 million or $1.28 per share for 2019. Now let\u2019s discuss our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, down 1.6% from the prior year or down approximately 1%, excluding Auto Todo, which we divested in March of 2019. Our operating profit of $142 million was down 21%, with operating margin of 5.5% compared to 6.8% reported margin in the first quarter of 2019. The decline in margin primarily reflects the COVID-19 headwinds in our U.S., Canadian and European businesses. This was partially offset by the improved operating margin in Australasia, which delivered another solid quarter. As we move forward, we expect to see additional pressure on sales and profitability in the near term related to COVID-19 and the expected decline in miles driven. Our Industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a 7.7% decrease from Q1 of last year or up approximately 5%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Operating profit of $114 million was down 6% from a year ago or up 5% excluding EIS. And the operating margin improved to 7.5% from the 7.4% reported last year with the increase in the margin expansion due to our core North American industrial business and the favorable impact of divestitures. For Business Products, our revenues were $468 million, down 2.3% from 2019 or up approximately 1.5%, excluding SPR Canada and GCN. Our operating profit of $20.2 million and operating margin declined slightly to 4.3% from the 4.4% reported for the first quarter last year. These results correlate to the decline in traditional office segment, offset by strong sales in the jan/san and safety category. To complete the review of our segments, we wanted to share our April daily sales results, which reflect the continued impact of COVID-19 on the overall economic environment. For the month, our total daily sales were down an estimated 25%, including approximate declines of 30% in the automotive segment, 10% in the Industrial segment and 20% in the Business Products segment. While we expect these levels of declines and the second quarter in general to represent a low point for demand across our businesses, we cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we\u2019re planning accordingly. And as Paul discussed earlier, we\u2019ll continue to implement substantial cost-saving initiatives to sustain our operations through the current business conditions. In addition, we\u2019ve modified our near-term plans for capital allocation and implemented initiatives to more effectively manage our working capital to further preserve our cash. So now turning to the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is down 1% from the prior year and compares to our 3.7% total sales decrease for the quarter. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables, and we continue to closely monitor our collection trends in light of the current business conditions. Our inventory at March 31 was $3.7 billion, flat from March of last year due to effective inventory management and reduced purchasing volumes. Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is flat from last year, which correlates to the change in inventory and the lower purchasing volumes for the quarter. At March 31, our AP to inventory ratio was 110%, and which is consistent with last year and improved from 107% at December 31. Total debt of $3.6 billion is up 6% from $3.4 billion in 2019, and we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31. In addition, we closed the first quarter with $1.1 billion in total available liquidity, and we continue to operate with $1.1 billion in available liquidity today. Additionally, we are pleased to report that we have amended our debt agreements to expand our debt covenants to a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0 times, and our scenario planning supports the continued compliance with our covenants as we move forward through the year and enter 2021. We also continue to work with our banking and other global partners for additional credit capacity and other forms of financing, including the utilization of asset-based lending and other measures. We expect to continue to work further on liquidity option in the quarters ahead, and we\u2019re confident that we have ample liquidity to withstand the uncertainty associated with COVID-19. In the first quarter, we generated $72 million in cash from operations, a 20% increase from 2019. Our history of strong cash flows, which, of course, includes the Great Recession, continues to support our priorities for the use of cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. In the 3 year period of 2017 through 2019, we deployed $4.3 billion in capital across four key areas, including the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth, net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend. And while we remain committed to these priorities over the long term, we have modified our current thinking in these areas to preserve cash as appropriate through the current business conditions. For example, we have reduced our forecast for capital expenditures to $150 million to $200 million in 2020, which is down from our previously announced plan for $300 million in spend. In addition, we have temporarily suspended any plans for acquisition and share repurchases. Combined, we believe these near-term changes in capital allocation will serve to enhance the company\u2019s cash position as we move through this downturn. Our current steps to conserve cash through cost savings, working capital initiatives and capital allocation reductions gives us confidence to continue to support the dividend, which we have increased for 64 consecutive years. Our current annual dividend of $3.16, represents a 4% increase from 2019 and is approximately 56% of our 2019 adjusted earnings, which is within our targeted payout ratio. Recently, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend payable July 1, and we remain committed to our dividend policy going forward. In these difficult times, it\u2019s especially important to thank our colleagues for their tremendous commitment to their jobs and to GPC. Our treasury, finance, IT and HR teams have all been working tirelessly to help navigate us through these uncertainties presented by COVID-19. So we\u2019d like to extend a big thank you to all of these teams, and we appreciate all their efforts. So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2020, and I will now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. We entered April well underway in our preparedness plans to protect our employees, customers and communities while also continuing to serve our customers and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Throughout the month, we were focused on the controlled execution of these plans and would highlight several key points. To date, we have been fortunate to have very few known COVID-19 cases among our 55,000 employees. A testament to the enhanced safety protocols we have implemented in our distribution centers, branches, stores and offices. Our operations are essential to our customers and remain substantially open across business segments and geographies. Our teams have been diligent and more frequent in their communications with employees and our supplier and customer partners. Our teams have been innovative in implementing new services that have proven valuable in driving sales. We have effectively realigned our capital allocation priority by reducing our capital expenditures and suspending share repurchases and M&A, while remaining committed to the dividend. And we have worked with our banks and other financial partners for additional forms of financing and amended debt covenants to provide ample liquidity through the crisis. Working together as one team, we believe the steps we are taking to stabilize our business in these unprecedented times, will position the company for strong sales and earnings growth as we exit this global pandemic. We acknowledge the unprecedented near-term challenges that we must navigate and corresponding hard work in front of us. With that said, we remain optimistic about the future as we\u2019ve had significant learnings from the current business conditions. And the industry fundamentals across our automotive and industrial operations are strong and supportive of sustained long-term growth. The circumstances of COVID-19 have required us to assess and build on our existing capabilities. And in addition to our immediate crisis response actions, each business team has developed strategic recovery plans, that detail strategic investment and productivity priorities that we believe will accelerate our momentum following the crisis. We have also accelerated the urgency and traction of various transformation initiatives that were in process while identifying others as well. This has led us to consider actions to further optimize our portfolio, such as exiting underperforming operations and improve our operational profitability, such as with our cost savings initiatives. Additionally, we discovered new and better ways of serving our customers and managing our business. Refined approaches to order fulfillment and logistics, field and functional staffing models, digital sales and marketing programs are just a few examples. The time to market of these efforts has been dramatically reduced as well. Change is difficult for any organization, but the crisis has shown our teams, we can move with discipline and urgency to make a positive difference. So in closing, while we are focused on what we can control, we do believe the long-term industry fundamentals remain favorable across our business segments. Importantly, each of our businesses compete in very large and fragmented markets. In automotive, low fuel prices, the dramatic reduction in new vehicle production, shift in travel preferences, shift in personal versus public transportation behavior, potential deferrals of new car purchases and expectations for miles driven to ultimately recover and grow over the long term are all positive tailwinds for the industry. In Industrial, our broad and diverse customer base, change in philosophies on global manufacturing and the growing demand for plant automation solutions all remain positive long-term trends. Through prior downturns, we have generated significant cash flows despite difficult sales environment, and our end markets and business model have proven resilient. The strength of our operating model and cash flow profile over the years support our consistent track record of increasing the dividend for 64 consecutive years. Moving forward, we will remain focused on taking care of our people, our customers and our communities. We will also combine urgent immediate action with activities that will position us for the future. We are incredibly proud of the hard work of our global teams. So thank you for listening. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you. So for the auto business, in the countries where you operate, that have started to see a slowdown of new cases of COVID-19 and have started to open back up maybe a few weeks ahead of where we are in the U.S., has there been a significant rebound in auto part sales or is it pretty gradual?\nPaul Donahue: Liz, great question. We had a couple hour conference call with our European leadership team yesterday. And our markets where we have seen openings, i.e., in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, we are definitely seeing a resurgence in our sales top line. Those markets, they fared better than certainly our market in France and the U.K. France has been in lockdown for the longest period of time out of our markets, the U.K. locked down in late March. So those two have been dramatically impacted. We\u2019ll see France. What we hope, France will begin gradual reopening on May 11. We think U.K. will probably be later in May. But directly to your question, Liz, we are seeing an uptick, a nice uptick in sales in both Germany and the Netherlands.\nLiz Suzuki: And do you think there could be a shift in consumer behavior? And maybe it\u2019s already happening in those countries that are recovering, where commuting and vacation travel starts shifting more to the automobile as opposed to public transportation or air travel?\nPaul Donahue: Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Liz, look, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess at this point. But we would certainly expect in the near-term that we will see folks gravitating to more driving, more utilization of their automobile versus jumping back on airplanes. So I would think we\u2019ll see that in all our markets, AsiaPac, Europe as well as across North America.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Liz.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nPaul Donahue: Morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Questions around the balance sheet, I guess, given the AP to inventory at 110 and likely higher leverage ratios just on the near-term lower EBIT. Is that something that you have to be concerned about the payables programs being at such high levels, given a higher leverage ratio with those lenders?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, Bret, when we think about our working capital, we are still quite comfortable with where we are with our supply chain financing, our accounts payable programs and all of our programs with our suppliers. Quite honestly, as Paul mentioned, we\u2019ve had just a terrific working relationship with our procurement teams and our suppliers. And we\u2019re still making further progress on extended terms globally across our businesses, even in these times. When we think about our leverage and the metrics that you mentioned, we\u2019re comfortable with other levers we\u2019re pulling. So we mentioned some of the things we\u2019re doing in capital allocation, be it CapEx or be it our M&A or share repurchase, all levers we can pull quite easily. We also have some other working capital metrics we\u2019re looking at and making progress on. So in the area of inventory management, and then keeping just a tight eye on AR. So no, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are, and we expect to hold on to that ratio as we move ahead and to still get working capital improvement.\nBret Jordan: And I guess, you mentioned participating maybe some asset-based lending is - what are your plans around the balance sheet as far as for the liquidity?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. So no, great question. As we did our modeling and worked with our banking and financial partners and did increase our covenant through the end of this year. And we\u2019re quite comfortable that we\u2019ll remain in compliance with that covenant without these other options. Again, with the capital allocation levers we pulled and some of our working capital improvement, we believe we\u2019ll be in compliance without doing other asset-based lending. But having said that, our treasury teams work continuously looking at many different options and whether it\u2019s an AR securitization or some real estate structure type transaction or quite honestly, we\u2019re also pursuing some international loans that are being made available in some of the geographies we have in Europe that\u2019s attractive financing. So we honestly believe we can be in compliance without doing those things, but we\u2019re being prudent to continue to model and look at what may make sense as we move ahead during what will be probably the toughest quarter from a balance sheet standpoint in Q2.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. And then one macro auto question. You said that none of the NAPA U.S. independents had closed their doors. Do you see this event sort of driving some contraction in the total number of doors, whether it be other independent buying group members? But do you see this sort of being shocking enough that we\u2019re going to shrink the total number of stores in the auto parts space?\nPaul Donahue: Well, Bret, it certainly is possible. We - I don\u2019t know that the automotive aftermarket is going to be that significantly different from other small businesses that have been impacted. I will tell you that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our - many of our independent owners have already taken part in the PPP and are financially strong as well as many of our NAPA AutoCare centers, as well, have taken advantage. So we think that, if anything, Bret, there perhaps may be some acquisition opportunities down the road for a company like ours with as strong a balance sheet as we continue to maintain.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Thank you, Bret.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nGustavo Gonzalez: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot. Thanks for taking our questions. So your comments suggest that kind of trend deteriorated further in April versus March. And I know it\u2019s a limited data set, but the cadence in April stayed sort of relatively flat in all segments? Or did it improve or get worse from there sort of as the month progressed?\nPaul Donahue: Okay. So I\u2019ll take a shot at that. What we saw in the month of April is sequential improvement throughout the month that has now carried over into May. So really, what we saw here in the U.S. is as states reopened, we saw our business ramp back up. We expect to see the same in Europe, as I mentioned earlier, as we\u2019ve already seen in Germany and the Netherlands. We certainly expect that in Asia Pac as well. And as France comes back online, the U.K., we fully expect to see our business ramp back up. In Asia Pacific, we - New Zealand was in a total lockdown mode. That country is now reopening, and we\u2019ve seen a resurgence in business, both in automotive and Industrial.\nGustavo Gonzalez: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then one more for me. So the declines in auto, the cadence has seen your end, your own stores and kind of what you\u2019re seeing with your wholesale sales to your independents. How different is that? Is there any delta you guys are seeing there? And then I know you guys said no closures on the impendent front currently, but how solvent with the current sales volumes do you think they can kind of last 20%, 30% down in sales?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. So let me take the first question first. So between our company stores and our independent-owned stores, the numbers and trends were very similar, so not a big discrepancy between those two. What I would say and I\u2019ll repeat what I said earlier, I believe the number that I\u2019ve seen most recently is 60% of our independent owners have successfully applied for PPP funds. So to this point, our independent owners are in good shape. I believe over 90% have applied. And as you know, it\u2019s the banking system. Some of the applications have moved a bit slower, but we do believe that the program that the Fed has put out will benefit. And as it\u2019s designed to, should benefit small independent-owned businesses, like our good NAPA independent-owned stores as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. So we think in the long haul, our group will be just fine.\nGustavo Gonzalez: Got it. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Bellinger: Great. Thank you. And I hope everyone is staying safe. Just following up on the U.S. auto business and the sequential improvement, you mentioned week to week. How are you thinking about the stimulus checks and the flow to consumers? How big of a factor was that to help the improvement? And can you talk about any regional differences that have stood out lately or a certain subset of stores that are performing better or worse than the overall automotive average?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, David. Welcome. We\u2019re happy to have you on our account. I\u2019ll tackle the second question first in terms of regional differences, probably no surprise where we have seen the most pressure from a regional standpoint is in the Northeast. So our good owners and company stores in and around New York, Boston, have really been challenged, again, should not be a surprise. The Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. was pressured as well. On the flip side, our business has maintained relatively well in the Midwest as well as the Mountain area, which - those two regions of the country also had good fourth quarters as well. So we appreciate the great job our leadership teams are doing in both those markets. In terms of the stimulus checks, we would think that it can only be a positive. It\u2019s hard to track, David, exactly to pinpoint if we\u2019ve seen a lift week to week as a result of stimulus checks, but we have to believe that\u2019s a positive. I would also mention that - and as I did in my prepared remarks, we have seen a big uptick in our online and digital business, all across the GPC businesses. So again, the stimulus checks can only benefit our business in the long haul.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Then just following up on the strong online sales you just mentioned to the DIY customers. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing there? Maybe give us a sense of magnitude of how much that channel has picked up. And could this become a more substantial piece of the business going forward?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, great question. And look, we\u2019ve been investing in our online efforts both here in the U.S. as well as Australia. You might remember, David, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we did an acquisition in Australia last year of the leading online purveyor of auto parts, a company called Sparesbox, very timely acquisition for us. They brought a tremendous level of expertise and knowledge around all things digital, but also great automotive knowledge as well. So our business in Australia is up three times here over the last couple of months. Our business in the U.S. is up two times. Now granted, it is a fairly small base that we\u2019re coming off of. But we\u2019re thrilled with what we\u2019re seeing, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our digital efforts across all of our businesses.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. Thank you very much.\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I had a question for Carol and then Paul. Carol, could you help us understand the - what you think the variable margin is the business now? Is it - can we still use something like 25% or 30%, as things come under pressure? And is that still a good number? Or does that come back out? And then, Paul, I guess, really thinking about those trends you talked about, how much stronger was DIY than do it for me? Was it possible that it\u2019s actually up in April? And also in Industrial, if you could answer what the trends have been there since the second half of March and now into May, if it\u2019s accelerating or still decelerating?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, okay. I\u2019ll let Carol tackle the first question.\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. So Greg, you\u2019re still correct on the 25% to 30% on the variable, and that is still a correct assumption. And when you mentioned, just a comment on the Industrial, as we mentioned, what April sales were for the Industrial business. So we - as Paul mentioned, each one of our businesses were better second half of April than they were first half of April, and that applies to the Industrial business as well. So the number that we gave for April would be Motion and Inenco together, Motion being a bit more down than what we gave you on the total reported number for April. But know that markedly different between the second half of April and the first half of April. And as Paul mentioned, that sort of continues into May. We had a good report from our industrial business as they\u2019ve seen plants start to reopening, and they\u2019ve seen this gradual economic reopening across the states and across a lot of these plants. And again, we saw that in our late April results for the industrial business.\nPaul Donahue: And Greg, related to your DIY versus DIFM, as mentioned. DIFM, for us, outpaced DIY in the first quarter. We did see that flip in April, as I\u2019m sure most did as states locked down. That said, I would tell you that our DIY business was still slightly down in April, although it did outpace DIFM.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Thanks and good luck, guys.\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nCarol Yancey: Morning.\nChris Horvers: So a question on the - one follow-up question on regionality. How did the South perform like Florida, Texas? Those areas were less impacted, it seems, by the virus. So how did that perform in U.S. NAPA? And then my follow-up is you have the $100 million cost program. How much of that flowed through in the first quarter? And any comments on how that sort of might rollout and benefit the business over the rest of the year. And with the new cost-out program, can you put some numbers around that in terms of how substantial that could be?\nPaul Donahue: Okay. I\u2019ll tackle the regionality question, Chris, and I\u2019ll let Carol address the cost downs. Across the southern half of the U.S., our business was about in line with our overall business, certainly better than what we experienced in the Northeast, but not as good as what we saw in parts of the Midwest and the Mountain. So kind of in the middle of the pack. I think that\u2019s partially, Chris, it\u2019s probably fairly unique to our business. We have a large segment of business that\u2019s down in the islands and the Caribbean. Those stores are big volume stores, those stores all locked down early in the pandemic, and that\u2019s certainly swung, I think, a bit of the trend for us in the southern part of the U.S., but middle of the pack. And then I\u2019ll let Carol tackle some of the cost reduction question.\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, Chris, great question. We are on track. The $100 million of cost savings, that was largely related to as we talked about a voluntary retirement plan that was put in place at the end of last year, and we actually have tracked that. We know that a lot of those actions on and those reductions were coming out after Q1. And so we are on track with the $100 million cost savings. The accelerated actions that Paul talked about, and that\u2019s across all of our global businesses, it\u2019s 50 to 60 actions, and we listed out quite a few of those for you. We\u2019re not going to get into quantifying what they are, but know that, that is on top of the $100 million, and you\u2019re talking about some significant numbers as we look ahead that will help us as we get into what will be the toughest quarter. One favorable thing that we saw, and we called it out in our prepared remarks, for the first time in many quarters, our payroll was actually down in Q1, down slightly, excluding the impact of our acquisitions and divestitures. That\u2019s directly related to the $100 million of cost savings, the VRP actions that we took. And we - again, we haven\u2019t seen that in some time. We had reductions in legal and professional for, again, the first time in Q1. The other categories, big categories for us, such as freight and delivery and rent and facilities and IT and insurance. While those categories were up, they were not up as much as they were in the prior year. And so again, we had some improving trends in SG&A, but we had such a significant deleverage in the last part of March. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the steps with the accelerated actions.\nChris Horvers: Thanks, understood. And then as a follow-up, you talked about DIY was still slightly down in the U.S. in April, and that trends improved throughout the month. It seems like these stimulus checks really picked up the DIY side of the business. So did DIY flip to the positive as we progressed into the end of April? And did you see any improvement on the commercial side over the month as well?\nPaul Donahue: Well, as we said earlier, Chris, we saw our business trend up the entire month. So week to week to week. And including now into the first week in May, we\u2019ve seen our business improve. That said, our DIY business, I think your specific question, did it trend positive? It did not because we still had a significant decline in our footsteps into our stores, which, I guess, should not be surprised given how many cities and states were in total lockdown. There weren\u2019t a lot of folks out of shopping, unfortunately. Hence, the nice lift we saw in our digital and online business.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much and best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Chris.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Seth, is your line muted?\nPaul Donahue: Okay. I guess we lost that.\nOperator: Yes. Our final question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for squeezing me in here late.\nCarol Yancey: Morning.\nDaniel Imbro: Paul, apologies if I missed this, but maybe just to clarify. Where did total organic growth shake out to for Europe? I don\u2019t - I didn\u2019t see a total number. I know you mentioned the geographies. But do you have that on hand?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. So the organic growth for Q1 was down high single digits. And we had some acquisitions that were in there that related to the reported number being up 10%. And obviously, currency was a big impact in the quarter as well at a down 3%. So high single-digit down comps for March.\nPaul Donahue: And Daniel, we should mention, and you all know this, but certainly, Europe was hit much earlier with the pandemic than certainly North America. If there\u2019s any good news to report, as we spoke to our teams yesterday, we do believe the worst in Europe is now behind us. We have peaked out. And again, we are now making plans to reopen in France and the U.K. We\u2019ve already reopened and are doing well in Germany and the Netherlands. So the good news is the worst is behind us. The peak, we\u2019ve crossed the peak, and we have better days in front of us in Europe.\nDaniel Imbro: That\u2019s great. And yes, hopefully, we\u2019ll play out here, too. And then just a follow-up. So really helpful color earlier on the independents and the health of those. But if I recall, one of your plans this year for comp drivers was kind of rolling out the remodel programs across the independent chain. And the capital for that, I think, is fronted by the independent. So any update or color you can share on the pace of what we should expect for that initiative? How the independents are maybe pushing back on that? Any kind of update on how we stand on the remodel program?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. And Daniel, it\u2019s a good question. And look, that initiative is still high on our priority list. I would tell you with what we\u2019re faced with and what our independent owners are faced with right now. We have put that essentially on hold. There are a few projects going here and there. But the large-scale rollout we have essentially put on hold, but it\u2019s temporary. And my hope will be that we see that ramp back up in the second half of the year.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Okay. Thanks, Daniel.\nOperator: We do have Seth back on the line. Well, Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nNathan Friedman: Yeah, hi. This is Nathan Friedman on for Seth. Apologies for that earlier. First question is on - regarding your April sales trends. You noted that they were down 30%. Is there any sort of differences between U.S. and Europe versus the rest - versus the chain? Any color there would be appreciated.\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. The 30% for the automotive, it ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 40%, 20% being Australia, Europe being more in the 40%. Canada being a little bit - Canada is similar to the 30%, U.S. being around 25%. Now that\u2019s the blended month. So in all of our geographies, as we\u2019ve mentioned previously, if the blended number is 30%, that is down something greater than 30%, the first two weeks and down something less than 30%, the second two weeks.\nNathan Friedman: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Helpful color. And then my second question is just on the auto operating margins. Can you speak to any sort of year-over-year differences or the rate of declines in the U.S. and Europe versus I guess, the positive change that you reported in Australasia?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. So our Australasian business in Q1, they actually had favorable comps in the quarter, and they had slight margin improvement at about 20 bps. We mentioned that was the positive bright spot. They operated really well. As we mentioned previously, North American and our Europe business, with the decline in their core sales, primarily in late March related to COVID-19, about half of the automotive margin decline is Europe and about half is North America auto, and that would all be SG&A leverage. And really, again, related to the $140 million or so of sales decline related to COVID-19. Having said that, they held their gross profit dollars. Their dollars were down proportionately, but they held the gross margin and actually had slight improvement. So all a loss of leverage related to the declines in Europe and North America.\nNathan Friedman: Great. Appreciate the color and best of luck going forward.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s earnings call. We appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to updating you in the future. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Total GPC sales were $4.6 billion in the first quarter, down 3.7% from 2019 or up 1.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures. For the quarter, we were pleased to report our tenth consecutive increase in our quarterly gross margin, with gross margin improving to 32.9% from 31.8% in 2019 or up 108 basis points. The improvement primarily reflects the favorable impact of divestitures and acquisitions of higher gross margin businesses in automotive and industrial. These items as well as favorable product mix shifts were partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volume. The pricing environment stabilized in the first quarter from relatively high levels of inflation in 2019, primarily associated with tariffs in automotive and Business Products. In addition to the slight carryover effect of these tariffs in the first quarter, additional supplier price changes thus far in 2020 have been flat in automotive, 0.4% in Industrial and 0.5% in office. So overall, pricing had a slightly favorable impact to sales for the quarter, and we expect only minor price inflation through the balance of 2020. Turning to our selling, administrative and other expenses. This line item was $1.23 billion in the first quarter or up 2.4% from last year. Or up an adjusted 2.7%, excluding the impact of transaction and other costs, and this represents 27% of sales on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. These operating costs were up from last year due to several factors, including the loss of leverage on our expenses related to the lower-than-expected sales volumes and the impact of divestitures and acquisitions with higher cost models. In addition, the effect of rising costs in areas such as freight and delivery, insurance, IT and cybersecurity also drove the increase. With that said, we were pleased to see improving trends in several key areas such as payroll and legal and professional expenses. Costs in these categories were down from last year, which primarily reflects the favorable impact of our $100 million in cost-saving initiatives announced last year. We expect these improving trends to continue through the balance of the year given the positive momentum of these initiatives as well as our new and accelerated cost actions that are taken in association with the COVID-19 impact. Combining the SG&A line with our other operating and non-operating expenses, total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.32 billion for the first quarter in 2020. This is an increase of 1.9% from last year or an adjusted increase of 4.6% and represents 29% of sales on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. Our total segment operating profit in the first quarter was $276 million, down 14% on a 4% sales decrease or down 10% on a 1% sales increase, excluding divestitures. Our operating profit margin was 6.1% compared to 6.8% last year. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.7%, which is a decrease from the 24.2% in the prior year and due primarily to the net effect of shifts in income mix as well as favorable valuation allowances related to the gain on the insurance proceeds for the SPR fire, offset by less favorable stock option activity. Excluding onetime transaction, restructuring and other costs and income, our adjusted tax rate, which does not benefit from the valuation allowances just discussed, was up from last year to 25.8%. Our net income in the first quarter was $137 million and earnings per share of $0.94 and compares to $160 million and earnings per share of $1.10 last year. Our adjusted net income of $133 million or $0.92 per share compares to $187 million or $1.28 per share for 2019. Now let's discuss our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion, down 1.6% from the prior year or down approximately 1%, excluding Auto Todo, which we divested in March of 2019. Our operating profit of $142 million was down 21%, with operating margin of 5.5% compared to 6.8% reported margin in the first quarter of 2019. The decline in margin primarily reflects the COVID-19 headwinds in our U.S., Canadian and European businesses. This was partially offset by the improved operating margin in Australasia, which delivered another solid quarter. As we move forward, we expect to see additional pressure on sales and profitability in the near term related to COVID-19 and the expected decline in miles driven. Our Industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, a 7.7% decrease from Q1 of last year or up approximately 5%, excluding the EIS divestiture. Operating profit of $114 million was down 6% from a year ago or up 5% excluding EIS. And the operating margin improved to 7.5% from the 7.4% reported last year with the increase in the margin expansion due to our core North American industrial business and the favorable impact of divestitures. For Business Products, our revenues were $468 million, down 2.3% from 2019 or up approximately 1.5%, excluding SPR Canada and GCN. Our operating profit of $20.2 million and operating margin declined slightly to 4.3% from the 4.4% reported for the first quarter last year. These results correlate to the decline in traditional office segment, offset by strong sales in the jan/san and safety category. To complete the review of our segments, we wanted to share our April daily sales results, which reflect the continued impact of COVID-19 on the overall economic environment. For the month, our total daily sales were down an estimated 25%, including approximate declines of 30% in the automotive segment, 10% in the Industrial segment and 20% in the Business Products segment. While we expect these levels of declines and the second quarter in general to represent a low point for demand across our businesses, we cannot reasonably forecast the full impact of COVID-19 in the coming months. As a result, we're planning accordingly. And as Paul discussed earlier, we'll continue to implement substantial cost-saving initiatives to sustain our operations through the current business conditions. In addition, we've modified our near-term plans for capital allocation and implemented initiatives to more effectively manage our working capital to further preserve our cash. So now turning to the balance sheet. Our accounts receivable of $2.7 billion is down 1% from the prior year and compares to our 3.7% total sales decrease for the quarter. We remain pleased with the quality of our receivables, and we continue to closely monitor our collection trends in light of the current business conditions. Our inventory at March 31 was $3.7 billion, flat from March of last year due to effective inventory management and reduced purchasing volumes. Our accounts payable of $4.1 billion is flat from last year, which correlates to the change in inventory and the lower purchasing volumes for the quarter. At March 31, our AP to inventory ratio was 110%, and which is consistent with last year and improved from 107% at December 31. Total debt of $3.6 billion is up 6% from $3.4 billion in 2019, and we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31. In addition, we closed the first quarter with $1.1 billion in total available liquidity, and we continue to operate with $1.1 billion in available liquidity today. Additionally, we are pleased to report that we have amended our debt agreements to expand our debt covenants to a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.0 times, and our scenario planning supports the continued compliance with our covenants as we move forward through the year and enter 2021. We also continue to work with our banking and other global partners for additional credit capacity and other forms of financing, including the utilization of asset-based lending and other measures. We expect to continue to work further on liquidity option in the quarters ahead, and we're confident that we have ample liquidity to withstand the uncertainty associated with COVID-19. In the first quarter, we generated $72 million in cash from operations, a 20% increase from 2019. Our history of strong cash flows, which, of course, includes the Great Recession, continues to support our priorities for the use of cash, which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value. In the 3 year period of 2017 through 2019, we deployed $4.3 billion in capital across four key areas, including the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A growth, net of divestitures, share repurchases and the dividend. And while we remain committed to these priorities over the long term, we have modified our current thinking in these areas to preserve cash as appropriate through the current business conditions. For example, we have reduced our forecast for capital expenditures to $150 million to $200 million in 2020, which is down from our previously announced plan for $300 million in spend. In addition, we have temporarily suspended any plans for acquisition and share repurchases. Combined, we believe these near-term changes in capital allocation will serve to enhance the company's cash position as we move through this downturn. Our current steps to conserve cash through cost savings, working capital initiatives and capital allocation reductions gives us confidence to continue to support the dividend, which we have increased for 64 consecutive years. Our current annual dividend of $3.16, represents a 4% increase from 2019 and is approximately 56% of our 2019 adjusted earnings, which is within our targeted payout ratio. Recently, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend payable July 1, and we remain committed to our dividend policy going forward. In these difficult times, it's especially important to thank our colleagues for their tremendous commitment to their jobs and to GPC. Our treasury, finance, IT and HR teams have all been working tirelessly to help navigate us through these uncertainties presented by COVID-19. So we'd like to extend a big thank you to all of these teams, and we appreciate all their efforts. So that concludes our financial update for the first quarter of 2020, and I will now turn it back over to Paul. Yeah, Bret, when we think about our working capital, we are still quite comfortable with where we are with our supply chain financing, our accounts payable programs and all of our programs with our suppliers. Quite honestly, as Paul mentioned, we've had just a terrific working relationship with our procurement teams and our suppliers. And we're still making further progress on extended terms globally across our businesses, even in these times. When we think about our leverage and the metrics that you mentioned, we're comfortable with other levers we're pulling. So we mentioned some of the things we're doing in capital allocation, be it CapEx or be it our M&A or share repurchase, all levers we can pull quite easily. We also have some other working capital metrics we're looking at and making progress on. So in the area of inventory management, and then keeping just a tight eye on AR. So no, we're very comfortable with where we are, and we expect to hold on to that ratio as we move ahead and to still get working capital improvement. Yeah. So no, great question. As we did our modeling and worked with our banking and financial partners and did increase our covenant through the end of this year. And we're quite comfortable that we'll remain in compliance with that covenant without these other options. Again, with the capital allocation levers we pulled and some of our working capital improvement, we believe we'll be in compliance without doing other asset-based lending. But having said that, our treasury teams work continuously looking at many different options and whether it's an AR securitization or some real estate structure type transaction or quite honestly, we're also pursuing some international loans that are being made available in some of the geographies we have in Europe that's attractive financing. So we honestly believe we can be in compliance without doing those things, but we're being prudent to continue to model and look at what may make sense as we move ahead during what will be probably the toughest quarter from a balance sheet standpoint in Q2. Yeah. So Greg, you're still correct on the 25% to 30% on the variable, and that is still a correct assumption. And when you mentioned, just a comment on the Industrial, as we mentioned, what April sales were for the Industrial business. So we - as Paul mentioned, each one of our businesses were better second half of April than they were first half of April, and that applies to the Industrial business as well. So the number that we gave for April would be Motion and Inenco together, Motion being a bit more down than what we gave you on the total reported number for April. But know that markedly different between the second half of April and the first half of April. And as Paul mentioned, that sort of continues into May. We had a good report from our industrial business as they've seen plants start to reopening, and they've seen this gradual economic reopening across the states and across a lot of these plants. And again, we saw that in our late April results for the industrial business. Morning. Yeah, Chris, great question. We are on track. The $100 million of cost savings, that was largely related to as we talked about a voluntary retirement plan that was put in place at the end of last year, and we actually have tracked that. We know that a lot of those actions on and those reductions were coming out after Q1. And so we are on track with the $100 million cost savings. The accelerated actions that Paul talked about, and that's across all of our global businesses, it's 50 to 60 actions, and we listed out quite a few of those for you. We're not going to get into quantifying what they are, but know that, that is on top of the $100 million, and you're talking about some significant numbers as we look ahead that will help us as we get into what will be the toughest quarter. One favorable thing that we saw, and we called it out in our prepared remarks, for the first time in many quarters, our payroll was actually down in Q1, down slightly, excluding the impact of our acquisitions and divestitures. That's directly related to the $100 million of cost savings, the VRP actions that we took. And we - again, we haven't seen that in some time. We had reductions in legal and professional for, again, the first time in Q1. The other categories, big categories for us, such as freight and delivery and rent and facilities and IT and insurance. While those categories were up, they were not up as much as they were in the prior year. And so again, we had some improving trends in SG&A, but we had such a significant deleverage in the last part of March. That's why we've taken the steps with the accelerated actions. Thank you. Morning. Yeah. So the organic growth for Q1 was down high single digits. And we had some acquisitions that were in there that related to the reported number being up 10%. And obviously, currency was a big impact in the quarter as well at a down 3%. So high single-digit down comps for March. Yeah. The 30% for the automotive, it ranges from a low of 20% to a high of 40%, 20% being Australia, Europe being more in the 40%. Canada being a little bit - Canada is similar to the 30%, U.S. being around 25%. Now that's the blended month. So in all of our geographies, as we've mentioned previously, if the blended number is 30%, that is down something greater than 30%, the first two weeks and down something less than 30%, the second two weeks. Yes. So our Australasian business in Q1, they actually had favorable comps in the quarter, and they had slight margin improvement at about 20 bps. We mentioned that was the positive bright spot. They operated really well. As we mentioned previously, North American and our Europe business, with the decline in their core sales, primarily in late March related to COVID-19, about half of the automotive margin decline is Europe and about half is North America auto, and that would all be SG&A leverage. And really, again, related to the $140 million or so of sales decline related to COVID-19. Having said that, they held their gross profit dollars. Their dollars were down proportionately, but they held the gross margin and actually had slight improvement. So all a loss of leverage related to the declines in Europe and North America. Thank you. We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. We appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company. And we look forward to updating you in the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid. And welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We hope you are staying safe and enjoying good health in these challenging times, and we appreciate you joining us today for our review of this morning's release. We would like to begin today's call with a few comments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its significant impact around the world. Our hearts go out to the millions of people affected by COVID-19, and we thank those health care providers and first responders on the front lines of our fight against this outbreak. Their commitment to the care and protection of our communities is admirable and greatly appreciated. We also owe a debt of gratitude to our associates across the global GPC family. Our team members have lived our GPC values every day and stepped up with powerful displays of commitment to each other, our customers and our communities. Working as a team, we rallied to navigate the crisis to ensure our employees stay healthy, our operations remain safe and our teams are well positioned to serve our customers' critical needs. Each of our three business segments are classified as essential businesses, and we are proud to be able to take care of our customers during these unprecedented times. Like everyone, new protocols at our facilities require us to adjust the way we conduct business. To highlight a few examples, we now make mask, sanitizer and other PPE widely available for our team mates, direct movement patterns within buildings, mandate social distancing and implement temperature checks in many of our operations. We created flexible operating policies for our associates and our customers, implemented remote work plans and develop phase attendant strategies to ensure a safe environment. Importantly, we stepped up our communication approach with our global employee base. We distribute daily and weekly updates to provide information and progress reports on our collective efforts. Our technology platforms and talented IT teams have worked hard to enable a seamless transition to our new technological reality. Despite all our new routines, our 55,000 associates remain positive, productive and connected. We are also exceptionally proud to recognize our colleagues who have been so generous to give back to our communities throughout this crisis. We have continued our support of numerous charitable organizations, including internal relief funds that support fellow GPC team mates the need and have many examples where we have donated PPE and cleaning and safety supplies to hospitals and health care centers. In addition, our employees volunteered their time to numerous worthy causes. Giving back has and always will be a core GPC value. Given the circumstances, we will start by sharing a few first quarter highlights, and then we want to turn to, one, the business environment over the past 90 days; and two, how our teams have responded. After that, I'll provide commentary on each of the business segments before handing the call over to Carol to detail the financial results. So total sales for the first quarter were $4.6 billion, up 1.1%, excluding the impact of divestitures or down approximately 3.7% on a reported basis. For perspective, sales were up over 2% through February, despite mild weather and mixed industrial end market trends. Sales in the first half of March were also strong, up approximately 4% compared to the same period the prior year. As the virus impact accelerated, we experienced an approximate 16% sales decrease during the second half of March compared to the same period the prior year. Net income in the first quarter 2020 was $137 million and earnings per share were $0.94, with adjusted net income at $133 million or $0.92 per share. We estimate an approximate 3% negative impact to net sales and a $0.21 negative impact to EPS during the first quarter 2020 contributed to COVID-19. Moving to the business environment and our response. You might recall from our February earnings call, we highlighted the strong momentum the teams were building with a solid fourth quarter in 2019 performance. We entered 2020 focused on our strategic growth, improving our operating performance and capital allocation initiatives. 2020 was poised to be an exciting year for GPC. In mid-February, when we released our 2019 results, we spoke to these plans and initiatives as well as commenting on supply chain operations in China, which, at the time, was impacted by the outbreak. As the impact of COVID-19 was more broadly felt around the globe, we began to see declines in demand in mid-March. National lockdowns in France and New Zealand followed and broad shelter in place mandates impacted our operations. This trend continued for the balance of the first quarter and throughout the month of April. In response to the crisis, we have elevated the cadence in which we are managing the business. I am proud of the coordinated and strong leadership demonstrated across the company over the past two months. Teams have stepped up, acted urgently and executed with discipline. We increased the frequency of our global leadership cadence and formed a cross-functional COVID-19 response team to accelerate decision-making, analyze rapidly-changing information and coordinate sharing best practices across the global teams. As a result, we took rapid action to address our cost structures given the new realities of sales volume and business activity. We developed a disciplined process to identify, analyze and prioritize nearly 50 enterprise cost actions. Select cost savings actions put in place include delayed merit increases, headcount reductions, voluntary and involuntary leave of absences, hiring freezes, executive and officer pay reductions, reduced bonuses and commissions, government subsidies collections, reduction in hours of operations, rent relief, professional fees and marketing expense reductions, T&E reductions and facility closures, to name just a few. We created detailed scenario models and built a refined financial forecast process to assess weekly performance and adjust action to business reality. Our teams continue to evaluate and implement cost savings measures to appropriately respond to the business conditions and are focused on maintaining cost discipline as our markets recover. We should mention that our global supply chain is operating well. Our supply chain, including foreign and domestic manufacturing capacity and logistics, is largely performing at levels seen prior to COVID-19. We believe the power of our global operating scale, product and geographic diversification of supplier partners and intense teamwork across our business units, create an advantage as we work to minimize any potential service disruption for our customers. We continue to monitor a few geographies in specific product categories such as PPE that are still returning to pre-crisis levels, but we are cautiously optimistic about the path to full recovery. We would be remiss if we did not take the opportunity to publicly thank our GPC procurement teams and our valued suppliers for their unwavering partnership and support. Now let's turn to a review of our business segments, beginning with our global automotive group. For the first quarter, this group represented 57% of total revenues and had a sales decline of 1%, excluding divestitures. In our North American operations, U.S. automotive sales were down 3.8% in the first quarter, with comp sales down 5.7%. Primarily, the sales decline reflects the combination of a slow start to 2020 due to the mild winter weather that pressured sales in January and February and the impact of COVID-19 in the last half of March. While sales started strong in March, up 7% through midmonth, sales fell by 24% over the final two weeks of the quarter. These headwinds drove sales declines in both the commercial and retail segments of our business. And while the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our total U.S. automotive sales, outperformed our DIY sales for the quarter overall. This flipped in late March with DIY showing more resilience throughout this crisis. Under the current business conditions, online orders have increased significantly and have been an important factor in driving DIY sales. Our omnichannel initiatives, such as buy online, pick up in store, curbside pickup and expanded ship-to-home capabilities, including next-day delivery to every U.S. market, allow our customers a variety of convenient options when making a purchase. In addition, this environment has prompted us to provide additional services, such as same-day store deliveries on the DIY side and touchless delivery for our commercial customers. We believe that these services will prove to enhance our customer value proposition in both the near and long term. Before leaving our U.S. automotive operations, we thought we would share an update on the financial state of our independent owners and our good AutoCare customers. As we mentioned in our April six release, our NAPA team, along with several of our financial partners, are working closely with these independently-owned businesses to help them benefit from the financial assistance available to them. This has involved continued education regarding several programs, including the Cares Act. To date, the vast majority of our independent NAPA owners have applied for PPP assistance with 60% receiving funding and expect a decline. The majority of our owners have also applied for other financial support, such as loan payment deferrals and standard SBA loans for disaster relief. Importantly, we would emphasize that none of our NAPA owners had to close their businesses due to COVID-19. In addition, among our NAPA AutoCare center customers, most of which remain open for business, more than 60% have filed for assistance with over 40% currently funded. We are confident in the financial stability of these key partners and we'll continue to work with them to ensure they pull-through these difficult times. In Canada, we also experienced mid-single digit comp sales declines, which were partially offset by acquisitions. Through February, our Canadian business was trending slightly positive. Although sales began to gradually slow in early March before falling 25% over the last half of the month, in accordance with provincial shelter in place orders. In Europe, our automotive sales were up 14%, driven by the incremental benefit from the PartsPoint and Todd acquisitions in 2019. Sales were offset by a high single digit decline in core sales, driven primarily by COVID-19 as well as the impact of foreign currency. After posting relatively flat comp through February, sales in Europe slowed significantly in early March and were especially pressured following the March 17 preemptive government lockdown in France. France is our largest market in Europe, representing approximately 39% of total European revenues. And we look forward to the easing of these restrictions later this month. In light of our earlier expectations for much improved results for Europe in 2020, the current conditions represent a temporary setback, which our team is addressing via several measures, including aggressive cost reductions. In addition, with a vast network of operations across several key regions, including France, the U.K., Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium, we continue to view our expanded footprint in a large and fragmented European marketplace as an important competitive advantage. We are committed to our growth strategy for these operations and expect this business to emerge from the pandemic well positioned to actively build on its market-leading position in the recovery. Our strongest automotive results were in Australia and New Zealand, where we posted low single-digit comp growth and operating margin expansion despite a significant negative impact from foreign currency translation. This region was the least affected by COVID-19 in March. Although New Zealand, which represents less than 20% of our Australasian automotive revenues, was also under a mandatory lockdown. As in the U.S., online sales have been strong through this crisis and a solid driver of retail sales for this region. We continue to support our customers through buy online, pick up in store, and deliver from store capabilities, utilizing the Repco store fleet of delivery vehicles in all markets. With the dramatic growth in online demand, the timeliness of the Sparesbox acquisition in 2019 has proven especially beneficial. Sparesbox is Australia's leading online automotive parts and accessories business. And we have utilized its specialized expertise to enhance our understanding of the digital marketplace and improve our omnichannel capabilities in Australasia and across our global automotive operations. So that's a recap of the global automotive group and our first quarter performance. The headwinds we experienced relative to COVID-19 had a significant impact on demand late in the quarter. And despite our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the aftermarket, we expect a decline in miles driven, consumer spending and overall economic activity to continue to pressure this segment over the near term. Now turning to our global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales were $1.5 billion, up 4.7%, excluding the EIS divestiture. North American comp sales were down 3.1%, including an approximate 1% decline in sales due to the impact of COVID-19. This was offset by the addition of Inenco in Australasia as well as other acquisitions, which contributed 7.8% of sales. Inenco was acquired in July of 2019 and performed well in the first quarter despite the challenges of the lockdown in New Zealand as well as Southeast Asia. Looking further at Motion Industries, our North American industrial operations, the slowdown in the industrial economy over the last five to six months in 2019 was showing the early signs of a recovery in January and February. Leading indicators, such as the purchasing managers index and industrial production, pointed to a stabilizing industrial economy until March when COVID-19 presented a new set of challenges for the industry. The growing pressure on demand related to customer closures and the broad decline in economic activity over the last two weeks of March led to just two of our 14 product categories posting positive year-over-year sales gains in the first quarter. This, of course, includes our safety products category, which has benefited from the heightened demand for PPE and other safety supplies throughout the crisis. By industry sector, all 12 key groups posted year-over-year sales declines, ranging from slight decreases for the food processing and aggregate and cement sectors, to double-digit declines for equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and oil and gas. Despite the current sales environment, the Motion team operated well and delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement. Thus far, in the second quarter, the economic pressure of COVID-19 has continued to impact the demand environment. With that said, we sell to thousands of customers, representing a diverse cross-section of industry sectors, which should soften the level of sales declines for this business. Likewise, we continue to expand our automation solutions capabilities and prepare for the surge in demand associated with incremental maintenance and repairs in a recovery. We are actively tracking the status of our customers' factories and seeing more customers returning to work and opening their plant. This is a positive development for the industry, which we expect to drive improved demand for our core industrial categories, including powered transmission and electrical products, hydraulics, pneumatics and conveyance, among others. Rounding out our business segment updates, the Business Products Group reported sales of $468 million, down 2.3% or up 1.5%, excluding the impact of its SPR Canada and GCN divestitures. The 1.5% sales increase reflects the positive impact of especially strong sales of jan/san and safety supplies, which we began to see in connection with the COVID-19 in early March. This category was up 28% from last year and accounted for 46% of total revenues for this business segment in the first quarter. Sales in this category have offset the declines in our core business products categories. And while we expect these trends to continue as we battle through COVID-19, we anticipate a more challenging second quarter relative to Q1. Looking beyond these near-term trends, we continue to evaluate our longer-term plans for this business. So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol to give you a deeper look at our financials for the quarter. Carol? Thank you, Carol. We entered April well underway in our preparedness plans to protect our employees, customers and communities while also continuing to serve our customers and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Throughout the month, we were focused on the controlled execution of these plans and would highlight several key points. To date, we have been fortunate to have very few known COVID-19 cases among our 55,000 employees. A testament to the enhanced safety protocols we have implemented in our distribution centers, branches, stores and offices. Our operations are essential to our customers and remain substantially open across business segments and geographies. Our teams have been diligent and more frequent in their communications with employees and our supplier and customer partners. Our teams have been innovative in implementing new services that have proven valuable in driving sales. We have effectively realigned our capital allocation priority by reducing our capital expenditures and suspending share repurchases and M&A, while remaining committed to the dividend. And we have worked with our banks and other financial partners for additional forms of financing and amended debt covenants to provide ample liquidity through the crisis. Working together as one team, we believe the steps we are taking to stabilize our business in these unprecedented times, will position the company for strong sales and earnings growth as we exit this global pandemic. We acknowledge the unprecedented near-term challenges that we must navigate and corresponding hard work in front of us. With that said, we remain optimistic about the future as we've had significant learnings from the current business conditions. And the industry fundamentals across our automotive and industrial operations are strong and supportive of sustained long-term growth. The circumstances of COVID-19 have required us to assess and build on our existing capabilities. And in addition to our immediate crisis response actions, each business team has developed strategic recovery plans, that detail strategic investment and productivity priorities that we believe will accelerate our momentum following the crisis. We have also accelerated the urgency and traction of various transformation initiatives that were in process while identifying others as well. This has led us to consider actions to further optimize our portfolio, such as exiting underperforming operations and improve our operational profitability, such as with our cost savings initiatives. Additionally, we discovered new and better ways of serving our customers and managing our business. Refined approaches to order fulfillment and logistics, field and functional staffing models, digital sales and marketing programs are just a few examples. The time to market of these efforts has been dramatically reduced as well. Change is difficult for any organization, but the crisis has shown our teams, we can move with discipline and urgency to make a positive difference. So in closing, while we are focused on what we can control, we do believe the long-term industry fundamentals remain favorable across our business segments. Importantly, each of our businesses compete in very large and fragmented markets. In automotive, low fuel prices, the dramatic reduction in new vehicle production, shift in travel preferences, shift in personal versus public transportation behavior, potential deferrals of new car purchases and expectations for miles driven to ultimately recover and grow over the long term are all positive tailwinds for the industry. In Industrial, our broad and diverse customer base, change in philosophies on global manufacturing and the growing demand for plant automation solutions all remain positive long-term trends. Through prior downturns, we have generated significant cash flows despite difficult sales environment, and our end markets and business model have proven resilient. The strength of our operating model and cash flow profile over the years support our consistent track record of increasing the dividend for 64 consecutive years. Moving forward, we will remain focused on taking care of our people, our customers and our communities. We will also combine urgent immediate action with activities that will position us for the future. We are incredibly proud of the hard work of our global teams. So thank you for listening. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator, and Carol and I will be happy to take your questions. Liz, great question. We had a couple hour conference call with our European leadership team yesterday. And our markets where we have seen openings, i.e., in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, we are definitely seeing a resurgence in our sales top line. Those markets, they fared better than certainly our market in France and the U.K. France has been in lockdown for the longest period of time out of our markets, the U.K. locked down in late March. So those two have been dramatically impacted. We'll see France. What we hope, France will begin gradual reopening on May 11. We think U.K. will probably be later in May. But directly to your question, Liz, we are seeing an uptick, a nice uptick in sales in both Germany and the Netherlands. Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Liz, look, it's anybody's guess at this point. But we would certainly expect in the near-term that we will see folks gravitating to more driving, more utilization of their automobile versus jumping back on airplanes. So I would think we'll see that in all our markets, AsiaPac, Europe as well as across North America. You're welcome. Thank you, Liz. Morning, Bret. Well, Bret, it certainly is possible. We - I don't know that the automotive aftermarket is going to be that significantly different from other small businesses that have been impacted. I will tell you that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our - many of our independent owners have already taken part in the PPP and are financially strong as well as many of our NAPA AutoCare centers, as well, have taken advantage. So we think that, if anything, Bret, there perhaps may be some acquisition opportunities down the road for a company like ours with as strong a balance sheet as we continue to maintain. Yeah. Thank you, Bret. Okay. So I'll take a shot at that. What we saw in the month of April is sequential improvement throughout the month that has now carried over into May. So really, what we saw here in the U.S. is as states reopened, we saw our business ramp back up. We expect to see the same in Europe, as I mentioned earlier, as we've already seen in Germany and the Netherlands. We certainly expect that in Asia Pac as well. And as France comes back online, the U.K., we fully expect to see our business ramp back up. In Asia Pacific, we - New Zealand was in a total lockdown mode. That country is now reopening, and we've seen a resurgence in business, both in automotive and Industrial. Yeah. So let me take the first question first. So between our company stores and our independent-owned stores, the numbers and trends were very similar, so not a big discrepancy between those two. What I would say and I'll repeat what I said earlier, I believe the number that I've seen most recently is 60% of our independent owners have successfully applied for PPP funds. So to this point, our independent owners are in good shape. I believe over 90% have applied. And as you know, it's the banking system. Some of the applications have moved a bit slower, but we do believe that the program that the Fed has put out will benefit. And as it's designed to, should benefit small independent-owned businesses, like our good NAPA independent-owned stores as well as our NAPA AutoCare centers. So we think in the long haul, our group will be just fine. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, David. Welcome. We're happy to have you on our account. I'll tackle the second question first in terms of regional differences, probably no surprise where we have seen the most pressure from a regional standpoint is in the Northeast. So our good owners and company stores in and around New York, Boston, have really been challenged, again, should not be a surprise. The Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. was pressured as well. On the flip side, our business has maintained relatively well in the Midwest as well as the Mountain area, which - those two regions of the country also had good fourth quarters as well. So we appreciate the great job our leadership teams are doing in both those markets. In terms of the stimulus checks, we would think that it can only be a positive. It's hard to track, David, exactly to pinpoint if we've seen a lift week to week as a result of stimulus checks, but we have to believe that's a positive. I would also mention that - and as I did in my prepared remarks, we have seen a big uptick in our online and digital business, all across the GPC businesses. So again, the stimulus checks can only benefit our business in the long haul. Yeah, great question. And look, we've been investing in our online efforts both here in the U.S. as well as Australia. You might remember, David, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we did an acquisition in Australia last year of the leading online purveyor of auto parts, a company called Sparesbox, very timely acquisition for us. They brought a tremendous level of expertise and knowledge around all things digital, but also great automotive knowledge as well. So our business in Australia is up three times here over the last couple of months. Our business in the U.S. is up two times. Now granted, it is a fairly small base that we're coming off of. But we're thrilled with what we're seeing, and we'll continue to invest in our digital efforts across all of our businesses. Yeah. Thanks, David. Yeah, okay. I'll let Carol tackle the first question. And Greg, related to your DIY versus DIFM, as mentioned. DIFM, for us, outpaced DIY in the first quarter. We did see that flip in April, as I'm sure most did as states locked down. That said, I would tell you that our DIY business was still slightly down in April, although it did outpace DIFM. Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Okay. I'll tackle the regionality question, Chris, and I'll let Carol address the cost downs. Across the southern half of the U.S., our business was about in line with our overall business, certainly better than what we experienced in the Northeast, but not as good as what we saw in parts of the Midwest and the Mountain. So kind of in the middle of the pack. I think that's partially, Chris, it's probably fairly unique to our business. We have a large segment of business that's down in the islands and the Caribbean. Those stores are big volume stores, those stores all locked down early in the pandemic, and that's certainly swung, I think, a bit of the trend for us in the southern part of the U.S., but middle of the pack. And then I'll let Carol tackle some of the cost reduction question. Well, as we said earlier, Chris, we saw our business trend up the entire month. So week to week to week. And including now into the first week in May, we've seen our business improve. That said, our DIY business, I think your specific question, did it trend positive? It did not because we still had a significant decline in our footsteps into our stores, which, I guess, should not be surprised given how many cities and states were in total lockdown. There weren't a lot of folks out of shopping, unfortunately. Hence, the nice lift we saw in our digital and online business. Thank you, Chris. Okay. I guess we lost that. And Daniel, we should mention, and you all know this, but certainly, Europe was hit much earlier with the pandemic than certainly North America. If there's any good news to report, as we spoke to our teams yesterday, we do believe the worst in Europe is now behind us. We have peaked out. And again, we are now making plans to reopen in France and the U.K. We've already reopened and are doing well in Germany and the Netherlands. So the good news is the worst is behind us. The peak, we've crossed the peak, and we have better days in front of us in Europe. Yeah. And Daniel, it's a good question. And look, that initiative is still high on our priority list. I would tell you with what we're faced with and what our independent owners are faced with right now. We have put that essentially on hold. There are a few projects going here and there. But the large-scale rollout we have essentially put on hold, but it's temporary. And my hope will be that we see that ramp back up in the second half of the year. Okay. Thanks, Daniel. Thank you."

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The GPC team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, further building on the positive momentum of the first nine months of 2021. We are proud of our progress through the year and thankful to our 52,000 teammates for their hard work and ongoing commitment to excellence. With a tailwind of strong industry fundamentals, we executed on our key strategic priorities to accelerate sales, improved gross margin and enhanced operational efficiencies, which resulted in double-digit sales and earnings growth for both the quarter and full year. Our earnings growth and continued focus on working capital improvements also helped us to deliver strong cash flow. So just a tremendous effort by our global teams. They were laser-focused throughout the year and successfully navigated the ongoing challenges of the global supply chain, COVID disruptions and inflationary pressures. In early January, we successfully closed on our acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, an industrial distributor of power transmission, automation and fluid power solutions. We are integrating this highly synergistic acquisition into our Motion business to enhance our scale and further strengthen our market-leading position. We are pleased to welcome the Kaman team to GPC and we look forward to creating significant shareholder value as a premier leader in industrial solutions. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, a 13% increase from last year with broad strength across all our businesses. We delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. These efforts led to an 18% increase in the quarter in adjusted earnings per share. Total sales for the Global Automotive Group were $3.2 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from 2020. On a comp basis, sales were up 11% from 2020 with our U.S. business posting the strongest year-over-year comps and each of our international operations achieving high single-digit sales comp. In addition, we experienced a steady sales cadence throughout the quarter with double-digit total sales increases in all three months. The ongoing economic recovery has led to strong customer demand. Improving miles driven, delays of new car production and rising used car prices are keeping more cars on the road longer, generating increased repairs and maintenance. Our strategic growth initiatives are proving effective as well. We continue to work closely with global suppliers to manage through product delays and logistical challenges to improve inventory availability. Additionally, our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales and maintain margins throughout the inflationary environment in the latter half of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we also added 130,000 SKUs to our e-catalog with the integration of Auto Accessories Garage. We were also pleased to expand our global store footprint with the addition of several bolt-on acquisitions. In total, we added more than 50 net new stores across our network, with most of these coming in the fourth quarter. Finally, as we look ahead to April, we are excited for the launch of the new AAA-branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers. Looking next, at our Automotive highlights by region. Total U.S. sales were up 15%, with comp sales up 13% from last year. In Canada, total sales were up 11% with comp sales up 9% from 2020. The growth in Canada was much improved from the third quarter as the easing of lockdowns drove strong demand throughout the end of the year. In the U.S., sales to both commercial and retail customers were up double-digits, with positive ticket and traffic counts for the fourth consecutive quarter. Likewise, sales were strong across a broad range of products with categories such as chassis, exhaust, brakes and ride control all outperforming. Our DIY business remains strong, trending well above historical growth rates for the past several quarters. While initially driven by the increase in DIY demand due to COVID, we have sustained that growth through a number of initiatives, including enhanced in-store merchandising, training and development, and the continued rollout of customer services such as AfterPay, which offers existing and new customers buy now, pay later option. This program is in 1,200 stores today and currently available for all online purchases. NAPA online B2C sales continue to be our fastest-growing sales channel, up over 40% in Q4 and 53% for the full year, a 3x increase from our 2019 volume. The strength in commercial sales was driven by high-teen growth to our major account partners and sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers were up low-teens. The surge in members continued through the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 18,000 NAPA AutoCare Centers, an increase of over 800 shops from 2020. Rounding out our commercial segments. Fleet, government and other wholesale customers posted low double-digit sales growth for the quarter, so strong results across all our commercial accounts. In Europe, our AAG team continued to perform well with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. Our team delivered solid results across each of our seven markets, with the UK and Benelux each posting 20%-plus growth. Our teams on the ground continue to expand our market share across all important key account segment as well as accelerating the rollout of NAPA-branded products. In addition, we are pleased to report our 2021 acquisitions of Winparts, an online provider of parts and accessories; and J&S, a multi-store operation based in Ireland, both are performing above expectations. In our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 11% from 2020, with comp sales up 9% from last year and up a strong 25% on a two-year stack. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well, with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by accelerated digital strategy, NAPA store expansion and the Q4 reopening of key metro markets. So now, let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from last year, with comp sales up 12% from 2020. This is our third consecutive quarter of double-digit comps for this segment, driven by strong growth in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses. The sales cadence was consistent through the quarter with double-digit sales growth in all three months. The continued improvement in our Industrial sales trends reflects the benefits of our growth initiatives and ongoing strength of the industrial economy. Our Industrial team delivered positive sales growth across virtually all major product categories and industries we serve, including double-digit increases in the majority of our industry groups. These include sectors such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and aggregate and cement, among others. Our Industrial team continues to execute several initiatives to drive profitable growth. Our omnichannel build-outs of accelerated e-commerce growth and is driving sales with new customers. We are encouraged by the incremental sales for our inside sales center and on motion.com. We have expanded our industrial services and value-add solutions capabilities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. And our enhanced strategy to compete in a dynamic pricing environment provides us a competitive advantage while also helping us offset inflationary pressures. Our Motion team made tremendous progress with these initiatives in the quarter and the year, and we expect to make further progress again in 2022. In addition, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our products and services offerings and expand our footprint. The added scale, presence and capabilities through the KDG acquisition is a great example, checking several boxes with its core power transmission and bearings business, and automation and fluid power industrial services and solutions. KDG's highly complementary growth and productivity strategies, product offering, and value-added services provide tremendous synergies and growth prospects. Our Motion team is actively bringing together the world-class talent and industrial expertise of these two organizations to build an even stronger business. In 2021, we remain focused on the positive impact of sustainable business practices. We updated our 2021 sustainability report, highlighting our progress in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, and reducing the environmental impact of our operations. Today, we are in process of measuring our global emissions and building a strategy for targeted improvement. We will be sharing additional highlights as we move through 2022. Finally, as most of you are probably aware, we announced last month that Carol will be retiring in May after an exceptional 30-year career. As our CFO for the pastnine years, Carol's leadership and countless contributions were integral to the significant growth and strong financial performance of the company. She will be greatly missed by all of us. We were pleased to announce that Bert Nappier will be stepping in as our next CFO. Bert is a strategic financial executive with a diverse background spanning 25 years, including the past 16 years with FedEx serving most recently as EVP Finance and Treasurer. Bert has also served as President of FedEx Express Europe and CEO of TNT Express. We are confident Bert's strong financial background along with his extensive international experience will make him a great addition to the GPC team. Carol and Bert will work together over the next few months to ensure an orderly and seamless transition. Carol will be with us for our first quarter earnings call in April, and Bert will join us on the call as well. We look forward to introducing Bert to all of you in the months ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2021 and pivot to 2022, I'd like to reiterate Paul's comments and thank the global GPC teams for an amazing performance in 2021. Passion for our customers, a team approach and relentless hard work translated into impressive results. We're incredibly proud of the entire GPC team. We also want to thank our strategic suppliers who closely partner with us in a challenging environment. As we discussed entering 2021, we wanted to catapult out of 2020 to deliver a great year. We're proud that each of our global business units delivered exceeding initiative and annual financial commitment in 2021. Our strong global performance is a great example of the power of one GPC team. When we focus on key priorities and collectively execute as a team. We enter 2021 with a clear strategy and focused business mix. Across the company, we identified strategic initiatives to further simplify and integrate our operations. We do this to enable a better customer experience and move at a faster, more efficient team pace. Our 2021 plans are part of a strategic vision that extends our leadership positions in attractive, highly fragmented markets. As part of our vision, our foundational priorities remain talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Each business unit and functional teams are executing multiyear plans across these pillars. As Paul highlighted, 2021 offered numerous examples of great progress. Progress to simplify include our action to optimize facility footprints, realign team structures, offshore field support activities, reduce IT system complexity, streamline back-office processes, leverage shared global vendor relationships and centralized indirect sourcing activities to name a few. In each example, we reduced cost, increased efficiency and better positioned our business to scale growth. Our One GPC team approach enables us to leverage GPC's scale and create value together. As we simplify our customer experience continues to be at the center of our daily action, we continue to listen, understand and act. As an example, the US Automotive team revamped our Voice of Customer Program to create more actionable data-backed customer feedback. We've seen a 40% reduction in customer issue tickets, 50% reduction in time to resolution and 90% reduction in unresolved issues. Our long-term success starts first with talent and culture, attracting and promoting talent to lead high-performing diverse teams. We made impressive progress in 2021. A few examples include the addition of merchandising and supply chain leadership at US Automotive, technology leadership in North America Automotive, field leadership and sales promotions in North America Industrial and executive leadership promotions in Australia and Europe. Despite the challenging talent environment, we believe our recent progress supports the differentiated and inclusive employee value proposition GPC offers. As an example, in our Atlanta headquarter office, over 60% of our current teammates represent diverse talent and 75% of our new hires in 2021 represented diverse teammates. We are committed to our GPC culture advantage. Our sales effectiveness initiatives delivered exciting wins in 2021 as the teams achieved broad-based profitable growth. We make sure we adjust our resources and strategies to serve our customer segments profitably and efficiently. Examples of our actions include inside sales coverage, corporate account disciplines, digital marketing strategies, strategic promotional activities and feet on the street to name a few. We complement these selling efforts with data-backed pricing and sourcing initiatives to ensure we deliver profitable growth. Technology enables this disciplined approach to sales excellence. Our technology initiatives also delivered returns in 2021. In North America Automotive, we made progress across digital, store systems, supply chain and data platform initiatives. Examples include; enhancements for competitive pricing intelligence, customer relationship management tools, product catalog and site search, and customer-specific system integrations. We accelerated third-party technology partners that offer faster path to delivering new capabilities and impact. We also made good progress to standardize and simplify our foundational tech infrastructure. These investments support a seamless omnichannel customer experience and are enabling above-average growth across all our digital channels. We also made progress with supply chain initiatives. The challenging global supply chain reinforced our focus on operational productivity investments. Our investments in supply chain talent, inventory, technology, labor and freight productivity, facility automation and network optimization are gaining traction. Our focus on emerging technology accelerated in 2021 with talent, analytics, strategic planning and global teamwork. Examples of progress include commercial partnerships with emerging technology companies such as Arrival and Wallbox, focused partnerships with key strategic suppliers and merchandising strategies for existing EV repair needs, to name just a few. M&A execution was also active in 2021. We completed various U.S. automotive and international bolt-ons that extend leadership positions in key local markets. We closed the year with the announcement of the KDG acquisition, which extends the market-leading position of our North American industrial platform. As Paul mentioned, the integration efforts are well underway and we remain bullish on the outlook for the combined business and the synergy plans. As we pivot to 2022, we have the same level of focus. Our 2022 priorities remain unchanged, as we look to continue the momentum. The global GPC teams have a strong resolve to take on uncontrollable challenges. And we're confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and earn success. Before I turn it over to Carol, I'd like to acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we appreciate all you have done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years. With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol?\nCarol Yancey: Thank you Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on quarterly and full year adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the unusual items outlined in our press release. Recapping revenues, total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% from 2020. For the full year, sales were $18.9 billion, up 14%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 35.3%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the year, gross margin improved 70 basis points to 35.2% versus last year. For the quarter and the full year, our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to strong sales volumes and the ongoing positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% from 2020 and at 28% of sales. For the year, these expenses are $5.31 billion, up 13% and also at 28% of sales. The increase in expenses for the quarter and the full year primarily reflect the increase in variable costs on our strong sales growth, including the impact of higher incentive compensation. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost pressures in areas such as base wages, freight and health insurance. And finally, our prior year results included benefits of temporary savings related to the pandemic. Our permanent cost savings achieved in 2020 helped to offset rising costs and difficult year-over-year comparisons. And as we've shared today and throughout the year, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to further reduce our expenses and to improve our operational efficiencies. This will be important in managing through the continuing inflationary pressures on costs in 2022. Our segment profit in the fourth quarter was $420 million, up 12% and our segment profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.8% last year. This slight decline was expected and primarily reflects the impact of prior year temporary savings and the year-over-year increase in incentive compensation. Our 8.7% margin reflects a 100 basis point improvement from 2019. For the full year, segment profit was $1.7 billion, up 24% on a 14% sales increase and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 8.2% last year, a 60 basis point increase from 2020 and 100 basis points from 2019. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2000. So we're very pleased with the improvement in margin and the tremendous work by our teams. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.6% compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the decrease in rate primarily related to a geographic shift in income. For the year, our tax rate was 24.9% compared to 24.5% in the prior year and primarily due to the increase in certain international tax rates throughout the year. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations on both a reported and adjusted basis was $256 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.79. This compares to $221 million or $1.52 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year or an 18% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $899 million or $6.23 per share, and adjusted net income was $997 million or $6.91 per share, a 31% increase from 2020. So now turning to our fourth quarter results by segment. Total Automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 13% from last year. Our segment profit increased 11% to $266 million, with profit margin at 8.3%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to higher incentive compensation and the prior year benefit of temporary savings, this represents a 110 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the strong underlying progress in our operations. For the year, profit margin was 8.6% up 60 basis points from 2020 and up 100 basis points from 2019. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 13% from 2020. Our segment profit of $154 million was up 15% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, up 20 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019. For the full year, profit margin for this segment is 9.4%, up 90 basis points from 2020 and up 130 basis points from 2019. So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At December 31, our total accounts receivable were up 15%, primarily due to the increase in sales and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory was up 11%, a function of the sales increase and our commitment to having the right parts in the right place at the right time. Accounts payable increased 16% from 2020 due to the increase in inventory and extended payment terms with our global suppliers. Our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 124% from 118% in the prior year. Our total debt at December 31 is $2.4 billion, down 10% from December of 2020. We closed the fourth quarter with available liquidity of $2.2 billion, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.4 times from 1.9 times in 2020. In early January this year, we issued $1 billion in new public debt in connection with the KDG acquisition. This consisted of a three-year $500 million bond at a 1.75% interest rate and 10-year $500 million bonds at a 2.75% rate. This raises our total debt to approximately $3.4 billion and our forecasted debt-to-EBITDA to 1.8 times, which is well within our targeted range and maintains our investment-grade rating. We generated $250 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, and our earnings growth and working capital drove $1.3 billion in cash from operations for the full year. Our free cash flow was $992 million. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $266 million for a broad range of investments such as supply chain projects at our distribution centers, including automation and other equipment for added efficiencies, digital initiatives and IT systems and software development. We will continue to reinvest in our business to drive organic growth and to improve the productivity in our operations in 2022. We also invested $284 million of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments primarily consisted of various automotive store groups across our geographies as well as online and Internet businesses, which provides us with expanded market coverage and a high return on investment. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both the Automotive and Industrial segments, and we look forward to the benefits of the Kaman Distribution acquisition. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948. And in 2021, we paid total cash dividends of approximately $466 million. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.58 per share annual dividend for 2022, representing our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 10% increase from the $3.26 per share paid in 2021. Additionally, we have an active share buyback program dating back to 1994. In the fourth quarter, we used $50 million to purchase 400,000 shares. And for the year, we used $334 million to purchase 2.6 million shares. As of December 31, we were authorized to repurchase up to 11.9 million shares, and we continue to be active in this program in 2022. So turning to our outlook for 2022. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 2% headwind from foreign currency translation and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales growth which is before the impact of acquisitions and FX. And a total sales increase of plus 20% to plus 22% for the Industrial segment which includes the addition of KDG and a 4% to 6% comp sales increase. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.60 and this represents an 8% to 10% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2021. So that's my financial update. And throughout the quarter and full year, our teams were focused on driving strong sales, improved margins, exceptional cash flow, and they delivered on every count. We're thankful for all the great work by our teammates. And as we move forward in the new year, there is tremendous momentum in our businesses. We look forward to reporting on our first quarter 2022 performance in April. As Paul mentioned earlier, the April earnings call will be my last as CFO. It was a difficult decision to retire from the company that I love, but the timing was right, and we're in capable hands with a talented team in place to support Bert. He is well qualified and his experience and skills make him the right person to serve as our next CFO. I'm excited to work with Bert over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you and I'll now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. With the fourth quarter now behind us, we can safely say that 2021 was an exceptional year for GPC. Throughout the year, our team focused on advancing the strategic priorities for our global Automotive and industrial businesses. With the backdrop of our multiyear portfolio optimization strategy, the economic recovery and strong industry fundamentals, we generated double-digit sales and earnings growth and significantly improved our profit margin. We are proud of our strong financial performance and the many accomplishments of the GPC team. Our results drove strong cash flow, which further supported our balance sheet strength. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing for enhanced productivity and growth through capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. In total, we were pleased to effectively deploy $1.35 billion for these key priorities in 2021. So now turning to 2022, we are confident in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability as we build on the underlying momentum in both our Automotive and Industrial operations, and realize the benefits from our acquisition of KDG. We are well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined, value-creating capital allocation, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. We thank you for your interest in and support of GPC, and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering a terrific year for GPC. So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, sir.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Just -- I guess, Paul, my question is, given the different levels of openness that we've seen in various states and geographies, have you seen a lot of variability in sales cadence across your business? And then related to that, does the Industrial segment also experienced regional variability or sales variance is usually driven just by end market activity? Thanks.\nPaul Donahue: Hey, thanks, Scot. And hey, Scot, welcome back. Glad to have you back on the call. What I would tell you about US Automotive, Scot, when I go through region-by-region, first off, every region in Q4 was up double digit, which I don't recall that in a number of years. Both coasts were the strongest. When I look at the East Coast, up and down the East Coast, from Atlantic, Northeast, Southeast, all strong, West, really strong. But even that, it's hard to single out one of our regions, all were up double digits. So really, really terrific performance up and down. On the Industrial side, again, double-digit increases every month in Q4. And we really don't see much regionality on the Industrial side, either. It was, again, every region performed extremely well. And I will tell you, Scot, I couldn't be more proud of our team. In a pretty challenging environment, the increases they delivered were just outstanding.\nScot Ciccarell: And then Paul, when you assess the growth that you're also seeing in a bunch of your international markets, are there any nuances about the US market that might be a little bit different than international, whether it's rate of increase of used vehicle prices, et cetera, that is continuing to boost the US a little bit higher than what we're seeing here nationally right now?\nPaul Donahue: Well, I would -- I guess what I would call out, Scot, if you look and compare the US and let's call out Europe. Europe is such a dominant DIFM market, 90% to 95% of our business in Europe is DIFM. So very, very little DIY business. And as we all know, we really saw the DIY segment spike during COVID and with all the monies that were being pushed out into the marketplace to consumers. So -- but I would also tell you Scot, we're seeing a bit more supply chain challenges in US Automotive than we're seeing either in Australia or Europe. So that would certainly be a callout. But look, again, I'm really pleased to tell you that while the US Automotive group led the way, we saw once again really strong performance in both Europe and Asia Pac as well.\nScot Ciccarell: Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Scot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nChristopher Horvers: Thanks and good morning and congratulations, Carol, on your retirement. It's been a pleasure working with you all of these years.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Chris.\nChristopher Horvers: My first question is a bit of a follow-up to Scot. As you think about 2022, how do you think about the relative comp potential in the different geographies in the NAPA business? And then specifically in the US, how are you thinking about your DIY business relative to the commercial business? Do you think DIY could be up? Obviously, you're very heavily weighted towards the commercial side.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So let me just clarify, Chris. When you talk about the different geographies, are you talking different geographies in the US or US compared to Europe and Asia Pac?\nChristopher Horvers: Yes, the global regions.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So as we look at our outlook for 2022, we're -- our expectation is we're going to continue to see solid growth across all of our markets. And I would tell you that while it's very early, we're six weeks into the year, we are seeing those trends carry over from 2021 into 2022. So -- but overall, our expectation is that we come in the year in all of our markets, somewhere in that five to seven range, which has kind of been our historical targets. So, -- but it certainly could be a bit stronger than that here in the U.S. And then your question, Chris, around DIY and DIFM -- and you mentioned it, our strength is certainly DIFM, and we had a terrific year in DIFM in 2021, both our NAPA AutoCare Center business, our major account business, our fleet business, all up double-digit. Our DIY business performed very well again. But we always remind ourselves, we're coming off a really small base. But I think some of the actions that our team has taken over the last couple of years in terms of really improving our store assortments, our store training, our hours all has really gone a long way in spiking our retail business. And we expect that to continue really strong as well.\nChristopher Horvers: And then, just as a follow-up to that, did you see -- you lapped through but just stimulus in January for the consumer. Did the DIY business see pressure during that period? Likewise, did it come down?\nPaul Donahue: Not at all, not at all which gives me a lot of confidence as we move throughout the year.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then, my last -- I have a ton of questions, but my last question here is, did you talk about what the inflation was in NAPA and in Motion in the fourth quarter? And how you're thinking about 2022?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. Happy to, look at that. When we look at Q4, and again, it was similar to what we alluded to when we came out of Q3 that it was certainly a little bit heavier in the quarter with a mid-single digit for Global Automotive and a little bit stronger, obviously, on the U.S. Automotive than International Automotive, giving us around a 3% for the full year. And it was low-single digit for Global Industrial. Again, theirs was pretty normal throughout the year. As we look ahead, we certainly see a planned carryover impact from Q3 and Q4 going into 2022. So we think first half 2022 will be similar to what we saw coming out of second half 2021. And then it moderates into the second half. So again, a bit stronger in the U.S. Automotive but -- and more normal in our international Automotive and Industrial, so you may see something like around a 3%-ish or again, a bit more than that in the U.S., and that's what we're contemplating in our 2022 numbers.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thank you very much.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Chris.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nEthan Huntley: Hey. Good morning. This is Ethan Huntley on for Bret. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just one here, surrounding market share within the Automotive Segment, I know one of your peers mentioned sort of taking price in an effort to gain share. Can you just sort of comment on sort of general industry dynamics you're seeing there and what you expect to see from a market share standpoint?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Sure, happy to, Evan. We -- look, we have historically had a very rational environment across the automotive aftermarket in the U.S. And honestly, we don't expect that to shift in a dramatic way one way or the other. But that said, I would tell you that our teams are always looking at prices across the markets and market dynamics, and we'll look down to the SKU level and category level. But I would tell you at this point, Evan, we're focused on our actions. We intend to take good care of our customers. And we'll continue to compete in the marketplace on certainly, our NAPA product quality, our availability and really our great people that we've got in our stores and just continuing to deliver outstanding customer service to all of our great customers.\nEthan Huntley: Great. That's helpful. And then just lastly here, on the European NAPA private label business, can you just sort of touch on how that's going? Are you sort -- continuing to see strong traction there and then maybe how inventory is faring related to the private label business?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Maybe Will and I tag team that. I would just give you from a high-level view, and we were over in Europe with the team a couple of weeks ago, the NAPA rollout continues very strong. As you may know, we kicked it off in the UK a couple of years ago. And we've now rolled out a number of product categories. We continue to expand into new product categories. So we're in chassis, brakes. We're looking at launching oil, have launched oil, steering calipers, toolboxes. So we continue to expand the offering, but we're also expanding into new markets. So we've gone beyond the UK into France. We've launched now Germany, Netherlands, and continues to perform very, very well. So I don't know, Will, is there anything you would add?\nWill Stengel: No. I would just say from an inventory perspective, we continue to feel good about having access to product in all of the markets that we're rolling now. So, continued success and exciting outlook for the future.\nEthan Huntley: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nPaul Donahue: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. So Carol thanks for all the help, and I'm going to ask you for a little more help.\nCarol Yancey: Okay. Thanks.\nGreg Melich: On SG&A, I mean if the dollars grew a lot, and I know you mentioned wage pressure, new bases there, incentive comp, et cetera. How should we think about SG&A leverage this year or not, other initiatives to sort of help offset that inflation as you look at your guidance?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. I mean, look, Q4 -- and again, Q4 SG&A, we knew going into this quarter that we had a fair amount of headwinds. The temporary cost savings last year, roughly $40 million, mean that was almost 90 basis points on our SG&A in the quarter. The increase in incentive compensation was meaningful similar to the temporary cost savings. That was a meaningful number. And then just the normal inflationary pressures, which we called out in Q3 and continued into Q4, on wages and freight, really, freight was certainly a big headwind for us. And then, we've got investments in projects and technology supply chain. But on the tailwind side, I mean, again, I would call out our strong leverage with our strong growth and being able to leverage better than we have in the past. And then the ongoing benefit of our initiatives. So we continue to have terrific initiatives. There was a lot of puts and takes, but ultimately, we had a better year in our SG&A than what we started off with, and the teams have done a terrific job in a really tight labor market and really having to do more with less. And again, as we look ahead into 2022 and your comments, we are implying certainly operating margin improvement, and we would expect to hold on to our gross margin rate in a highly inflationary environment and have initiatives that may even bring that up a bit. And at the same time, we think we're going to get some improvement in SG&A as we go into 2022, and that's coming off of our initiatives.\nGreg Melich: That's a great summary. And then I guess my follow-up was, I don't care if it was Paul or Will, but I think in the prepared comments, you mentioned that supply chain is tougher in the US than rest of world. So I just love some more commentary on it. Like why is that? And why do you think that -- is it going to persist?\nWill Stengel: Yeah, Greg, it's largely a function of just the logistics of the global freight. And so if you think about the port congestion out on the West Coast, that's probably the most elevated area that's congested. So that's largely why we would describe it as more affected than Europe and just the magnitude of the volume of the products coming in through US and North America. So -- we're encouraged by cautiously optimistic, I should say, about what we're seeing in all things, global supply chain. Good news is it's being driven by good underlying growth and demand. The factories internationally seem to be handling that volume better. As I mentioned, the congestion at the ports is still something that is being slowly addressed with some work to do, but moving in the right direction. And then obviously, the cost of moving product around the world continues to be elevated relative to historical average. And so we'll continue to work through that as well. So cautiously optimistic as we look through into 2022.\nPaul Donahue: And hey, Greg, I would just add to that, that we haven't seen the degradation in supply chain on the industrial side. Our industrial fill rates have, throughout this past 18 months or so, have remained pretty good, certainly better than what we've seen on the US Automotive side. So our challenge has largely relegated to US Automotive. But as Will said, we are beginning to see an uptick in our fill rates across most of our major suppliers. And look, we know our supplier partners, they have got challenges as it relates to COVID and labor and material shortages. So they're doing all they can for us. And we do believe with our size and scale, that if anybody is going to get product in this environment, it will be Genuine Parts Company.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Good luck guys.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Greg.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. Good morning and congrats on your retirement, Carol.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you very much.\nSeth Basham: I have a follow-up question to the comment you just made, Paul. Just thinking about the supply dynamics for a lot of the smaller regional competitors in the US auto aftermarket business, how do you think the competitive environment can change as supply chain challenges ease, those players get more products? Do you think that it becomes more price competitive?\nPaul Donahue: No, I don't think so, Seth. I mean, look, if you go back -- and I've been at this a long time in this automotive aftermarket, price has never been the primary driver in the automotive aftermarket, Seth. And as I think I mentioned earlier, we focus on just putting out a great product, a quality product, having it available when our customers want it, delivering an incredibly fast fashion, having great people on the ground. And then, yes, you've got to have a competitive price on top of it. But certainly, price is not going to be the number one driver nor has it ever been in the automotive aftermarket.\nSeth Basham: Understood. Okay. Thank you. And then I have a separate follow-up question around KDG. Can you just give us a sense of what the contribution you're anticipating is in terms of sales and EPS from the acquisition in 2022?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. I'll walk through that. I mean, again, as we talked about on our December conference call with KDG, I mean, the sales of roughly $1.1 billion, our guidance of 21% to 22% and the core growth of 5% to 6%, the balance of that is KDG. So we've kind of given you the 5% to 6% with KDG being the difference there. And again, similar to what we gave you in December with the EBITDA margin, again, you're talking about in the 8% to 9% range. What you have to think about, and again, I've implied that and we've got segment operating profit improvement going into next year, both with and without Kaman, when you roll it all the way down to net profit and EPS, as we've talked about earlier, you have to take into account the incremental interest expense as well as the intangible amortizations. And again, it's early in the process, obviously, the pace of synergies is the significant driver here based on where we are now and what we know, that's all sort of rolling up to roughly a $0.10 impact for this year. But again, we're only six weeks in on the synergies, really highly encouraged by what the teams are going to do. But again, we do have the implied operating margin improvement in those numbers.\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Seth, I would just add to that. We are very, very encouraged what we're seeing in the early days. As Carol mentioned, we're six weeks in, but the team is out of the blocks strong. We've met with the majority of our key customers, our key suppliers in this first six weeks. The team has put an incredible amount of effort. They got a great plan in place, and we're excited with having the Kaman team as a part of GPC and we know they're going to deliver great things for us in the next few years.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thank you very much and good luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Seth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hopped on late, but I hope that I -- didn't address this already. But I wanted to ask just on the status, obviously, your fill rates seem to be getting better, and you guys have improved that supply chain through the back half of the year. What do you guys do with the biggest risks from here to your supply chain? And related to that, one of your peers has talked more about direct sourcing straight from the Far East, kind of end rounding some of the suppliers. Would love to hear your thoughts around that strategy and potential. Would that be something GPC looks to do that expands margins or how you weigh the pros and cons of that strategy? Thanks.\nWill Stengel: Hey, Daniel, I'll hit the first piece of your question in terms of biggest risk, and Paul will maybe come on behind my comments. But I think the biggest risk is talent, and it's more a internal risk just having the talent into buildings to handle the increased product flow as we recover. We've talked a lot about the labor market and having access to people in the buildings, drivers, et cetera. So from our perspective, making sure that we continue to build on all the great momentum and progress we're making around all things people and making sure that we're staffed up on our end to handle the improving volume.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. And Daniel, I'll just mention that, look, we've been on the ground with a full team in place in Shenzhen, China now for the better part of a decade. And we're sourcing product today, direct sourcing product for all of our automotive businesses around the world. We go to the same factories. We consolidate our purchases between Europe, Asia Pac and the US. So we've been there for the better part of a decade, and it's worked extremely well for us.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. And so the relationships with the suppliers, you still have polisher reads, those are value-added and where you direct source where you could direct stores you already do?\nPaul Donahue: That's correct.\nDaniel Imbro: Perfect. That's helpful. And then again, I apologize if you addressed this and not to get too near-term focused, but just think about Europe, the two-year stack did slow a bit on the auto side. Obviously, Europe had some pretty strict shutdowns with COVID through the fourth quarter. Just curious what you're seeing in that market and whether some countries are maybe outperforming as they reopen or any competitive changes? We've heard anecdotes of smaller competitors closing over there. So just curious how you're thinking about that market into 2022 and 2023?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So Daniel, we're in seven different markets across Europe, including the UK. The UK and Benelux countries were our strongest performers in 2021. And really continue to deliver. The UK was also our initial launch point for our NAPA-branded product. So they've got a bit of a head start on the rest of Europe. All seven countries are positive, and we certainly expect that trend to continue into 2022. We've got a great team on the ground in Europe, and we're very bullish on the outlook for our business there.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck\nPaul Donahue: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question by Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thanks for letting me on and I'll add my congratulations to you, Carol. It's been great working with you over the last decade.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Liz.\nLiz Suzuki: So you guys have done some meaningful M&A recently and then your more standard tuck-in acquisitions. And would you categorize the M&A environment broadly as more attractive now than it has been for the last two years? Just with a lot of disruption in the market from inflation and supply chain constraints without the support of PPP loans that I think may have helped some of your smaller competitors during the height of COVID.\nWill Stengel: Yes, Liz, I think we would agree with that statement. The M&A pipeline continues to be very active. I think GPC and both on the Automotive and Industrial side of the business continues to be viewed as an acquirer of choice. And I think scale matters and especially in times where there's kind of an uncertain environment, joining the market-leading businesses and becoming part of the family is a pretty exciting proposition. So we expect that to continue and continue the good amount of activity that we've seen over the last 12 to 24 months.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. And I'll just tack on one more, which is, if you could just talk a little bit about the partnership with Wallbox. I mean, is this going to be an exclusive relationship where NAPA is the destination for the PULSAR plus and is this -- is the audience for these charges primarily the DIY customer, or will you have an opportunity to sell the dealerships and other large accounts as well?\nWill Stengel: Yes. It's a exciting opportunity for us. It\u2019s not an exclusive relationship but it does have implications for both DIY and DIFM. And I think it's a real good example on kind of the opportunity that NAPA has to extend its business model. And so we talked about Arrival, we talked about Wallbox. But whether it's charging stations, service of the future, et cetera, we're excited about it and -- what it's also doing is creating a lot of buzz and momentum with other strategic partnerships. So, the discussions are active and the pipeline for more of these is pretty robust. So we're excited about it and looking forward. It's early days, but looking forward to what it could do for the business.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thanks very much.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Liz.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: We'd like to thank you for your interest and participation in our fourth quarter and year-end earnings. We appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to reporting out our first quarter results in April. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2021 and pivot to 2022, I'd like to reiterate Paul's comments and thank the global GPC teams for an amazing performance in 2021. Passion for our customers, a team approach and relentless hard work translated into impressive results. We're incredibly proud of the entire GPC team. We also want to thank our strategic suppliers who closely partner with us in a challenging environment. As we discussed entering 2021, we wanted to catapult out of 2020 to deliver a great year. We're proud that each of our global business units delivered exceeding initiative and annual financial commitment in 2021. Our strong global performance is a great example of the power of one GPC team. When we focus on key priorities and collectively execute as a team. We enter 2021 with a clear strategy and focused business mix. Across the company, we identified strategic initiatives to further simplify and integrate our operations. We do this to enable a better customer experience and move at a faster, more efficient team pace. Our 2021 plans are part of a strategic vision that extends our leadership positions in attractive, highly fragmented markets. As part of our vision, our foundational priorities remain talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Each business unit and functional teams are executing multiyear plans across these pillars. As Paul highlighted, 2021 offered numerous examples of great progress. Progress to simplify include our action to optimize facility footprints, realign team structures, offshore field support activities, reduce IT system complexity, streamline back-office processes, leverage shared global vendor relationships and centralized indirect sourcing activities to name a few. In each example, we reduced cost, increased efficiency and better positioned our business to scale growth. Our One GPC team approach enables us to leverage GPC's scale and create value together. As we simplify our customer experience continues to be at the center of our daily action, we continue to listen, understand and act. As an example, the US Automotive team revamped our Voice of Customer Program to create more actionable data-backed customer feedback. We've seen a 40% reduction in customer issue tickets, 50% reduction in time to resolution and 90% reduction in unresolved issues. Our long-term success starts first with talent and culture, attracting and promoting talent to lead high-performing diverse teams. We made impressive progress in 2021. A few examples include the addition of merchandising and supply chain leadership at US Automotive, technology leadership in North America Automotive, field leadership and sales promotions in North America Industrial and executive leadership promotions in Australia and Europe. Despite the challenging talent environment, we believe our recent progress supports the differentiated and inclusive employee value proposition GPC offers. As an example, in our Atlanta headquarter office, over 60% of our current teammates represent diverse talent and 75% of our new hires in 2021 represented diverse teammates. We are committed to our GPC culture advantage. Our sales effectiveness initiatives delivered exciting wins in 2021 as the teams achieved broad-based profitable growth. We make sure we adjust our resources and strategies to serve our customer segments profitably and efficiently. Examples of our actions include inside sales coverage, corporate account disciplines, digital marketing strategies, strategic promotional activities and feet on the street to name a few. We complement these selling efforts with data-backed pricing and sourcing initiatives to ensure we deliver profitable growth. Technology enables this disciplined approach to sales excellence. Our technology initiatives also delivered returns in 2021. In North America Automotive, we made progress across digital, store systems, supply chain and data platform initiatives. Examples include; enhancements for competitive pricing intelligence, customer relationship management tools, product catalog and site search, and customer-specific system integrations. We accelerated third-party technology partners that offer faster path to delivering new capabilities and impact. We also made good progress to standardize and simplify our foundational tech infrastructure. These investments support a seamless omnichannel customer experience and are enabling above-average growth across all our digital channels. We also made progress with supply chain initiatives. The challenging global supply chain reinforced our focus on operational productivity investments. Our investments in supply chain talent, inventory, technology, labor and freight productivity, facility automation and network optimization are gaining traction. Our focus on emerging technology accelerated in 2021 with talent, analytics, strategic planning and global teamwork. Examples of progress include commercial partnerships with emerging technology companies such as Arrival and Wallbox, focused partnerships with key strategic suppliers and merchandising strategies for existing EV repair needs, to name just a few. M&A execution was also active in 2021. We completed various U.S. automotive and international bolt-ons that extend leadership positions in key local markets. We closed the year with the announcement of the KDG acquisition, which extends the market-leading position of our North American industrial platform. As Paul mentioned, the integration efforts are well underway and we remain bullish on the outlook for the combined business and the synergy plans. As we pivot to 2022, we have the same level of focus. Our 2022 priorities remain unchanged, as we look to continue the momentum. The global GPC teams have a strong resolve to take on uncontrollable challenges. And we're confident in our ability to continue to remain agile and earn success. Before I turn it over to Carol, I'd like to acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we appreciate all you have done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years. With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol? No. I would just say from an inventory perspective, we continue to feel good about having access to product in all of the markets that we're rolling now. So, continued success and exciting outlook for the future. Yeah, Greg, it's largely a function of just the logistics of the global freight. And so if you think about the port congestion out on the West Coast, that's probably the most elevated area that's congested. So that's largely why we would describe it as more affected than Europe and just the magnitude of the volume of the products coming in through US and North America.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on quarterly and full year adjusted results from continuing operations, which excludes the unusual items outlined in our press release. Recapping revenues, total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% from 2020. For the full year, sales were $18.9 billion, up 14%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 35.3%, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the year, gross margin improved 70 basis points to 35.2% versus last year. For the quarter and the full year, our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to strong sales volumes and the ongoing positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. Our total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% from 2020 and at 28% of sales. For the year, these expenses are $5.31 billion, up 13% and also at 28% of sales. The increase in expenses for the quarter and the full year primarily reflect the increase in variable costs on our strong sales growth, including the impact of higher incentive compensation. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost pressures in areas such as base wages, freight and health insurance. And finally, our prior year results included benefits of temporary savings related to the pandemic. Our permanent cost savings achieved in 2020 helped to offset rising costs and difficult year-over-year comparisons. And as we've shared today and throughout the year, we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to further reduce our expenses and to improve our operational efficiencies. This will be important in managing through the continuing inflationary pressures on costs in 2022. Our segment profit in the fourth quarter was $420 million, up 12% and our segment profit margin was 8.7% compared to 8.8% last year. This slight decline was expected and primarily reflects the impact of prior year temporary savings and the year-over-year increase in incentive compensation. Our 8.7% margin reflects a 100 basis point improvement from 2019. For the full year, segment profit was $1.7 billion, up 24% on a 14% sales increase and our segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 8.2% last year, a 60 basis point increase from 2020 and 100 basis points from 2019. This represents our strongest full year segment profit margin since 2000. So we're very pleased with the improvement in margin and the tremendous work by our teams. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.6% compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, with the decrease in rate primarily related to a geographic shift in income. For the year, our tax rate was 24.9% compared to 24.5% in the prior year and primarily due to the increase in certain international tax rates throughout the year. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations on both a reported and adjusted basis was $256 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.79. This compares to $221 million or $1.52 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year or an 18% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $899 million or $6.23 per share, and adjusted net income was $997 million or $6.91 per share, a 31% increase from 2020. So now turning to our fourth quarter results by segment. Total Automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 13% from last year. Our segment profit increased 11% to $266 million, with profit margin at 8.3%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to higher incentive compensation and the prior year benefit of temporary savings, this represents a 110 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the strong underlying progress in our operations. For the year, profit margin was 8.6% up 60 basis points from 2020 and up 100 basis points from 2019. Our Industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 13% from 2020. Our segment profit of $154 million was up 15% from a year ago, and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, up 20 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019. For the full year, profit margin for this segment is 9.4%, up 90 basis points from 2020 and up 130 basis points from 2019. So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At December 31, our total accounts receivable were up 15%, primarily due to the increase in sales and we remain pleased with the quality of our receivables. Our inventory was up 11%, a function of the sales increase and our commitment to having the right parts in the right place at the right time. Accounts payable increased 16% from 2020 due to the increase in inventory and extended payment terms with our global suppliers. Our AP-to-inventory ratio improved to 124% from 118% in the prior year. Our total debt at December 31 is $2.4 billion, down 10% from December of 2020. We closed the fourth quarter with available liquidity of $2.2 billion, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.4 times from 1.9 times in 2020. In early January this year, we issued $1 billion in new public debt in connection with the KDG acquisition. This consisted of a three-year $500 million bond at a 1.75% interest rate and 10-year $500 million bonds at a 2.75% rate. This raises our total debt to approximately $3.4 billion and our forecasted debt-to-EBITDA to 1.8 times, which is well within our targeted range and maintains our investment-grade rating. We generated $250 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, and our earnings growth and working capital drove $1.3 billion in cash from operations for the full year. Our free cash flow was $992 million. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $266 million for a broad range of investments such as supply chain projects at our distribution centers, including automation and other equipment for added efficiencies, digital initiatives and IT systems and software development. We will continue to reinvest in our business to drive organic growth and to improve the productivity in our operations in 2022. We also invested $284 million of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments primarily consisted of various automotive store groups across our geographies as well as online and Internet businesses, which provides us with expanded market coverage and a high return on investment. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both the Automotive and Industrial segments, and we look forward to the benefits of the Kaman Distribution acquisition. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948. And in 2021, we paid total cash dividends of approximately $466 million. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.58 per share annual dividend for 2022, representing our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 10% increase from the $3.26 per share paid in 2021. Additionally, we have an active share buyback program dating back to 1994. In the fourth quarter, we used $50 million to purchase 400,000 shares. And for the year, we used $334 million to purchase 2.6 million shares. As of December 31, we were authorized to repurchase up to 11.9 million shares, and we continue to be active in this program in 2022. So turning to our outlook for 2022. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 2% headwind from foreign currency translation and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, including plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales growth which is before the impact of acquisitions and FX. And a total sales increase of plus 20% to plus 22% for the Industrial segment which includes the addition of KDG and a 4% to 6% comp sales increase. On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.60 and this represents an 8% to 10% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2021. So that's my financial update. And throughout the quarter and full year, our teams were focused on driving strong sales, improved margins, exceptional cash flow, and they delivered on every count. We're thankful for all the great work by our teammates. And as we move forward in the new year, there is tremendous momentum in our businesses. We look forward to reporting on our first quarter 2022 performance in April. As Paul mentioned earlier, the April earnings call will be my last as CFO. It was a difficult decision to retire from the company that I love, but the timing was right, and we're in capable hands with a talented team in place to support Bert. He is well qualified and his experience and skills make him the right person to serve as our next CFO. I'm excited to work with Bert over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you and I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Thank you, Chris. Yeah. Happy to, look at that. When we look at Q4, and again, it was similar to what we alluded to when we came out of Q3 that it was certainly a little bit heavier in the quarter with a mid-single digit for Global Automotive and a little bit stronger, obviously, on the U.S. Automotive than International Automotive, giving us around a 3% for the full year. And it was low-single digit for Global Industrial. Again, theirs was pretty normal throughout the year. As we look ahead, we certainly see a planned carryover impact from Q3 and Q4 going into 2022. So we think first half 2022 will be similar to what we saw coming out of second half 2021. And then it moderates into the second half. So again, a bit stronger in the U.S. Automotive but -- and more normal in our international Automotive and Industrial, so you may see something like around a 3%-ish or again, a bit more than that in the U.S., and that's what we're contemplating in our 2022 numbers. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. Yes. I mean, look, Q4 -- and again, Q4 SG&A, we knew going into this quarter that we had a fair amount of headwinds. The temporary cost savings last year, roughly $40 million, mean that was almost 90 basis points on our SG&A in the quarter. The increase in incentive compensation was meaningful similar to the temporary cost savings. That was a meaningful number. And then just the normal inflationary pressures, which we called out in Q3 and continued into Q4, on wages and freight, really, freight was certainly a big headwind for us. And then, we've got investments in projects and technology supply chain. But on the tailwind side, I mean, again, I would call out our strong leverage with our strong growth and being able to leverage better than we have in the past. And then the ongoing benefit of our initiatives. So we continue to have terrific initiatives. There was a lot of puts and takes, but ultimately, we had a better year in our SG&A than what we started off with, and the teams have done a terrific job in a really tight labor market and really having to do more with less. And again, as we look ahead into 2022 and your comments, we are implying certainly operating margin improvement, and we would expect to hold on to our gross margin rate in a highly inflationary environment and have initiatives that may even bring that up a bit. And at the same time, we think we're going to get some improvement in SG&A as we go into 2022, and that's coming off of our initiatives. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes. I'll walk through that. I mean, again, as we talked about on our December conference call with KDG, I mean, the sales of roughly $1.1 billion, our guidance of 21% to 22% and the core growth of 5% to 6%, the balance of that is KDG. So we've kind of given you the 5% to 6% with KDG being the difference there. And again, similar to what we gave you in December with the EBITDA margin, again, you're talking about in the 8% to 9% range. What you have to think about, and again, I've implied that and we've got segment operating profit improvement going into next year, both with and without Kaman, when you roll it all the way down to net profit and EPS, as we've talked about earlier, you have to take into account the incremental interest expense as well as the intangible amortizations. And again, it's early in the process, obviously, the pace of synergies is the significant driver here based on where we are now and what we know, that's all sort of rolling up to roughly a $0.10 impact for this year. But again, we're only six weeks in on the synergies, really highly encouraged by what the teams are going to do. But again, we do have the implied operating margin improvement in those numbers. Thank you. Thank you, Liz. We'd like to thank you for your interest and participation in our fourth quarter and year-end earnings. We appreciate your support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to reporting out our first quarter results in April. Thank you, and have a great day."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The GPC team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, further building on the positive momentum of the first nine months of 2021. We are proud of our progress through the year and thankful to our 52,000 teammates for their hard work and ongoing commitment to excellence. With a tailwind of strong industry fundamentals, we executed on our key strategic priorities to accelerate sales, improved gross margin and enhanced operational efficiencies, which resulted in double-digit sales and earnings growth for both the quarter and full year. Our earnings growth and continued focus on working capital improvements also helped us to deliver strong cash flow. So just a tremendous effort by our global teams. They were laser-focused throughout the year and successfully navigated the ongoing challenges of the global supply chain, COVID disruptions and inflationary pressures. In early January, we successfully closed on our acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, an industrial distributor of power transmission, automation and fluid power solutions. We are integrating this highly synergistic acquisition into our Motion business to enhance our scale and further strengthen our market-leading position. We are pleased to welcome the Kaman team to GPC and we look forward to creating significant shareholder value as a premier leader in industrial solutions. Turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales were $4.8 billion, a 13% increase from last year with broad strength across all our businesses. We delivered our 17th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. These efforts led to an 18% increase in the quarter in adjusted earnings per share. Total sales for the Global Automotive Group were $3.2 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from 2020. On a comp basis, sales were up 11% from 2020 with our U.S. business posting the strongest year-over-year comps and each of our international operations achieving high single-digit sales comp. In addition, we experienced a steady sales cadence throughout the quarter with double-digit total sales increases in all three months. The ongoing economic recovery has led to strong customer demand. Improving miles driven, delays of new car production and rising used car prices are keeping more cars on the road longer, generating increased repairs and maintenance. Our strategic growth initiatives are proving effective as well. We continue to work closely with global suppliers to manage through product delays and logistical challenges to improve inventory availability. Additionally, our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales and maintain margins throughout the inflationary environment in the latter half of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we also added 130,000 SKUs to our e-catalog with the integration of Auto Accessories Garage. We were also pleased to expand our global store footprint with the addition of several bolt-on acquisitions. In total, we added more than 50 net new stores across our network, with most of these coming in the fourth quarter. Finally, as we look ahead to April, we are excited for the launch of the new AAA-branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers. Looking next, at our Automotive highlights by region. Total U.S. sales were up 15%, with comp sales up 13% from last year. In Canada, total sales were up 11% with comp sales up 9% from 2020. The growth in Canada was much improved from the third quarter as the easing of lockdowns drove strong demand throughout the end of the year. In the U.S., sales to both commercial and retail customers were up double-digits, with positive ticket and traffic counts for the fourth consecutive quarter. Likewise, sales were strong across a broad range of products with categories such as chassis, exhaust, brakes and ride control all outperforming. Our DIY business remains strong, trending well above historical growth rates for the past several quarters. While initially driven by the increase in DIY demand due to COVID, we have sustained that growth through a number of initiatives, including enhanced in-store merchandising, training and development, and the continued rollout of customer services such as AfterPay, which offers existing and new customers buy now, pay later option. This program is in 1,200 stores today and currently available for all online purchases. NAPA online B2C sales continue to be our fastest-growing sales channel, up over 40% in Q4 and 53% for the full year, a 3x increase from our 2019 volume. The strength in commercial sales was driven by high-teen growth to our major account partners and sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers were up low-teens. The surge in members continued through the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with nearly 18,000 NAPA AutoCare Centers, an increase of over 800 shops from 2020. Rounding out our commercial segments. Fleet, government and other wholesale customers posted low double-digit sales growth for the quarter, so strong results across all our commercial accounts. In Europe, our AAG team continued to perform well with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. Our team delivered solid results across each of our seven markets, with the UK and Benelux each posting 20%-plus growth. Our teams on the ground continue to expand our market share across all important key account segment as well as accelerating the rollout of NAPA-branded products. In addition, we are pleased to report our 2021 acquisitions of Winparts, an online provider of parts and accessories; and J&S, a multi-store operation based in Ireland, both are performing above expectations. In our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 11% from 2020, with comp sales up 9% from last year and up a strong 25% on a two-year stack. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well, with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by accelerated digital strategy, NAPA store expansion and the Q4 reopening of key metro markets. So now, let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 13% increase from last year, with comp sales up 12% from 2020. This is our third consecutive quarter of double-digit comps for this segment, driven by strong growth in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses. The sales cadence was consistent through the quarter with double-digit sales growth in all three months. The continued improvement in our Industrial sales trends reflects the benefits of our growth initiatives and ongoing strength of the industrial economy. Our Industrial team delivered positive sales growth across virtually all major product categories and industries we serve, including double-digit increases in the majority of our industry groups. These include sectors such as equipment and machinery, iron and steel, automotive and aggregate and cement, among others. Our Industrial team continues to execute several initiatives to drive profitable growth. Our omnichannel build-outs of accelerated e-commerce growth and is driving sales with new customers. We are encouraged by the incremental sales for our inside sales center and on motion.com. We have expanded our industrial services and value-add solutions capabilities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. And our enhanced strategy to compete in a dynamic pricing environment provides us a competitive advantage while also helping us offset inflationary pressures. Our Motion team made tremendous progress with these initiatives in the quarter and the year, and we expect to make further progress again in 2022. In addition, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our products and services offerings and expand our footprint. The added scale, presence and capabilities through the KDG acquisition is a great example, checking several boxes with its core power transmission and bearings business, and automation and fluid power industrial services and solutions. KDG's highly complementary growth and productivity strategies, product offering, and value-added services provide tremendous synergies and growth prospects. Our Motion team is actively bringing together the world-class talent and industrial expertise of these two organizations to build an even stronger business. In 2021, we remain focused on the positive impact of sustainable business practices. We updated our 2021 sustainability report, highlighting our progress in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, and reducing the environmental impact of our operations. Today, we are in process of measuring our global emissions and building a strategy for targeted improvement. We will be sharing additional highlights as we move through 2022. Finally, as most of you are probably aware, we announced last month that Carol will be retiring in May after an exceptional 30-year career. As our CFO for the pastnine years, Carol's leadership and countless contributions were integral to the significant growth and strong financial performance of the company. She will be greatly missed by all of us. We were pleased to announce that Bert Nappier will be stepping in as our next CFO. Bert is a strategic financial executive with a diverse background spanning 25 years, including the past 16 years with FedEx serving most recently as EVP Finance and Treasurer. Bert has also served as President of FedEx Express Europe and CEO of TNT Express. We are confident Bert's strong financial background along with his extensive international experience will make him a great addition to the GPC team. Carol and Bert will work together over the next few months to ensure an orderly and seamless transition. Carol will be with us for our first quarter earnings call in April, and Bert will join us on the call as well. We look forward to introducing Bert to all of you in the months ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Thank you, Carol. With the fourth quarter now behind us, we can safely say that 2021 was an exceptional year for GPC. Throughout the year, our team focused on advancing the strategic priorities for our global Automotive and industrial businesses. With the backdrop of our multiyear portfolio optimization strategy, the economic recovery and strong industry fundamentals, we generated double-digit sales and earnings growth and significantly improved our profit margin. We are proud of our strong financial performance and the many accomplishments of the GPC team. Our results drove strong cash flow, which further supported our balance sheet strength. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing for enhanced productivity and growth through capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. In total, we were pleased to effectively deploy $1.35 billion for these key priorities in 2021. So now turning to 2022, we are confident in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability as we build on the underlying momentum in both our Automotive and Industrial operations, and realize the benefits from our acquisition of KDG. We are well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined, value-creating capital allocation, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. We thank you for your interest in and support of GPC, and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering a terrific year for GPC. So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Hey, thanks, Scot. And hey, Scot, welcome back. Glad to have you back on the call. What I would tell you about US Automotive, Scot, when I go through region-by-region, first off, every region in Q4 was up double digit, which I don't recall that in a number of years. Both coasts were the strongest. When I look at the East Coast, up and down the East Coast, from Atlantic, Northeast, Southeast, all strong, West, really strong. But even that, it's hard to single out one of our regions, all were up double digits. So really, really terrific performance up and down. On the Industrial side, again, double-digit increases every month in Q4. And we really don't see much regionality on the Industrial side, either. It was, again, every region performed extremely well. And I will tell you, Scot, I couldn't be more proud of our team. In a pretty challenging environment, the increases they delivered were just outstanding. Well, I would -- I guess what I would call out, Scot, if you look and compare the US and let's call out Europe. Europe is such a dominant DIFM market, 90% to 95% of our business in Europe is DIFM. So very, very little DIY business. And as we all know, we really saw the DIY segment spike during COVID and with all the monies that were being pushed out into the marketplace to consumers. So -- but I would also tell you Scot, we're seeing a bit more supply chain challenges in US Automotive than we're seeing either in Australia or Europe. So that would certainly be a callout. But look, again, I'm really pleased to tell you that while the US Automotive group led the way, we saw once again really strong performance in both Europe and Asia Pac as well. Yes. Thanks, Scot. Yes. So let me just clarify, Chris. When you talk about the different geographies, are you talking different geographies in the US or US compared to Europe and Asia Pac? Yes. So as we look at our outlook for 2022, we're -- our expectation is we're going to continue to see solid growth across all of our markets. And I would tell you that while it's very early, we're six weeks into the year, we are seeing those trends carry over from 2021 into 2022. So -- but overall, our expectation is that we come in the year in all of our markets, somewhere in that five to seven range, which has kind of been our historical targets. So, -- but it certainly could be a bit stronger than that here in the U.S. And then your question, Chris, around DIY and DIFM -- and you mentioned it, our strength is certainly DIFM, and we had a terrific year in DIFM in 2021, both our NAPA AutoCare Center business, our major account business, our fleet business, all up double-digit. Our DIY business performed very well again. But we always remind ourselves, we're coming off a really small base. But I think some of the actions that our team has taken over the last couple of years in terms of really improving our store assortments, our store training, our hours all has really gone a long way in spiking our retail business. And we expect that to continue really strong as well. Not at all, not at all which gives me a lot of confidence as we move throughout the year. Thanks, Chris. Yeah. Sure, happy to, Evan. We -- look, we have historically had a very rational environment across the automotive aftermarket in the U.S. And honestly, we don't expect that to shift in a dramatic way one way or the other. But that said, I would tell you that our teams are always looking at prices across the markets and market dynamics, and we'll look down to the SKU level and category level. But I would tell you at this point, Evan, we're focused on our actions. We intend to take good care of our customers. And we'll continue to compete in the marketplace on certainly, our NAPA product quality, our availability and really our great people that we've got in our stores and just continuing to deliver outstanding customer service to all of our great customers. Yes. Maybe Will and I tag team that. I would just give you from a high-level view, and we were over in Europe with the team a couple of weeks ago, the NAPA rollout continues very strong. As you may know, we kicked it off in the UK a couple of years ago. And we've now rolled out a number of product categories. We continue to expand into new product categories. So we're in chassis, brakes. We're looking at launching oil, have launched oil, steering calipers, toolboxes. So we continue to expand the offering, but we're also expanding into new markets. So we've gone beyond the UK into France. We've launched now Germany, Netherlands, and continues to perform very, very well. So I don't know, Will, is there anything you would add? You're welcome. And hey, Greg, I would just add to that, that we haven't seen the degradation in supply chain on the industrial side. Our industrial fill rates have, throughout this past 18 months or so, have remained pretty good, certainly better than what we've seen on the US Automotive side. So our challenge has largely relegated to US Automotive. But as Will said, we are beginning to see an uptick in our fill rates across most of our major suppliers. And look, we know our supplier partners, they have got challenges as it relates to COVID and labor and material shortages. So they're doing all they can for us. And we do believe with our size and scale, that if anybody is going to get product in this environment, it will be Genuine Parts Company. Thanks. No, I don't think so, Seth. I mean, look, if you go back -- and I've been at this a long time in this automotive aftermarket, price has never been the primary driver in the automotive aftermarket, Seth. And as I think I mentioned earlier, we focus on just putting out a great product, a quality product, having it available when our customers want it, delivering an incredibly fast fashion, having great people on the ground. And then, yes, you've got to have a competitive price on top of it. But certainly, price is not going to be the number one driver nor has it ever been in the automotive aftermarket. Hey, Seth, I would just add to that. We are very, very encouraged what we're seeing in the early days. As Carol mentioned, we're six weeks in, but the team is out of the blocks strong. We've met with the majority of our key customers, our key suppliers in this first six weeks. The team has put an incredible amount of effort. They got a great plan in place, and we're excited with having the Kaman team as a part of GPC and we know they're going to deliver great things for us in the next few years. Thanks. Thanks, Seth. Yes. And Daniel, I'll just mention that, look, we've been on the ground with a full team in place in Shenzhen, China now for the better part of a decade. And we're sourcing product today, direct sourcing product for all of our automotive businesses around the world. We go to the same factories. We consolidate our purchases between Europe, Asia Pac and the US. So we've been there for the better part of a decade, and it's worked extremely well for us. That's correct. Yes. So Daniel, we're in seven different markets across Europe, including the UK. The UK and Benelux countries were our strongest performers in 2021. And really continue to deliver. The UK was also our initial launch point for our NAPA-branded product. So they've got a bit of a head start on the rest of Europe. All seven countries are positive, and we certainly expect that trend to continue into 2022. We've got a great team on the ground in Europe, and we're very bullish on the outlook for our business there. You bet. Thank you. Thank you, Liz."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Genuine Parts Company, Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSid Jones: Good morning.

Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report strong financial results again this quarter, which reflects the consistent execution of our strategic priorities as the global markets continue to recover. As we size up the business climate and how we are managing through the recovery, we can report the GPC team is generating positive momentum in both our sales and operating results. And we are well positioned for both near and long-term growth.  Despite inflationary pressures, our margins reflect the success of our category management initiatives in cost control efforts which have offset these increases. And finally, our strategic efforts with our global supplier partners have prevented significant shortfalls and our overall inventory levels allowing us to deliver quality customer service. Taken a look at our third quarter financial results, total sales were 4.8 billion up 10% from last year and up 11% from Q3 of 2019. We also produced our 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion.  And we further improved our productivity and customer service capabilities with the ongoing execution of our operational initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 14% and our segment margin improved 30 basis points to 9.3%. This represents our strongest margin in 2 decades and confirms our key initiatives are driving meaningful improvements. Net income was 229 million or a $1.59 for diluted share and adjusted net income was 270 million or a $1.88 per share.  This is a 15% increase from 2020 and establishes a new record for GPC's quarterly earnings, so just an outstanding job by the GPC team. Total sales for global automotive also set a new record at 3.2 billion for the quarter. This represents an 8% increase from Q3 2020, and a 15% increase from Q3 of 2019. On a comp basis, sales were up 5% from last year and up 7% on a two-year stack, with our strongest year-over-year automotive comps coming from the U.S. business.  In addition, from a cadence perspective, sales held up well through the quarter with the strongest average daily sales volume in each of our geographies coming in September. The broad strength in our global automotive sales reflects a number of factors. First, we're proud of our team's efforts to shore up our supply chain amidst the difficult backdrop of product delays and logistics challenges. Supply chain disruptions have been more substantial for U.S. automotive than in our international or industrial operations.  And we continue to work closely with our global suppliers to manage through these issues and ensure we have the right inventory available for our customers. We are confident in the effectiveness of our global sourcing team and believe we are well-positioned in the industry. We also continue to benefit from our key growth initiatives and market tailwinds. Among our growth initiatives, our emphasis on innovative sales programs and sales force effectiveness are positively impacting commercial sales.  As examples, we recently finalized an exclusive partnership in the education space for technician recruitment with over 10,000 active tech students in the process of earning their credentials. We're also excited that NAPA and AAA have executed an agreement for NAPA to be the exclusive auto parts supplier for the new AAA branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the over 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers.  We're also equipping our sales team with incremental resources, training and development, which have led to more productive, customer-facing calls. In addition, our omni -channel investments continue to drive strong B2B and B2C digital sales. And finally, the international rollout of the NAPA brand is driving significant growth in both our European and Asia-Pac operations.  So now turning to the market tailwinds, these macro drivers include the following: The ongoing reopening of the economy, and improving miles-driven which generate the need for more repairs and more maintenance. A robust used car market, that is keeping more cars on the road longer. And improving the aftermarket fundamentals, such as the growing and aging vehicle fleet, which will continue to benefit the industry over the long term.  Looking next at our automotive highlights by region, total U.S. sales were up 9%. Comp sales increased 8% from last year and are up 5% on a 2 year stack. In Canada, total sales were up 1% with comp sales essentially flat both year-over-year and on a two-year stack as lockdowns in major markets have slowed the recovery. it's been encouraging to see these restrictions of easing of late, which should lead to stronger demand through the final 3 months of 2021.  Our U.S. sales were driven by strong demand for product categories such as exhaust, ride control, brakes, tools, and equipment which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were positive for the third consecutive quarter. By customer segment, sales to both commercial and retail customers held strong, with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the second straight quarter.  We do remain pleased, however, with the continued strength of our DIY business and believe we can drive additional growth with ongoing initiatives, such as B2C digital investments. These include new search features, improving catalog functionality, and enhanced payment options, such as, buy now and pay later. NAPA online, B2C sales continue to grow at a rapid pace, up over 40% from the third quarter, and up 2x from 2019.  The strength in commercial sales in the quarter was driven by several of the initiatives mentioned earlier, as well as the ongoing economic recovery in the U.S.. Sales to our major account partners were strongest with mid-teen growth, followed by sales for our NAPA AutoCare customers, which were up low double digits. We would add that our NAPA AutoCare membership has surged with the reopening of markets and includes nearly 400 shop upgrades thus far in 2021.  So really terrific momentum for our premier independent garage program. Rounding out our commercial segments, fleet, and government and other wholesale customers, also posted high single-digit growth for the quarter. So really strong results across all of our commercial accounts. These are encouraging trends and as we look ahead, we remain confident in our growth strategy and our key priorities to deliver customer value. and ultimately sell more parts for more cars.  Our AAD team in Europe continue to perform well with total Q3 sales up 8%, were up a strong 23% on a two-year stack. Comp sales increased 2.5% from last year and were up 14% on a 2-year stack. While the UK and Benelux continue to stand out with really strong results, we were pleased with the solid results in each of our 7 European markets. A reflection of stable market conditions and execution of our key sales initiatives.  These include the continued roll-out of the NAPA brand and ongoing emphasis on key account development, which are driving market share gains. Now looking at our Asia-Pac business, total sales were up 2% from 2020 and up 18% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales were up slightly from last year and up 15% on a 2-year stack. With both commercial and retail sales up double-digit, driven by positive growth with both the Repco and NAPA brand.  We're really pleased with these results given the severe lock downs and the major markets of Sydney, Melbourne, and Auckland during much of the quarter. We're energized to see the reopening of these markets is finally getting underway, and we expect a surge in demand in the coming month. So now let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this segment were 1.6 billion, a strong 15% increase from last year, and a 5% increase from 2019. Comp sales were up 13% and up 4% on a 2-year stack.  Through the quarter, average daily sales in July and August were in line with the second quarter, while our strongest results were in the month of September. This quarter's positive momentum and industrial exceeded our expectations, which is a reflection of the great work by our motion team, and the strengthening of the industrial economy. Both the PMI and industrial production were positive for the quarter and these indicators correlate closely to the overall healthy state of the industrial sales climate.  For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth across each of our industries served. The industry's sectors that stood out with double-digit growth include our largest customers segment, equipment and machinery, as well as iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement, lumber and wood, fabricated metals, equipment rental, and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry experienced tremendous growth.  So as you can see, the current growth in our industrial business is quite broad across the markets we serve. As we have conveyed in our prior calls and in our industrial Deep Dive event on September 15, our Motion business is a market leader in the industrial distribution space in North America and Australasia. DMI team strive to be the preferred industrial solutions provider in the industries we serve. We partner with the best manufacturers in the industry to provide Tier 1 brand, our customers demand.  In addition, we are constantly broadening our product offering, as well as our service capabilities to maximize our sales potential and drive market share gains in a very large and fragmented market. With these fundamentals of our business in mind, our focus on continued profitable growth in this segment remained grounded in 5 key initiatives. An omni -channel build-out to accelerate e-commerce growth and drive sales with new customers.  As examples, Motion.com and our inside sales center, which has grown from 15 to now, 35 reps in just 6 months continue to drive incremental sales from new motion customers. The expansion of our industrial services and value-add solutions in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance, and automation.  Strategic M&A to generate significant growth in new markets and new products, and services as an industry consolidator. Enhanced strategy to create a dynamic pricing environment that provides us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And lastly, network optimization and automation to further improve our operating efficiencies and productivity. We're pleased with the progress from these initiatives, thus far, and we are excited for the opportunities ahead.  Another third quarter highlight, is the publication of our 2021 sustainability report update. Our initiatives and activities over the past year have lead to continued progress toward our goal of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. We've also taken steps to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by reducing energy and emissions while increasing recycling opportunities across the globe.  2020 tested all of us and accentuated the importance of supporting our people and our communities. We're really proud of our GPC teammates around the world for their resilience and contributions to further in our sustainability goals. We invite you to learn more about these initiatives and our full report which you can find on the GPC website. So in summary, we made great progress in several important areas during the third quarter.  And we're very pleased with the strong result in our automotive and industrial businesses, and the continued improvement in our sales and operations. We could not be more proud of the GPC team. Now, I will turn the call over to Will. Will?\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, let me reiterate Paul's comments and acknowledge the continued strong team performance this quarter. It's always a proud moment to have the opportunity to showcase our global teams hard work, relentless customer service, and winning performance. It's a challenging environment and teams have done an exceptional job to adjust and deliver results.  We continue to remain focused on our key pillars, including talent, sales effectiveness, digital supply chain, and emerging technology. Teams are executing initiatives well and consider s strategic initiatives a central part of our operating cadence. The teams have rigor around measurement and progress visibility. We measure unique global initiatives and are ahead of our 2021 plan established at the beginning of the year.  As we execute our GPC strategic planning process for the upcoming year, we reflect on learn from and refine our priority initiative execution. In addition through the year, we share best practices around the globe for common strategies to help us continuously learn and improve as one GPC team. While our geographies and end markets are diverse, we share similar GPC global initiatives, all designed to deliver profitable growth in excess of market growth, operating leverage, and free cash flow.  Despite a challenging environment, we're pleased to see more normal team activities and customer activities starting to be possible in most of our geographies. We recently had the opportunity to meet in person with the U.S. Automotive Executive and Field Management team in Atlanta. We listened to field feedback, shared performance trends, enjoyed team camaraderie, introduced new talent, and collaborated on strategic priorities for the upcoming year.  Similarly, approximately 70 of our motion Executive and field leaders from around the country, recently had the chance to meet in person for the first time since early 2020, to detail business performance and review strategic initiatives priorities. In Europe, our AAG executive leadership team recently met together in person for the first time in nearly 2 years.  Our Atlanta-based GPC and U.S. NAPA field support teams also hosted an employee appreciation event for 400 teammates, that included a well-received visit from our celebrity NAPA racing teammates, including Chase Elliott. We're cautiously optimistic our teams in Australasia will soon be able to exit lockdown in November and also return to a more normal in-person routine.  At each of these events, it's energizing to see the positive attitudes, strong team alignment, and visible excitement about our GPC momentum and vision. It's also reassuring to see our differentiated GPC culture up close and intact. Paul and I have also had the opportunity to spend time in person with customers and vendors this quarter. These discussions are critically important as we share our growth visions, listen to feedback, and explore ways to deepen our strategic partnership.  These conversations not only reinforce our GPC core strategic priorities, talent, sales effectiveness, digital and tech, supply chain and emerging tech; b but also always affirm the unique customer value propositions across our GPC businesses. Growth, technology solutions, supply chain excellence, products and technical expertise, and long-standing local relationships are always key themes.  As an example, we recently visited with an industrial customer who is enjoying exponential growth. Our Motion teammates co-locate associates at the customer facility to provide real-time expertise on the plant floor to ensure the facility is operating to its potential. Part of the discussions with this customer explored the use of embedded technology solutions that will make customer ordering from motion easier and faster.  We're building plans to triple the size of this customer relationship over the next few years. In our customer discussions or recent common theme is the supply chain challenges that face all Company. We explained, we believe our global scale in-country resources, data and analytics, investments in our supply chain, strategic inventory actions, and proactive daily team approach, position as to navigate the headwinds relative to others. We're in constant discussion with highest levels of our supplier partners, many of which for whom GPC represents a large and important global customer.  Over the past quarter, we've held numerous top-to-top meetings with our global executive leadership and vendor partners to review progress and jointly problems solved. It's a challenging environment, but our global teams and partners are proactively acting each day to navigate it. Turning to our focus on talent, we recently completed an end-to-end strategic review of our global GPC employee value proposition, and talent initiatives.  This disciplined work ensures we have the right capabilities aligned to our current and future business strategies. The work also ensures we're constantly striving to be an employer of choice in this dynamic and competitive talent environment. Around the globe, we continue to take deliberate actions to lead, recognize and ensure the well-being of our teams.  For example, we recently streamlined recruiting processes to move faster to attract talent, introduce new wellness incentives, improved holiday schedules, enhance vacation eligibility and flexibility, invested in healthcare costs to reduce the burden on our associates, improve tuition reimbursement programs, and relaxed dress code policies to name a few. And talent's our most important advantage, we'll always work to take care of and invest in our people.  We also continued to execute well against our broader digital and technology initiatives. During the quarter, the teams have made exciting progress under leadership of our new Chief Information and Digital Officer, Naveen Krishna. We're focused on building high performing teams that engineered technology to solve customers problems at scale. In addition, we'll optimize human and financial resources to focus on the most critical and impactful activities.  Our emerging technology initiatives, including electric vehicles and related technologies also continue to advance. The global teams are partnering well to execute a disciplined and coordinated strategy. We're pleased with the team momentum and will continue to dedicate resources to this exciting effort.  Last, the teams are executing our M&A strategy with discipline. For example, we added several store groups to our North American and Europe an automotive network to increase local market density and we announced the acquisition of J&S Automotive Distributors, a leading automotive parts distributor in Ireland. This new geography represents the 15th country in which GPC operates. In addition, we were pleased to recently sign a definitive agreement to acquire AutoAccessoriesGarage, a leading U.S. based digital platform specializing in automotive accessories.  This strategic digital acquisition adds new capabilities and accelerates a strategic product category for the U.S. automotive team. The acquisition pipeline is active and we remain disciplined to prioritize transactions we believe meet all of our GPC strategic and financial criterion. We are thrilled to welcome our newest teammate to the global GPC family. Overall, we are really pleased with the record -setting team performance.  Despite uncontrollable headwind, the teams continue to rally together each day to service customers and deliver performance. We look forward to working hard to close the year strong and build on our solid momentum as we move forward into 2022. With that, I will now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you. Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you. Recapping revenues, total GPC sales were 4.8 billion in the third quarter, up 10%. Gross margin improved to 35.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from 35.0%, last year.  Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes and the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. In the third quarter, we had continued pricing activity with our suppliers as anticipated, resulting in additional product cost inflation. Our team was positioned to address these increases with effective pricing and global sourcing strategies and price inflation improve neutral to gross margin.  On a total Company basis, we estimate a 3% inflationary impact on Q3 sales, consisting of 3.5% inflation in global automotive, and 1% to 2% in industrial. Based on current trends, we expect to see additional price inflation in the fourth quarter, and we will utilize our strategies to protect our gross margin as appropriate. Our total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 1.35 billion in the third quarter, up 11% from 2020 and at 28% of sales.  The increase from last year is due to several factors, including the prior-year benefit of approximately 60 million and temporary savings related to the pandemic. Additionally, our third quarter expenses reflect the increase in variable costs on the 450 million in additional year-over-year sales, as well as cost pressures in areas such as wages, Incentive compensation flight, rent, and health insurance. We continue to execute on our ongoing initiatives to control expenses and improve our operations.  While pleased with our progress, thus far, we see room for further improvement in the quarters ahead. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was 447 million up 14%. Our segment profit margin was 9.3% compared to 9.0% last year, a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement, and up a 130 basis points from 2019. So we're really pleased with the continued improvement and the excellent work by our team.  Looking ahead, we raised our margin expectations for the full year and we currently expect segment profit margin to improve 40 to 50 basis points from 2020 or 80 to 90 basis points from 2019. This would be our strongest full year margin in more than 20 years. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9% on an adjusted basis, up from 23.4% last year, with the increase in rate primarily related to income mix shift to higher tax jurisdictions.  Our third quarter net income from continuing operations was 229 million, with diluted earnings per share of a $1.59. Our adjusted net income was 270 million or a $1.88 per diluted share, which compares to 237 million or a $1.63 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, a 15% increase. So turning to our third quarter results by segment, our total automotive revenue was 3.2 billion up 8% from last year.  Our segment profit increased 6% to 281 million with profit margin as solid 8.8%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to the prior-year benefit of temporary savings, this represents an 80 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the underlying progress in our operations. For the 9 months profit margin is 8.6% up 80 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019, driven primarily by margin expansion in our U.S. and European operations. Our industrial sales were 1.6 billion up 15% from 2020. Segment profit of a 166 million was up a strong 32% from a year ago and profit margin improved to a 10.3%. This is a 140 basis points from 2020 and up 220 basis points from 2019 and the first double-digit margin for industrial since the Fourth Quarter of 2006. Year-to-date profit margin for this segment is 9.4% up a 120 basis points from 2020 and up a 150 basis points from 2019. So this group is executing very well and posting excellent operating results through the industrial recovery. So now, let's turn our comments to the balance sheet.  At September 30th, total accounts receivable is down 3.5%, primarily due to the timing of the 300 million in accounts receivables sold in October of 2020. Inventory was up 10% in line with our sales increase and a reflection of our commitment to having the right parts, in the right place, at the right time. Accounts payable increased 20% from last year due to the increase in inventory and favorable payment terms with certain suppliers. Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 118% last year.  Our total debt is 2.4 billion down 474 million or 16% from September of last year, and down 245 million from December 31 of 2020. We closed the third quarter with available liquidity of 2.4 billion and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.5 times from 2.2 times last year. So our teams continue to do an outstanding job of optimizing our working capital and our capital structure. We also continue to generate strong cash flow with another 300 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and 1 billion for the 9 months. For the full year.  We expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion in cash from operations. And free cash flow of 950 million to 1.15 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. For the 9 months we have invested a 138 million in capital expenditures, and we have plans for additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations through the balance of the year.  In addition, we have used approximately a 143 million in cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments includes several automotive store groups across our markets, included in the entry into Ireland discussed earlier. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both automotive and industrial segments.  This would include Auto Accessories Garage as mentioned before, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our longstanding dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than 349 million to our shareholders through the 9 months. The Company has paid a dividend every year since going public in 1948 and has increased the dividend for 65 consecutive years.  And as part of our share repurchase program, we have also been active with share buybacks dating back to 1994. In the third quarter, we used a $100 million to purchase 800,000 shares, and year-to-date we have used 284 million to purchase 2.2 million shares. The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 12.2 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead.  So turning to our current outlook for 2021, we are raising our full-year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on July 22nd of 2021. We expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of +12 to +13%, an increase from our previous guidance of +10 to +12%. As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to +14 to +15 total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from +11 to +13% and a total sales increase of +10 to +11% for the industrial segment. An increase + plus 6% to +8% On the earnings side, we're raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.60 to $6.65, which is up 25% to 26% from 2020.  This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $6.20 to $6.35. So we're encouraged by the strength in our financial results for the third quarter and the nine months. And we enter the fourth quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed our outlook for the year. We look forward to reporting on our financial performance for the fourth quarter in full year in February. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. As we close out another strong quarter, we are pleased with our progress in driving profitable growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder We attribute the positive momentum in our business to our global team work and disciplined focus across all of our operations. Our team has confidence in the strategic plans we have put in place to capture long-term growth and margin expansion.  Our strategic plans combined with an exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments at organic and acquisitive growth. While also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So as we look ahead, we are encouraged to see the impact of the global pandemic subsiding. while the fundamentals of our two global businesses remained rock solid.  Our GPC teams around the world are stepping up under challenging circumstances and taking great care of our customers. That we thank you for your interest in GPC. and we thank each of our GPC teammates for their passion, their dedication, and their hard work. So with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Horvers of JP Morgan, please state your question.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nCarol Yancey: Good morning.\nChris Horvers: My first question is, you talked about September being the best average daily volume in the automotive business and obviously Motion has a very strong two-year acceleration. So can you talk about the potential outcomes on the fourth quarter on the comps in both businesses and given that commentary, would you expect that the two-year trend could accelerate in the fourth quarter on comps?\nPaul Donahue: Well, Chris, first off, thanks for your question. You've hit it when you look across all of our businesses, the quarter the third quarter got stronger as we progressed with September being our strongest month. And what we can tell you is that the trends that we saw in September are carrying over into the month of October.  So we're feeling good about where we are. And we certainly feel really good about the projections that we put out there for Q4. So yeah, right now everything is looking pretty solid.\nChris Horvers: Excellent. And then, Carol, can you diagnose maybe the 50 basis points of gross margin expansion? Some of that -- it was vendor allowance -- some of those vendor allowance, some of those are vendor allowance, some are pricing. How much of that is perhaps not sustainable on the vendor allowance side, and then how does that sort of parlay into your views about Motion's operating margin over time? Thank you.\nCarol Yancey: I Know, look, we couldn't be more proud of the team and the work that was done in gross margin, I really want to give thanks to our procurement teams and all of our teams because there has been a ton of efforts related to gross margin. So when we think about the inflationary impacts and having to deal with that, but honestly our initiatives, category management initiatives, global sourcing, pricing strategy.  It was vendor allowances, but quite honestly, in addition to that and especially when you look at the year-to-date numbers, it is the benefit -- the ongoing benefit of all our category management initiatives, which includes pricing and global sourcing. So I think in the quarter you did have more of an impact related to volume incentives. But I think again, taking into account everything and inflation quite honestly was neutral to our rate.  So as we look ahead, we're not concerned about gross margin in Q4. And in fact, contemplated in our guidance and our outlook is that we would continue to have a positive impact in Q4, which would have us be positive for the year and then also extremely positive on a 2-year stack basis.\nChris Horvers: And then on the motion operating margin?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. The motion operating margin, I think where you see them through the 9 months, which just, again, incredible operating performance for them. And it is both gross margin and expense leverage. And they have really permanently lowered their cost structure, but I think we will see continued improvement in Q4, for the Industrial operating margin and that would give them, sort of an implied 80 to 90 BPS improvement for the full year, which is just outstanding, and again, much stronger than that on a two-year stack basis.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks so much. And have a great fourth quarter.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Chris.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please state your question.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nCarol Yancey: Morning.\nPaul Donahue: Hi, Bret.\nBret Jordan: You commented about share gains in Automotive and, I guess, as it relates to the U.S-- are you seeing the share shift sort of smaller WDs giving up share or are there real shifts amongst the larger players in the space?\nPaul Donahue: I'll take a shot at that Bret, thanks to your question, it's -- look it's hard to say where we're gaining this year. I can tell you with some of the product category that we look at and the growth that we're seeing in Q3. And on top of a really solid Q2, we have to be up outpacing the general market. But we're also the first one out, Bret, so we'll see what the numbers look like here going forward. Bottom line is, as we all know, the automotive aftermarket is incredibly fragmented.  We like where we're at, we like the performance by our NAPA team and they had a terrific quarter and actually had terrific back-to-back quarters. And as I mentioned in the initial question, we're out of the gates in great shape in the month of October, so we expect that to continue. And I would also comment Bret that, we feel the same way about our international automotive businesses in our European team as well as our Asia-Pac team continue to perform at a high level.\nWill Stengel: And I guess my follow-up question relates to the European team, I guess, what you are saying is you rolled out the NAPA private label program in Europe, is that gaining traction? And maybe you could give us a feeling for how the margin benefit of private label looks over there.\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, I'll touch on the acceptance part, maybe Carol you weigh in on the margins. The acceptance Bret, I have to tell you is beyond our expectation, so much so that we are accelerating our -- the number of product lines. And we're accelerating the pace with which we're rolling those out. So as you look across our European aftermarket business, we really started in the UK and our UK business continues to outperform. And now we've rolled that out into the other market. And I have to tell you it's really surpassed our expectation. So really pleased and I would also say we are rolling it out in Australia and New Zealand as well with similar results.\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. So on the margin standpoint, the product labels, specifically for Europe is neutral to their gross margin rate. Having said that it is favorable from a working capital standpoint, because many of the private label comes with extended terms. So the team has been able to see the benefit of that. And in turn, they're taking their working capital improvements in reinvesting an additional product offerings and additional M&A such as [Indiscernible] that Paul and Will talked about earlier.\nBret Jordan: What do you say, as a percentage of your inventory mix being private label over there?\nCarol Yancey: We haven't really given that out yet. I mean, it's starting off slow with a number of product lines and we haven't given out a target. It's not going to be something. It's not ever going to be like what you see, certainly in the U.S. but going to a 10% and incremental improvement year-on-year out. I think you can expect that.\nBret Jordan: All right, thanks. if you, Brent, if you go back in time, Brent, when we first went into Europe back in 2017, there was very little, if any, private brands have sold through the AAG network. So everything that we're moving through right now and the NAPA brand is all incremental. And as Carol said, we're targeting 10%. We think that's a good number, but we could certainly increase that in the years ahead as we expand into new product categories.\nBret Jordan: Great, thank you.\nPaul Donahue: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. My first one was on inflation. The 3% that you saw in third quarter sales. What should that accelerate to or doesn't need to accelerate into the fourth quarter to keep it neutral on a margin standpoint?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. We think that fourth quarter is probably in the 3 to 4% range. We would say that that would be 3 to 4% for our Global Automotive and 1 to 2% for industrial. It's slightly higher on the us automotive than it is on international automotive. Then Greg, having said that and again, I couldn't be more pleased with our teams. They are doing a tremendous job and we do not think despite having incremental inflation coming in Q4, we're confident in our ability to manage through that and be able to continue to deliver gross margin improvements.\nGreg Melich: And has there been any shift in mix or any demand destruction. This is accepted by the customer?\nCarol Yancey: Well, Greg. I guess just generally what we would say when you look at our top-line results and you look at the strong demand, whether it's industrial or automotive. I mean, at this point, we haven't seen the push back, and part of it is the nature of our business that is non-discretionary. So we haven't seen necessarily the push back, pricing has stayed rational and inflations in all sectors, all industries. So really haven't seen that yet.\nGreg Melich: Got it. Make sense. And then the second was a little more strategic. Will, you talked about the M&A out there and some of the strategic things you've added. I know, historically, you guys have had a nice model paying 8 times EBITDA for things and getting some synergies and then rolling it in. What's the current environment now in terms of just finding the right opportunities and paying what you are used to paying for acquisitions?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Greg. It's a good question. Thanks for it. It is certainly a dynamic M&A market. I think as we alluded to, we have a very disciplined approach to thinking about deals. Whether it's financially, operationally, strategically, etc. And for us, it's all about the value creation potential.  And I think on our Industrial Conference, I made a comment talking about creating value so that the eight or nine times becomes something lower than that. And so that's how we think about [Indiscernible]. What does this business look like? And how much value can we create when we bring it into the GPC family. Greg, I would also add on to that one. When we look at our bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive space, whether it's in Europe or here across North America. Those continue to be very reasonable and rational, and are very close to our historic kind of valuations. But as Will said, we'll -- we will continue to be incredibly disciplined as we look at M&A here going forward.\nGreg Melich: That's a great summary. So thanks, congrats to you all and good luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks.\nWill Stengel: Thank you Greg.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you\nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens.\nDaniel Imbro: Thanks for taking my question. This is Andrew on for Daniel. So on the industrial side of the business, September PMI stepped up a bit. It's a nice surprise. How are you -- are you able to meet the demand in the market today? Have you had any issues with the risk?\nPaul Donahue: Our industrial business has held up -- well, you see the numbers Andrew that our industrial numbers are as strong as they've ever been. We had a terrific -- the team had a terrific Q3. We're not seeing that type of supply chain disruptions on the industrial side as we're seeing across the automotive -- North America automotive sector.  So they are in good shape, not to mention our industrial team going into 2021 did not trim back their inventories. They were in a good place, an inventory. And that is largely held up throughout the course of the year which has led to that great sales increase, they popped in Q3. So all is good on the industrial front.\nDaniel Imbro: Excellent. On the call through, you mentioned adding in some buy now pay later. Is that something you are just rolling out on the DIY side or do you see an opportunity to maybe roll that out to the DIFM channel to help out with affordability on repairs?\nWill Stengel: Yes, it's a great question. It's mostly on the DIY side and it's early days with the pilots that we're testing, but I'll tell you, is a good example of kind of understanding and listening to the customer, and then coming up with some solutions that meet these needs. So it's early days, but online retail is probably the place where that's most relevant.\nDaniel Imbro: Perfect. Thanks. That's all from me.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please state your question.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. And good morning. My question is on the U.S. Auto business and acceleration and growth that you saw in September, was that just a function of the comparison or is there something else that might have driven the acceleration in September and into October?\nPaul Donahue: Well, I would tell you, Seth, that I think it's a combination of factors. I think our U.S. automotive team continues to get their legs under them. The year, continues to get better as we go. I mentioned October is looking strong. It's looking strong across all regions of the country. It's looking strong in both DIY and DIFM.  And we don't -- we don't see it slowing. I would also comment that we had our best month, our best quarter with our big partners on the major accounts side, our AutoCare business continued strong and, Seth, our DIY business continues strong. So it's really across the board, it's held up well and we're seeing that trend continue on the month of October as well.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And just as a follow-up, when you think about new customer growth, have you seen an acceleration there or is it more about growing business with existing customers and the major accounts and NAPA AutoCare?\nPaul Donahue: It's really both Seth and I. And again, I would give our team high marks on the strategy they put together going into 2021, which was all around sales team effectiveness and putting more sales reps out on the street and getting them focused on the end-user customer. And even when you look at our So kind of what we deem as our all other wholesale business, which is a significant chunk of business that was up high single-digits, year-over-year.  So I think a combination of growing business with existing customers, but also kind of restructuring our approach to the customers with our sales team and really driving a lot of new business as well. So very pleased with the NAPA team and where we find ourselves.\nSeth Basham: Great to hear. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Seth.\nOperator: Our next question is from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America, please state your question.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thanks for fitting in my question. So Will had mentioned a number of enhancements to employee benefits with a focus on being a global employer of choice. Can you quantify the cost of these initiatives? Or if you can't, explicitly break out how much you think SG&A would be impacted, do you think it's fair to say that growth in wages and benefits is likely to be elevated compared to historical growth rates for the foreseeable future?\nCarol Yancey: I guess I would comment and again, these are just great things they're really important to our teammates and they are important for the work force. And yet having said that, they don't come with significant costs. I mean, what we would point to that is just more relevant on the SG&A is just the true labor and wage inflation that we're seeing. Part of it is making sure that you have competitive benefit programs and things like that, we've talked about healthcare and some of those things, paid time off vacation.  But I think more important and more significant is just the true wage inflation that we're seeing. Having said that though, we couldn't be more pleased with the team's hard work in really permanently reducing our cost structure and being able to offset a lot of that inflationary impact with some of our initiatives. So I would not say that you need a model anything in there for the incremental benefit of those types of programs. And all that is contemplated in our full-year operating margin improvement that we've kind of models. So we feel good about it going forward.\nLiz Suzuki: Got it. Then on a follow-up to that, just given the increase in the guidance for the year, I'd imagine that the quarter came in ahead of your expectations and that there are some encouraging leading indicators that make you feel increasingly optimistic about the fourth quarter. So I'm curious where the results have most surprised to the upside versus your prior estimates.\nCarol Yancey: Yeah. I think look there weren't any major surprises. Our results were really due to the stronger sales and continued recovery in automotive and industrial. The 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin gains with a highly inflationary environment, but having cost controls to really drive improved margins was important. We had terrific cash flow in the quarter, and again, with all the supply chain disruptions.  So having that higher volume and really the industrial recovery has been coming quicker each quarter. So that went into our thinking as we look at the rest of the year, but we feel really good about Q4. But again, it's been a great team effort. And I think as we've seen each quarter, recoveries and the reopening of economies and the fundamentals have gotten better each quarter.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Our last question comes from David Bellinger of Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nDavid Bellinger: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. And very nice results today. To on -- the 350 basis points of inflationary benefits within Automotive, you're expecting a similar rate in Q4. Are there any -- are the majority of those price increases fully rolled out at this point, or is there still some room to go into next year? Are you taking any pricing actions that are different from your competitors at this point?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, look, I mean it's a very fluid environment with these price increases. I mean, as they're presented to us and again, the global sourcing and supply chain and procurement teams work very closely with the vendors and they look at timing and we look at areas that we can have time to work into those price increases. We look at accelerating purchases. I mean, there's a lot of work that's being done and the timing of when they go to market is a factor in that as well.  There will be some that carries over. Brenda next year, certainly, but it's a day-to-day, week-to-week negotiation right now. It is more normal inflation and industrial, so keep that in mind, the 1 to 2% is just more normal inflation for them. It's really the us automotive that's got the heightened inflation. Again international automotive a little more normal. We will have some that goes into next year. But again, teams are doing great job to work through that and have improvement.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. And then I also want to ask buy now pay later feature. Is there any way you could frame the potential size of that opportunity? Is it really aimed at widening the NAPA customer base in some way? And just given that initiative and the acquisition you announced today, are you expecting that elevated online percentage of the business remains peaking in the coming years?\nPaul Donahue: I'll take a shot at the first part of that. David, the Buy Now, Pay Later pilot, we're in about 250 NAPA stores. And look, I give our team credit for jumping on the opportunity. It's so early yet. It's -- I would misspeak if I tried to put a number to it. It's something new. We'd never done it before. We're not doing it anywhere else in the world at this point. I would just tell you kind of stay tuned and certainly more to come on that initiative.  And then I'm sorry, the second part of your question online. Certainly, the acquisition that was announced, Automotive Accessories Garage, we're excited about that acquisition and it really goes hand-in-hand, David, with recent strategies where we acquired wind parts in Europe, we acquired spares parts in Australia, a few years back. And it's really just broadening our knowledge base and expertise into all things online.  I would certainly expect that this initiative here in the U.S. will follow in a same track that we've done in the international markets. And I'm very pleased to tell you that, they have exceeded our expectations. It's still early at wind parts in Europe, but I would tell you that, early results are very, very, very favorable. And we expect to see the same as we really just expand our knowledge base in selling products online.\nDavid Bellinger: Great. Thank you very much.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. We look forward to updating you on our year-end and fourth quarter results in February, and thank you for your support.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, let me reiterate Paul's comments and acknowledge the continued strong team performance this quarter. It's always a proud moment to have the opportunity to showcase our global teams hard work, relentless customer service, and winning performance. It's a challenging environment and teams have done an exceptional job to adjust and deliver results.  We continue to remain focused on our key pillars, including talent, sales effectiveness, digital supply chain, and emerging technology. Teams are executing initiatives well and consider s strategic initiatives a central part of our operating cadence. The teams have rigor around measurement and progress visibility. We measure unique global initiatives and are ahead of our 2021 plan established at the beginning of the year.  As we execute our GPC strategic planning process for the upcoming year, we reflect on learn from and refine our priority initiative execution. In addition through the year, we share best practices around the globe for common strategies to help us continuously learn and improve as one GPC team. While our geographies and end markets are diverse, we share similar GPC global initiatives, all designed to deliver profitable growth in excess of market growth, operating leverage, and free cash flow.  Despite a challenging environment, we're pleased to see more normal team activities and customer activities starting to be possible in most of our geographies. We recently had the opportunity to meet in person with the U.S. Automotive Executive and Field Management team in Atlanta. We listened to field feedback, shared performance trends, enjoyed team camaraderie, introduced new talent, and collaborated on strategic priorities for the upcoming year.  Similarly, approximately 70 of our motion Executive and field leaders from around the country, recently had the chance to meet in person for the first time since early 2020, to detail business performance and review strategic initiatives priorities. In Europe, our AAG executive leadership team recently met together in person for the first time in nearly 2 years.  Our Atlanta-based GPC and U.S. NAPA field support teams also hosted an employee appreciation event for 400 teammates, that included a well-received visit from our celebrity NAPA racing teammates, including Chase Elliott. We're cautiously optimistic our teams in Australasia will soon be able to exit lockdown in November and also return to a more normal in-person routine.  At each of these events, it's energizing to see the positive attitudes, strong team alignment, and visible excitement about our GPC momentum and vision. It's also reassuring to see our differentiated GPC culture up close and intact. Paul and I have also had the opportunity to spend time in person with customers and vendors this quarter. These discussions are critically important as we share our growth visions, listen to feedback, and explore ways to deepen our strategic partnership.  These conversations not only reinforce our GPC core strategic priorities, talent, sales effectiveness, digital and tech, supply chain and emerging tech; b but also always affirm the unique customer value propositions across our GPC businesses. Growth, technology solutions, supply chain excellence, products and technical expertise, and long-standing local relationships are always key themes.  As an example, we recently visited with an industrial customer who is enjoying exponential growth. Our Motion teammates co-locate associates at the customer facility to provide real-time expertise on the plant floor to ensure the facility is operating to its potential. Part of the discussions with this customer explored the use of embedded technology solutions that will make customer ordering from motion easier and faster.  We're building plans to triple the size of this customer relationship over the next few years. In our customer discussions or recent common theme is the supply chain challenges that face all Company. We explained, we believe our global scale in-country resources, data and analytics, investments in our supply chain, strategic inventory actions, and proactive daily team approach, position as to navigate the headwinds relative to others. We're in constant discussion with highest levels of our supplier partners, many of which for whom GPC represents a large and important global customer.  Over the past quarter, we've held numerous top-to-top meetings with our global executive leadership and vendor partners to review progress and jointly problems solved. It's a challenging environment, but our global teams and partners are proactively acting each day to navigate it. Turning to our focus on talent, we recently completed an end-to-end strategic review of our global GPC employee value proposition, and talent initiatives.  This disciplined work ensures we have the right capabilities aligned to our current and future business strategies. The work also ensures we're constantly striving to be an employer of choice in this dynamic and competitive talent environment. Around the globe, we continue to take deliberate actions to lead, recognize and ensure the well-being of our teams.  For example, we recently streamlined recruiting processes to move faster to attract talent, introduce new wellness incentives, improved holiday schedules, enhance vacation eligibility and flexibility, invested in healthcare costs to reduce the burden on our associates, improve tuition reimbursement programs, and relaxed dress code policies to name a few. And talent's our most important advantage, we'll always work to take care of and invest in our people.  We also continued to execute well against our broader digital and technology initiatives. During the quarter, the teams have made exciting progress under leadership of our new Chief Information and Digital Officer, Naveen Krishna. We're focused on building high performing teams that engineered technology to solve customers problems at scale. In addition, we'll optimize human and financial resources to focus on the most critical and impactful activities.  Our emerging technology initiatives, including electric vehicles and related technologies also continue to advance. The global teams are partnering well to execute a disciplined and coordinated strategy. We're pleased with the team momentum and will continue to dedicate resources to this exciting effort.  Last, the teams are executing our M&A strategy with discipline. For example, we added several store groups to our North American and Europe an automotive network to increase local market density and we announced the acquisition of J&S Automotive Distributors, a leading automotive parts distributor in Ireland. This new geography represents the 15th country in which GPC operates. In addition, we were pleased to recently sign a definitive agreement to acquire AutoAccessoriesGarage, a leading U.S. based digital platform specializing in automotive accessories.  This strategic digital acquisition adds new capabilities and accelerates a strategic product category for the U.S. automotive team. The acquisition pipeline is active and we remain disciplined to prioritize transactions we believe meet all of our GPC strategic and financial criterion. We are thrilled to welcome our newest teammate to the global GPC family. Overall, we are really pleased with the record -setting team performance.  Despite uncontrollable headwind, the teams continue to rally together each day to service customers and deliver performance. We look forward to working hard to close the year strong and build on our solid momentum as we move forward into 2022. With that, I will now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details. And I guess my follow-up question relates to the European team, I guess, what you are saying is you rolled out the NAPA private label program in Europe, is that gaining traction? And maybe you could give us a feeling for how the margin benefit of private label looks over there. Thank you Greg. Yes, it's a great question. It's mostly on the DIY side and it's early days with the pilots that we're testing, but I'll tell you, is a good example of kind of understanding and listening to the customer, and then coming up with some solutions that meet these needs. So it's early days, but online retail is probably the place where that's most relevant."

            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you. Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter financial performance and we look forward to sharing a few additional details with you. Recapping revenues, total GPC sales were 4.8 billion in the third quarter, up 10%. Gross margin improved to 35.5%, an increase of 50 basis points from 35.0%, last year.  Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives due to improved volumes and the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives. In the third quarter, we had continued pricing activity with our suppliers as anticipated, resulting in additional product cost inflation. Our team was positioned to address these increases with effective pricing and global sourcing strategies and price inflation improve neutral to gross margin.  On a total Company basis, we estimate a 3% inflationary impact on Q3 sales, consisting of 3.5% inflation in global automotive, and 1% to 2% in industrial. Based on current trends, we expect to see additional price inflation in the fourth quarter, and we will utilize our strategies to protect our gross margin as appropriate. Our total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 1.35 billion in the third quarter, up 11% from 2020 and at 28% of sales.  The increase from last year is due to several factors, including the prior-year benefit of approximately 60 million and temporary savings related to the pandemic. Additionally, our third quarter expenses reflect the increase in variable costs on the 450 million in additional year-over-year sales, as well as cost pressures in areas such as wages, Incentive compensation flight, rent, and health insurance. We continue to execute on our ongoing initiatives to control expenses and improve our operations.  While pleased with our progress, thus far, we see room for further improvement in the quarters ahead. Our total segment profit in the third quarter was 447 million up 14%. Our segment profit margin was 9.3% compared to 9.0% last year, a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement, and up a 130 basis points from 2019. So we're really pleased with the continued improvement and the excellent work by our team.  Looking ahead, we raised our margin expectations for the full year and we currently expect segment profit margin to improve 40 to 50 basis points from 2020 or 80 to 90 basis points from 2019. This would be our strongest full year margin in more than 20 years. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9% on an adjusted basis, up from 23.4% last year, with the increase in rate primarily related to income mix shift to higher tax jurisdictions.  Our third quarter net income from continuing operations was 229 million, with diluted earnings per share of a $1.59. Our adjusted net income was 270 million or a $1.88 per diluted share, which compares to 237 million or a $1.63 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, a 15% increase. So turning to our third quarter results by segment, our total automotive revenue was 3.2 billion up 8% from last year.  Our segment profit increased 6% to 281 million with profit margin as solid 8.8%. While down 20 basis points from 2020 due to the prior-year benefit of temporary savings, this represents an 80 basis point margin improvement over 2019 and reflects the underlying progress in our operations. For the 9 months profit margin is 8.6% up 80 basis points from 2020 and up 90 basis points from 2019, driven primarily by margin expansion in our U.S. and European operations. Our industrial sales were 1.6 billion up 15% from 2020. Segment profit of a 166 million was up a strong 32% from a year ago and profit margin improved to a 10.3%. This is a 140 basis points from 2020 and up 220 basis points from 2019 and the first double-digit margin for industrial since the Fourth Quarter of 2006. Year-to-date profit margin for this segment is 9.4% up a 120 basis points from 2020 and up a 150 basis points from 2019. So this group is executing very well and posting excellent operating results through the industrial recovery. So now, let's turn our comments to the balance sheet.  At September 30th, total accounts receivable is down 3.5%, primarily due to the timing of the 300 million in accounts receivables sold in October of 2020. Inventory was up 10% in line with our sales increase and a reflection of our commitment to having the right parts, in the right place, at the right time. Accounts payable increased 20% from last year due to the increase in inventory and favorable payment terms with certain suppliers. Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 118% last year.  Our total debt is 2.4 billion down 474 million or 16% from September of last year, and down 245 million from December 31 of 2020. We closed the third quarter with available liquidity of 2.4 billion and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.5 times from 2.2 times last year. So our teams continue to do an outstanding job of optimizing our working capital and our capital structure. We also continue to generate strong cash flow with another 300 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and 1 billion for the 9 months. For the full year.  We expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion in cash from operations. And free cash flow of 950 million to 1.15 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, share repurchases and the dividend. For the 9 months we have invested a 138 million in capital expenditures, and we have plans for additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations through the balance of the year.  In addition, we have used approximately a 143 million in cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth. These investments includes several automotive store groups across our markets, included in the entry into Ireland discussed earlier. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions in both automotive and industrial segments.  This would include Auto Accessories Garage as mentioned before, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our longstanding dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than 349 million to our shareholders through the 9 months. The Company has paid a dividend every year since going public in 1948 and has increased the dividend for 65 consecutive years.  And as part of our share repurchase program, we have also been active with share buybacks dating back to 1994. In the third quarter, we used a $100 million to purchase 800,000 shares, and year-to-date we have used 284 million to purchase 2.2 million shares. The Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 12.2 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead.  So turning to our current outlook for 2021, we are raising our full-year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on July 22nd of 2021. We expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of +12 to +13%, an increase from our previous guidance of +10 to +12%. As usual, this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to +14 to +15 total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from +11 to +13% and a total sales increase of +10 to +11% for the industrial segment. An increase + plus 6% to +8% On the earnings side, we're raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.60 to $6.65, which is up 25% to 26% from 2020.  This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $6.20 to $6.35. So we're encouraged by the strength in our financial results for the third quarter and the nine months. And we enter the fourth quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed our outlook for the year. We look forward to reporting on our financial performance for the fourth quarter in full year in February. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Good morning. I Know, look, we couldn't be more proud of the team and the work that was done in gross margin, I really want to give thanks to our procurement teams and all of our teams because there has been a ton of efforts related to gross margin. So when we think about the inflationary impacts and having to deal with that, but honestly our initiatives, category management initiatives, global sourcing, pricing strategy.  It was vendor allowances, but quite honestly, in addition to that and especially when you look at the year-to-date numbers, it is the benefit -- the ongoing benefit of all our category management initiatives, which includes pricing and global sourcing. So I think in the quarter you did have more of an impact related to volume incentives. But I think again, taking into account everything and inflation quite honestly was neutral to our rate.  So as we look ahead, we're not concerned about gross margin in Q4. And in fact, contemplated in our guidance and our outlook is that we would continue to have a positive impact in Q4, which would have us be positive for the year and then also extremely positive on a 2-year stack basis. Yeah. The motion operating margin, I think where you see them through the 9 months, which just, again, incredible operating performance for them. And it is both gross margin and expense leverage. And they have really permanently lowered their cost structure, but I think we will see continued improvement in Q4, for the Industrial operating margin and that would give them, sort of an implied 80 to 90 BPS improvement for the full year, which is just outstanding, and again, much stronger than that on a two-year stack basis. Thank you. Morning. Yeah. So on the margin standpoint, the product labels, specifically for Europe is neutral to their gross margin rate. Having said that it is favorable from a working capital standpoint, because many of the private label comes with extended terms. So the team has been able to see the benefit of that. And in turn, they're taking their working capital improvements in reinvesting an additional product offerings and additional M&A such as [Indiscernible] that Paul and Will talked about earlier. We haven't really given that out yet. I mean, it's starting off slow with a number of product lines and we haven't given out a target. It's not going to be something. It's not ever going to be like what you see, certainly in the U.S. but going to a 10% and incremental improvement year-on-year out. I think you can expect that. Yes. We think that fourth quarter is probably in the 3 to 4% range. We would say that that would be 3 to 4% for our Global Automotive and 1 to 2% for industrial. It's slightly higher on the us automotive than it is on international automotive. Then Greg, having said that and again, I couldn't be more pleased with our teams. They are doing a tremendous job and we do not think despite having incremental inflation coming in Q4, we're confident in our ability to manage through that and be able to continue to deliver gross margin improvements. Well, Greg. I guess just generally what we would say when you look at our top-line results and you look at the strong demand, whether it's industrial or automotive. I mean, at this point, we haven't seen the push back, and part of it is the nature of our business that is non-discretionary. So we haven't seen necessarily the push back, pricing has stayed rational and inflations in all sectors, all industries. So really haven't seen that yet. Thank you I guess I would comment and again, these are just great things they're really important to our teammates and they are important for the work force. And yet having said that, they don't come with significant costs. I mean, what we would point to that is just more relevant on the SG&A is just the true labor and wage inflation that we're seeing. Part of it is making sure that you have competitive benefit programs and things like that, we've talked about healthcare and some of those things, paid time off vacation.  But I think more important and more significant is just the true wage inflation that we're seeing. Having said that though, we couldn't be more pleased with the team's hard work in really permanently reducing our cost structure and being able to offset a lot of that inflationary impact with some of our initiatives. So I would not say that you need a model anything in there for the incremental benefit of those types of programs. And all that is contemplated in our full-year operating margin improvement that we've kind of models. So we feel good about it going forward. Yeah. I think look there weren't any major surprises. Our results were really due to the stronger sales and continued recovery in automotive and industrial. The 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin gains with a highly inflationary environment, but having cost controls to really drive improved margins was important. We had terrific cash flow in the quarter, and again, with all the supply chain disruptions.  So having that higher volume and really the industrial recovery has been coming quicker each quarter. So that went into our thinking as we look at the rest of the year, but we feel really good about Q4. But again, it's been a great team effort. And I think as we've seen each quarter, recoveries and the reopening of economies and the fundamentals have gotten better each quarter. Yeah, look, I mean it's a very fluid environment with these price increases. I mean, as they're presented to us and again, the global sourcing and supply chain and procurement teams work very closely with the vendors and they look at timing and we look at areas that we can have time to work into those price increases. We look at accelerating purchases. I mean, there's a lot of work that's being done and the timing of when they go to market is a factor in that as well.  There will be some that carries over. Brenda next year, certainly, but it's a day-to-day, week-to-week negotiation right now. It is more normal inflation and industrial, so keep that in mind, the 1 to 2% is just more normal inflation for them. It's really the us automotive that's got the heightened inflation. Again international automotive a little more normal. We will have some that goes into next year. But again, teams are doing great job to work through that and have improvement. We'd like to thank you for your participation in today's earnings call. We look forward to updating you on our year-end and fourth quarter results in February, and thank you for your support."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report strong financial results again this quarter, which reflects the consistent execution of our strategic priorities as the global markets continue to recover. As we size up the business climate and how we are managing through the recovery, we can report the GPC team is generating positive momentum in both our sales and operating results. And we are well positioned for both near and long-term growth.  Despite inflationary pressures, our margins reflect the success of our category management initiatives in cost control efforts which have offset these increases. And finally, our strategic efforts with our global supplier partners have prevented significant shortfalls and our overall inventory levels allowing us to deliver quality customer service. Taken a look at our third quarter financial results, total sales were 4.8 billion up 10% from last year and up 11% from Q3 of 2019. We also produced our 16th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion.  And we further improved our productivity and customer service capabilities with the ongoing execution of our operational initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 14% and our segment margin improved 30 basis points to 9.3%. This represents our strongest margin in 2 decades and confirms our key initiatives are driving meaningful improvements. Net income was 229 million or a $1.59 for diluted share and adjusted net income was 270 million or a $1.88 per share.  This is a 15% increase from 2020 and establishes a new record for GPC's quarterly earnings, so just an outstanding job by the GPC team. Total sales for global automotive also set a new record at 3.2 billion for the quarter. This represents an 8% increase from Q3 2020, and a 15% increase from Q3 of 2019. On a comp basis, sales were up 5% from last year and up 7% on a two-year stack, with our strongest year-over-year automotive comps coming from the U.S. business.  In addition, from a cadence perspective, sales held up well through the quarter with the strongest average daily sales volume in each of our geographies coming in September. The broad strength in our global automotive sales reflects a number of factors. First, we're proud of our team's efforts to shore up our supply chain amidst the difficult backdrop of product delays and logistics challenges. Supply chain disruptions have been more substantial for U.S. automotive than in our international or industrial operations.  And we continue to work closely with our global suppliers to manage through these issues and ensure we have the right inventory available for our customers. We are confident in the effectiveness of our global sourcing team and believe we are well-positioned in the industry. We also continue to benefit from our key growth initiatives and market tailwinds. Among our growth initiatives, our emphasis on innovative sales programs and sales force effectiveness are positively impacting commercial sales.  As examples, we recently finalized an exclusive partnership in the education space for technician recruitment with over 10,000 active tech students in the process of earning their credentials. We're also excited that NAPA and AAA have executed an agreement for NAPA to be the exclusive auto parts supplier for the new AAA branded premium battery. This battery will be available to all consumers with a focus on the over 62 million AAA cardholders and 5,400 approved auto repair centers.  We're also equipping our sales team with incremental resources, training and development, which have led to more productive, customer-facing calls. In addition, our omni -channel investments continue to drive strong B2B and B2C digital sales. And finally, the international rollout of the NAPA brand is driving significant growth in both our European and Asia-Pac operations.  So now turning to the market tailwinds, these macro drivers include the following: The ongoing reopening of the economy, and improving miles-driven which generate the need for more repairs and more maintenance. A robust used car market, that is keeping more cars on the road longer. And improving the aftermarket fundamentals, such as the growing and aging vehicle fleet, which will continue to benefit the industry over the long term.  Looking next at our automotive highlights by region, total U.S. sales were up 9%. Comp sales increased 8% from last year and are up 5% on a 2 year stack. In Canada, total sales were up 1% with comp sales essentially flat both year-over-year and on a two-year stack as lockdowns in major markets have slowed the recovery. it's been encouraging to see these restrictions of easing of late, which should lead to stronger demand through the final 3 months of 2021.  Our U.S. sales were driven by strong demand for product categories such as exhaust, ride control, brakes, tools, and equipment which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were positive for the third consecutive quarter. By customer segment, sales to both commercial and retail customers held strong, with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the second straight quarter.  We do remain pleased, however, with the continued strength of our DIY business and believe we can drive additional growth with ongoing initiatives, such as B2C digital investments. These include new search features, improving catalog functionality, and enhanced payment options, such as, buy now and pay later. NAPA online, B2C sales continue to grow at a rapid pace, up over 40% from the third quarter, and up 2x from 2019.  The strength in commercial sales in the quarter was driven by several of the initiatives mentioned earlier, as well as the ongoing economic recovery in the U.S.. Sales to our major account partners were strongest with mid-teen growth, followed by sales for our NAPA AutoCare customers, which were up low double digits. We would add that our NAPA AutoCare membership has surged with the reopening of markets and includes nearly 400 shop upgrades thus far in 2021.  So really terrific momentum for our premier independent garage program. Rounding out our commercial segments, fleet, and government and other wholesale customers, also posted high single-digit growth for the quarter. So really strong results across all of our commercial accounts. These are encouraging trends and as we look ahead, we remain confident in our growth strategy and our key priorities to deliver customer value. and ultimately sell more parts for more cars.  Our AAD team in Europe continue to perform well with total Q3 sales up 8%, were up a strong 23% on a two-year stack. Comp sales increased 2.5% from last year and were up 14% on a 2-year stack. While the UK and Benelux continue to stand out with really strong results, we were pleased with the solid results in each of our 7 European markets. A reflection of stable market conditions and execution of our key sales initiatives.  These include the continued roll-out of the NAPA brand and ongoing emphasis on key account development, which are driving market share gains. Now looking at our Asia-Pac business, total sales were up 2% from 2020 and up 18% on a 2-year stack. Comp sales were up slightly from last year and up 15% on a 2-year stack. With both commercial and retail sales up double-digit, driven by positive growth with both the Repco and NAPA brand.  We're really pleased with these results given the severe lock downs and the major markets of Sydney, Melbourne, and Auckland during much of the quarter. We're energized to see the reopening of these markets is finally getting underway, and we expect a surge in demand in the coming month. So now let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this segment were 1.6 billion, a strong 15% increase from last year, and a 5% increase from 2019. Comp sales were up 13% and up 4% on a 2-year stack.  Through the quarter, average daily sales in July and August were in line with the second quarter, while our strongest results were in the month of September. This quarter's positive momentum and industrial exceeded our expectations, which is a reflection of the great work by our motion team, and the strengthening of the industrial economy. Both the PMI and industrial production were positive for the quarter and these indicators correlate closely to the overall healthy state of the industrial sales climate.  For the second consecutive quarter, we had positive sales growth across each of our industries served. The industry's sectors that stood out with double-digit growth include our largest customers segment, equipment and machinery, as well as iron and steel, automotive, aggregate and cement, lumber and wood, fabricated metals, equipment rental, and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry experienced tremendous growth.  So as you can see, the current growth in our industrial business is quite broad across the markets we serve. As we have conveyed in our prior calls and in our industrial Deep Dive event on September 15, our Motion business is a market leader in the industrial distribution space in North America and Australasia. DMI team strive to be the preferred industrial solutions provider in the industries we serve. We partner with the best manufacturers in the industry to provide Tier 1 brand, our customers demand.  In addition, we are constantly broadening our product offering, as well as our service capabilities to maximize our sales potential and drive market share gains in a very large and fragmented market. With these fundamentals of our business in mind, our focus on continued profitable growth in this segment remained grounded in 5 key initiatives. An omni -channel build-out to accelerate e-commerce growth and drive sales with new customers.  As examples, Motion.com and our inside sales center, which has grown from 15 to now, 35 reps in just 6 months continue to drive incremental sales from new motion customers. The expansion of our industrial services and value-add solutions in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance, and automation.  Strategic M&A to generate significant growth in new markets and new products, and services as an industry consolidator. Enhanced strategy to create a dynamic pricing environment that provides us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And lastly, network optimization and automation to further improve our operating efficiencies and productivity. We're pleased with the progress from these initiatives, thus far, and we are excited for the opportunities ahead.  Another third quarter highlight, is the publication of our 2021 sustainability report update. Our initiatives and activities over the past year have lead to continued progress toward our goal of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. We've also taken steps to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by reducing energy and emissions while increasing recycling opportunities across the globe.  2020 tested all of us and accentuated the importance of supporting our people and our communities. We're really proud of our GPC teammates around the world for their resilience and contributions to further in our sustainability goals. We invite you to learn more about these initiatives and our full report which you can find on the GPC website. So in summary, we made great progress in several important areas during the third quarter.  And we're very pleased with the strong result in our automotive and industrial businesses, and the continued improvement in our sales and operations. We could not be more proud of the GPC team. Now, I will turn the call over to Will. Will? Thank you, Carol. As we close out another strong quarter, we are pleased with our progress in driving profitable growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder We attribute the positive momentum in our business to our global team work and disciplined focus across all of our operations. Our team has confidence in the strategic plans we have put in place to capture long-term growth and margin expansion.  Our strategic plans combined with an exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments at organic and acquisitive growth. While also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So as we look ahead, we are encouraged to see the impact of the global pandemic subsiding. while the fundamentals of our two global businesses remained rock solid.  Our GPC teams around the world are stepping up under challenging circumstances and taking great care of our customers. That we thank you for your interest in GPC. and we thank each of our GPC teammates for their passion, their dedication, and their hard work. So with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Well, Chris, first off, thanks for your question. You've hit it when you look across all of our businesses, the quarter the third quarter got stronger as we progressed with September being our strongest month. And what we can tell you is that the trends that we saw in September are carrying over into the month of October.  So we're feeling good about where we are. And we certainly feel really good about the projections that we put out there for Q4. So yeah, right now everything is looking pretty solid. Thanks, Chris. Hi, Bret. I'll take a shot at that Bret, thanks to your question, it's -- look it's hard to say where we're gaining this year. I can tell you with some of the product category that we look at and the growth that we're seeing in Q3. And on top of a really solid Q2, we have to be up outpacing the general market. But we're also the first one out, Bret, so we'll see what the numbers look like here going forward. Bottom line is, as we all know, the automotive aftermarket is incredibly fragmented.  We like where we're at, we like the performance by our NAPA team and they had a terrific quarter and actually had terrific back-to-back quarters. And as I mentioned in the initial question, we're out of the gates in great shape in the month of October, so we expect that to continue. And I would also comment Bret that, we feel the same way about our international automotive businesses in our European team as well as our Asia-Pac team continue to perform at a high level. Yeah, I'll touch on the acceptance part, maybe Carol you weigh in on the margins. The acceptance Bret, I have to tell you is beyond our expectation, so much so that we are accelerating our -- the number of product lines. And we're accelerating the pace with which we're rolling those out. So as you look across our European aftermarket business, we really started in the UK and our UK business continues to outperform. And now we've rolled that out into the other market. And I have to tell you it's really surpassed our expectation. So really pleased and I would also say we are rolling it out in Australia and New Zealand as well with similar results. You're welcome. Yeah. Greg. It's a good question. Thanks for it. It is certainly a dynamic M&A market. I think as we alluded to, we have a very disciplined approach to thinking about deals. Whether it's financially, operationally, strategically, etc. And for us, it's all about the value creation potential.  And I think on our Industrial Conference, I made a comment talking about creating value so that the eight or nine times becomes something lower than that. And so that's how we think about [Indiscernible]. What does this business look like? And how much value can we create when we bring it into the GPC family. Greg, I would also add on to that one. When we look at our bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive space, whether it's in Europe or here across North America. Those continue to be very reasonable and rational, and are very close to our historic kind of valuations. But as Will said, we'll -- we will continue to be incredibly disciplined as we look at M&A here going forward. Thanks. Our industrial business has held up -- well, you see the numbers Andrew that our industrial numbers are as strong as they've ever been. We had a terrific -- the team had a terrific Q3. We're not seeing that type of supply chain disruptions on the industrial side as we're seeing across the automotive -- North America automotive sector.  So they are in good shape, not to mention our industrial team going into 2021 did not trim back their inventories. They were in a good place, an inventory. And that is largely held up throughout the course of the year which has led to that great sales increase, they popped in Q3. So all is good on the industrial front. Thank you. Well, I would tell you, Seth, that I think it's a combination of factors. I think our U.S. automotive team continues to get their legs under them. The year, continues to get better as we go. I mentioned October is looking strong. It's looking strong across all regions of the country. It's looking strong in both DIY and DIFM.  And we don't -- we don't see it slowing. I would also comment that we had our best month, our best quarter with our big partners on the major accounts side, our AutoCare business continued strong and, Seth, our DIY business continues strong. So it's really across the board, it's held up well and we're seeing that trend continue on the month of October as well. It's really both Seth and I. And again, I would give our team high marks on the strategy they put together going into 2021, which was all around sales team effectiveness and putting more sales reps out on the street and getting them focused on the end-user customer. And even when you look at our So kind of what we deem as our all other wholesale business, which is a significant chunk of business that was up high single-digits, year-over-year.  So I think a combination of growing business with existing customers, but also kind of restructuring our approach to the customers with our sales team and really driving a lot of new business as well. So very pleased with the NAPA team and where we find ourselves. Thanks, Seth. I'll take a shot at the first part of that. David, the Buy Now, Pay Later pilot, we're in about 250 NAPA stores. And look, I give our team credit for jumping on the opportunity. It's so early yet. It's -- I would misspeak if I tried to put a number to it. It's something new. We'd never done it before. We're not doing it anywhere else in the world at this point. I would just tell you kind of stay tuned and certainly more to come on that initiative.  And then I'm sorry, the second part of your question online. Certainly, the acquisition that was announced, Automotive Accessories Garage, we're excited about that acquisition and it really goes hand-in-hand, David, with recent strategies where we acquired wind parts in Europe, we acquired spares parts in Australia, a few years back. And it's really just broadening our knowledge base and expertise into all things online.  I would certainly expect that this initiative here in the U.S. will follow in a same track that we've done in the international markets. And I'm very pleased to tell you that, they have exceeded our expectations. It's still early at wind parts in Europe, but I would tell you that, early results are very, very, very favorable. And we expect to see the same as we really just expand our knowledge base in selling products online. Thank you."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. We are pleased to report terrific financial performance driven by the consistent execution of our strategic priorities and the ongoing recovery in the global market. In summary, the quarter was highlighted by continued strong sales trends, which we believe led to market share gains, gross margin gains and improved operational efficiencies that drove margin expansion and record quarterly earnings and the effective deployment of capital for growth and productivity investments, bolt-on acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. Taking a look at our second quarter financial results, total sales were $4.8 billion, up 25% from last year and improved sequentially from plus 9% in the first quarter. For your additional perspective, our second quarter sales were 12% higher than in Q2 2019. Gross margin was also strong representing our 15th consecutive quarterly increase, and we further improved our productivity with the ongoing execution of expense initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 35% and our segment margin improved 65 basis points to 9.2%, which represents our strongest margin in two decades. Adjusted net income was $253 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74, up 32%. Total sales for global automotive were a record $3.2 billion, a 28% increase from 2020 and up 15% from the second quarter of 2019 and marks the first quarter in our 93 year history with auto sales exceeding the $3 billion mark. On a comp basis sales were up 21% and on a two year stack comp sales were up 8.5%. Our comp sales in the second quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year comp sales in each of our automotive operations. Automotive segment profit margin improved 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and an increase of 90 basis points from 2019. This expansion was supported by strong operating results across all of our operations. The automotive recovery reflects our focus on key growth initiatives as well as several market tailwinds and these include the broad economic recovery and strengthening consumer demand, favorable weather trends, inflation and our ability to pass along price increases to our customers. Finally, solid industry fundamentals, which have been further accelerated by a surge in used car market and improving miles driven. While these market tailwinds are encouraging, we also see continued headwinds, which we continue to closely monitor. These would include the spread of the deltacoronavirus variant and its potential impact on the global economy, global supply chain disruptions, ongoing labor shortages in our operations and the impact of inflation on our costs such as wages and freight. Turning next to our regional highlights, our GPC teammates in Europe built down there excellent start to the year, achieving the strongest sales growth amongst our operations with comp sales up 34%. Each country posted substantial sales growth, while our UK team continues to outperform. The positive momentum in Europe reflects improving market conditions and favorable weather trends as well as our focus on key sales initiatives, inventory availability, and excellent customer service. In particular, we have seen exceptional results from our key account partners and the ongoing expansion and rollout of the NAPA brand. In our Asia Pac business sales were in line with the mid to high teen comps we have had in this market now for four consecutive quarters. Commercial sales outperformed retail, although both customer segments posted strong growth. The Repco and NAPA brands performed well and collectively are capturing market share. The NAPA network continues to build, and we have now more than 50 NAPA locations operating across Australia and New Zealand in addition to our 400 plus Repco stores. In North America, comp sales increased 20% in the U.S. and we're up 12% in Canada where lockdowns in key markets such as Quebec and Ontario have been headwinds for several quarters now. Sales in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in both the commercial and retail segment with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the first time, since before the pandemic began to take hold in Q1 of 2020. The strengthening commercial sales environment is significant for us as it accounts for 80% of our total U.S. automotive revenue. The strong recovery in the commercial sector contributed to record average daily sales volume and our U.S. automotive business in June. Our sales drivers by product category include brakes, tools and equipment and under car, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were strong for the second consecutive quarter, so another really positive trend. By customer segment, retail sales remained strong throughout the quarter with low double-digit sales growth on top of a healthy sales increase in the second quarter of last year. While the DIY market is pulling back from the highs of 2020, we are optimistic our ongoing investments will create sustainable retail growth. For commercial sales, each of our customers segments posted double-digit growth, which we attribute to the broad automotive recovery and investments in our sales team, our sales programs and our supply chain amongst other initiatives. This quarter, our strongest growth was with our major account partners and NAPA AutoCare centers. We were also pleased with the growth in sales to our fleet and government accounts. This was the first quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth for this group, since before the pandemic as a lag the overall automotive recovery in the U.S. We view this improvement as a meaningful indicator for further growth in the quarters ahead. As the automotive recovery continues, we expect our commercial sales opportunities to outpace retail consistent with the long-term growth outlook for the aftermarket industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and our initiatives to deliver customer value and sell more parts for more cars across our global automotive operations. We also remain focused on enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening in our supply chain and investing in our omni-channel capabilities while expanding our global store footprint to further strengthen our competitive positioning. So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion, a 20% increase from last year, and up 7% from 2019. Comp sales rose 16% and reflect the fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trend. A strong sales environment combined with the execution of our operational initiatives drove a 9.5% segment margin, which is up 130 basis points from both 2020 and 2019. The ongoing market recovery over the last 12 months is in line with the strengthening industrial economy and the overall increase in activity we have seen across much of our customer base. The Purchasing Managers Index measured 60.6 in June, reflecting healthy levels of industrial expansion and marrying trends we have seen throughout the majority of this year. Likewise, industrial production increased by 5.5% in the second quarter representing the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion. Diving deeper into our Q2 sales, we experienced strong sales trends across each of our industries served and our product categories other than safety supplies, which add extraordinary sales in 2020 due to the pandemic. Several industry sectors stood out as their sales increased by 30% or more over the last year, including equipment and machinery, automotive, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry sector experienced tremendous growth. In the past several years of expanding this segment, we have found our broad offering of products and services fits well with the needs of these customers. To drive this growth, we remain focused on several strategic initiatives, which include the build out of our industrial omnichannel capabilities with solid growth and digital sales via motion.com. Our new inside sales center, which was established in 2019, is generating incremental sales from new Motion customers and we see room for further growth. The expansion of our services and value-add solutions businesses in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. Over the last few years, we have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale and continue to target additional M&A opportunities to further enhance our capabilities in these key areas, enhanced pricing and product category management strategies to maximize profitable growth, the further optimization and automation of our supply chain network to improve operational productivity, while delivering exceptional customer service. We are encouraged by industrial strong financial performance in the second quarter and the positive momentum we see in the overall industrial markets. We believe the Motion team is well positioned to capitalize on this momentum and enhance our market leadership position. So in summary, each of our businesses did an exceptional job of operating through the quarter and we couldn't be more proud and grateful for their strong Q2 performance. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning everyone. First, let me reiterate Paul's comments to acknowledge the strong performance this quarter. I'd like to personally congratulate the entire global GPC team for the hard work and impressive results. The teams continue to build momentum and execute well. We remain focused on our defined strategic initiatives and despite the global uncertainties that continue to impact our operations. We're pleased with the strong sales growth, operating leverage and cash flow performance this quarter. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to create value as we leveraged GPC global capabilities to simplify and integrate our operations. We do so to improve the customer experience, to increase the speed and efficiency of execution and to deliver winning performance. This includes continuous investments to position GPC for near and long-term profitable growth. The key pillars of our investments include talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Around the globe, the teams executed well against our strategic priorities. For example, on talent, we announced last month that Naveen Krishna joined the company as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Naveen will help lead our strategy and execution for all technology and digital initiatives. He comes to GPC with more than 25 years of technology experience with companies such as Macy's, Home Depot, Target and FedEx. We're excited to welcome Naveen as we continue to innovate on the customer experience, accelerate the pace of technology execution and build capabilities that advance our long-term strategy. Other examples of recent talent investments include category management, field sales and services, indirect sourcing, pricing, diversity-equity inclusion, digital data and inventory leadership to name a few. Investment in our people is always a priority as we execute our mission to be an employer of choice. To highlight other examples of our initiative momentum and local execution, Paul and I recently had the opportunity to spend time in person with our European teammates and they showcase great examples of the strategic initiatives and winning team performance. For example, we discuss details of the growth plans for a recent bolt-on investment Winparts an online leader of automotive parts and accessories. We expect this investment to provide new capabilities and accelerate our European digital vision. We visited a best-in-class distribution facility in the Netherlands that increased operating productivity by approximately 20% over the past few years with automation investments and process excellence initiative. We received an update on the consolidation of 10 back office shared service centers in France to one national location in France to drive costs and process efficiencies. And we saw firsthand the power and differentiation of the NAPA brand in the local market. Although these are only a few select examples in Europe, in each of our automotive and industrial businesses we see similar examples of focused strategic execution that are delivering results. We also executed well on our acquisition strategy during the quarter. The M&A environment is active and we remain disciplined to pursue strategic and value creating transactions. For example, in addition to Winparts, we completed several other bolt-on acquisitions to deliver growth, add capabilities and create value. The North American and European automotive teams completed various store acquisitions that increase our position in key strategic geographies and extend existing customer relationships. Our automotive team in Asia-Pac also executed to bolt-on strategic acquisitions, including rare spares, a market leader in the niche segment of automotive restoration parts and accessories and PARts DB, a leading cloud-based product and supplier data platform that will enhance our e-commerce and data capabilities. We enter the third quarter with strong momentum as our automotive and industrial markets recover and we execute our plans. We continue to analyze and respond to areas that challenge our daily operations such as COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. For example, the global and local procurement teams partner closely with all levels of our suppliers to effectively assess product availability and delivery trends. We have processes in place backed with data and analytics to create visibility into direct and indirect inflation trends. We utilize GPC scale and relationships, including dedicated GPC resources in Asia to address our global logistics needs. And we continue to address labor challenges with competitive pay and benefits, flexible work programs, creative incentives to attract talent, a differentiated culture and compelling career opportunities. We believe our team's well-positioned to remain agile as we focus on what we can control and navigate these macro global headwinds. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and look forward to sharing our continued progress next quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Will. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increased from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives. Although we also continue to benefit from channel and geographical mix shifts, positive product mix, strategic category management initiatives including pricing and global sourcing strategies. In the second quarter, there was significant pricing activity with our suppliers resulting in product cost inflation. We were positioned to pass these increases onto our customers and the impact of price inflation was neutral to gross margin. We estimated 1.5% impact of inflation in automotive sales for the quarter and a 1% impact in industrial. Based on the current environment, we expect this to increase further through the second half of the year. Our total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from last year and 28.1% of sales. The increase from last year reflects the impact of several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $150 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. The balance primarily relates to the increase in variable costs on the $1 billion and additional year-over-year sales. And to a lesser extent, we experienced rising cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance, which we are managing. We also invested in projects associated with our transformation and other initiatives to drive growth and enhanced productivity. So overall, we continue to operate in line with our plans for the year, and we remain focused on gaining additional efficiency in the quarters ahead as you heard from Paul and Will. On a segment basis, our total segment profit in the second quarter was $441 million, up a strong 35%. Our segment profit margin was 9.2% compared to 8.6% last year, a 65 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 100 basis points from 2019. So strong operating results and a reflection of the work we have done to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio over the last several years. We would add that for the full year we continue to expect our segment profit margin to improve by 20 basis points to 30 basis points from today 2020 or 60 basis points to 70 basis points from 2019. This would represent our strongest margin in five years. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2% on an adjusted basis, up from 24.1% last year. The increase in rate primarily reflects a higher UK tax rate, partially offset by stock compensation excess tax benefits. Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $196 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.36. Our adjusted net income was $253 million or $1.74 per share, which compares to $191 million or $1.32 per share in the prior year, a 32% increase. Turning to our second quarter results by segment; our automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 28% from last year. Segment profit was $291 million, up 33% with profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and a 90 basis point increase from 2019. We attribute the margin gain to the positive market conditions in our automotive business, and our team's intense focus on the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We're encouraged by the positive momentum we will carry into the balance of the year. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from 2020. Segment profit of $150 million was up 38% from a year ago and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, a 130 basis point increase from both 2020 and 2019. So with this strengthening sales environment and continued operational improvement, this group continues to post excellent operating results, and we expect industrial perform well through the balance of the year. Now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At June 30th our total accounts receivable is up 4%. Despite the strong sales increase, this is primarily due to the additional sale of $300 million in receivables in the second half 2020. Inventory was up 10% consistent with our commitment to provide for inventory availability and our accounts payable increased 26%. Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 112% last year. We remain pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position. Our total debt is $2.5 billion, down $700 million or 22% from June of 2020, and down $160 million from December 31, 2020. We closed the second quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity, and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.6 times from 2.9 times last year. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our capital structure over the last year. We continue to generate strong cash flow with another $400 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $700 million for the six-month. For the full year we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividends and share repurchases. We have invested $90 million in capital expenditures thus far in the year, and we expect these investments to pick-up further in the quarters ahead as we execute on additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations. As Will mentioned earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We've used approximately $97 million in cash for acquisitions through the six months. And we continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to compliment both our global automotive and industrial segments as we move forward. Consistent with our longstanding dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $232 million to our shareholders through the first half of this year. This reflects the 2021 annual dividend of $3.26 per share and represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. Finally, as part of our share repurchase program, we have been active with share buybacks since 1994. In the second quarter, we used $184 million to acquire 1.4 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are updating our full-year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 22nd of 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance we considered several factors including our past performance and recent business trends, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, the potential for foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. We also consider that consider uncertainties due to the market disruptions, such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12% and increase from our previous guidance of plus 5% to plus 7%. As usual this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business we are guiding two plus 11 to plus 13% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 5% to plus 7% and a total sales increase of plus 6% to plus 8% for the industrial segment, an increase for the plus four to plus 6%. On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.20 to $6.35, which is up 18% to 20% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. We enter the third quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results, and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. We are pleased with our progress in capturing profitable growth, generating strong cash flow and driving shareholder value. This quarter's 25% total sales growth reflects the benefits of a strengthening global economy and positive sales environment in both our automotive and industrial businesses. Importantly, this dual recovery allows us to leverage the full scale of one GPC, which we believe creates significant value. Our team also executed well and produced our 15th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, while further improving our productivity via ongoing expense initiatives. Our global team network and disciplined focus in these areas enabled us to report strong operating results and record quarterly earnings. Our exceptional balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, the investments and organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases. The GPC team is focused on executing our growth strategy and operational initiatives to further enhance our financial performance in the remainder of 2021 and beyond. We thank you for your interest in GPC, and also thank each of our GPC teammates for their continued dedication, passion and commitment to be in the best in serving all our company's stakeholders. So with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nPaul Donahue: Good morning, Chris.\nCarol Yancey: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Horvers: So can you \u2013 it looks like, is it fair to say you're just assuming sort of the two year comp stacks hold in both divisions for the balance of the year and in related to the Motion side, Motion is not yet positive on a two year basis. What would \u2013 what's going to be the inhibitor that would not allow that to pause turn positive on a two year basis?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, I think, Chris you're spot on. I think Motion is not positive on a two year stack yet. We are really encouraged by the fundamentals as Paul mentioned and the lag that we see in that business. We're encouraged by the activities going on. We are implying a similar trend for them in the second half, so on a \u2013 second half, mid-single digit, on a comp basis for them, but that still is just flattish to slightly up on a two year stack basis. And I think on the automotive side, I mean, I think again you're spot on sort of the second half mid-single digit on the automotive comps that we would be a bit higher than that in the U.S. So again, on a two year stack basis more normal mid-single digit on a two year stack basis, so similar to where we are now, but a bit better certainly in U.S. automotive.\nPaul Donahue: Chris, I would add specifically to Motion. We and I think you've alluded to it in the past this recovery that we're seeing in both automotive and industrial. When you look at U.S. manufacturing, our customers are operating at higher run rates. They're accelerating CapEx, plants are returning to full production. If you look at the PMI numbers, you look at industrial production, all is very, very positive. So when you couple that with what we're seeing on capital projects really gaining steam, we're very, very bullish about our industrial business moving forward.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then as a follow-up, you talked about record average daily volumes. I think you were referring to U.S. NAPA in the month of June and you referred to momentum in the business. Maybe can you expand on that a little bit? And within that I think there is a lot of concerns out there on the DIY, DIY is not immaterial. It is 20% of the business. So could you perhaps talk about what you're seeing on the DIY side of the business in the U.S. as well?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. First, let me just comment on the specific numbers, Chris. So, we wrapped up Q1 with a record sales month for us in March. That momentum carried into Q2. We had a really solid quarter with May, June being our strongest, June being the strongest month and a record month again. And then as we moved into July again pleased to say that that's holding up. So we're really, really encouraged by what we're seeing in U.S. automotive. And specifically to DIY, we're not seeing a pullback in our strong DIY business. We're up low double-digits in Q2 and our two year stack I think raises well over 20%. So our teams have \u2013 as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, we've worked incredibly hard to get our retail footprint in what we believe to be much better in a much better selling mode than we've ever been. So could it pull back a little bit with the lack of stimulus money in the economy, it could be. I think we'll see that perhaps in some of the more retail focused competitors, but now we feel good, we feel good about our DIFM business and our DIY business going forward.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Jordan, your line is live. Sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on your commentary with regards to inflation that you had mentioned that you've seen about 150 bps of inflation in automotive and 100 in the industrials. How much of that is from just higher product costs versus transportation and labor? And how would you categorize this period of inflation versus 2019 with tariffs and the ability to manage it?\nCarol Yancey: Yes look, if we look at our inflation, I would tell you first of all it is a bit unique and unprecedented as it relates to U.S. automotive for inflation. We haven't seen this kind of activity for a decade, if you will. And it is \u2013 as you mentioned, it's sort of similar to tariffs and that the pace that they're coming. Look, it is driven by what you said a combination of raw materials and freight and labor. And our teams work very closely from a category management perspective to work with the suppliers to look at commodity tracking and the cost model and the supplier line reviews. And while we don't break out specifically, how much is each component, trust me, the teams work with the suppliers on that. On the industrial side, it's more normal. So I would tell you their inflation is definitely more normal. And so what we do think is that second half will be more active than Q2. So we could see as much as two times the second quarter inflation rate in our second half, but again, couldn't be happier with the teams and all of our businesses and the work they're doing to pass those through to our customers and be able to get greater gross profit dollars, but maintain our gross margin rate. So we're working hard on that, and we are definitely optimistic as we look ahead that we'll be able to do that again in the second half.\nKate McShane: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just around the global supply chain. Could you remind us if you have any meaningful exposure to Vietnam since that seems to be an area of the world that's having trouble dealing with the Delta variant right now?\nPaul Donahue: Kate, we have no material exposure to Vietnam.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nCarol Yancey: And Kate, I would just add one other thing. We have our geographic diversification, if you will, is really great protection for us. So whether we have domestic suppliers we have European suppliers, we have Asian suppliers, we have the ability to have protection with a broad diversification amongst our geographies and supplier base.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll go back to the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Hi, is it working this time?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, it is.\nPaul Donahue: Yes, we hear you, Bret.\nBret Jordan: I have a lot of phone problems on this call today. But I guess a question, did you give us the U.S. NAPA comp against the 2019 second quarter, I might have missed that.\nCarol Yancey: Yes, the U.S. comp two year stack is mid-single digits.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then, I guess, question on the wage inflation that you're seeing, and I guess, a) the transitory, and b) what kind of cost increases are you seeing at the store level?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, Bret, I think, what we would talk about on the wage inflation again similar to on the inflation on the product side this is a big factor in what we're seeing. I mean, all companies are seeing rising costs and inflation, certainly in wages and freight and as we mentioned some other categories. We do think when we looked at our SG&A this quarter that our inflation in our SG&A was certainly greater than the product inflation, so more like a 2% in our cost. And that ended up being about 50 to 60 basis points on our SG&A. And we certainly didn't have that in Q1, so we did have that in Q2. But look we're working hard with investments and projects and again weather, Will mentioned it, whether it's transformation or strategic investments in productivity, but we do think this inflation in wages stays with us. We don't believe it's necessarily transitory for this year. We're going to continue to work hard on it, but we think it stays with us for a bit.\nBret Jordan: Okay.\nPaul Donahue: Hi, Bret, I would also add that it's a very surgical approach by geography, by job type. So we've done a lot of really good thinking and analytics to make sure that we're hitting the areas of the business that are most impacted, but just want to share that perspective.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then a question on regional performance, I think you called out weather as one of the positives. Could you talk about sort of in the U.S. auto market, about the highlights and the low lights and maybe the spread in the comp between the peak and the valley?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, this quarter, Bret, was unprecedented with the strong double-digit growth we saw across all six of our divisions leading the pack for us as our guys up in the Northeast. But they were impacted the most last year. So it does stand to reason a bit, but really strong performance in the east, going down to the Atlantic. Also pleased though out West in the mountain division, these guys continue to deliver. So top to bottom, the division out of the sixth the \u2013 of the sixth, we had a spread anywhere from 25% to 26% on the top end and 20% on the bottom, so all really, really strong performance across the U.S.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: You're welcome, Bret.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I have really two questions. Let's start on inflation just to make sure I'm getting this right. The 150 is in the product COGS, but then there is also SG&A inflation. I guess, asked another way, what sort of a top-line benefit or do you expect to see indeed the pass through? Is it 3% or 4% to offset all the areas of costs inflation that you're getting either yourself or with the jobbers?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Look because of our transformation work that we did and some of the cost saving work that we've done, we think it's less than 3% that we would have to have if you will to pass through. But it's \u2013 definitely this is more specific to U.S. automotive. So we want to make sure that again as we've talked about this product inflation and honestly even to a same extent, the inflation and wages and whatnot, it is a little more prevalent in U.S. automotive. So it's, again, we are able to leverage our costs with less than 3% comp. So that's something that we achieved with our cost savings. So we're just going to keep again, we've got a lot of initiatives in place. I want to just remind you though we still have full year operating margin improvement, in our full year we've got the 20 to 30 basis points operating margin improvement. So we still feel good about being able to deliver that this year.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then may be linked to that on the margin side, you mentioned vendor bonuses helping. Is that more relevant to automotive or industrial?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, actually that's on the gross margin side. And so our gross margin improvement in the quarter, the 120 bps, about a third of that was volume incentives. That's both on automotive and industrial, and it's directly related to the additional billion dollars of revenue that we had and tied to the product purchases. So about a third of the gross margin was improved volume incentives, a third of it was from mix, we've talked about geographical mix, product mix, customer mix, and then a third is just from our strategic category management initiatives and pricing initiatives. So again, feeling good about gross margin as we look ahead.\nGreg Melich: And I'm going to sneak one end, if I could. You said July call was as strong as June, is that\u2026\nPaul Donahue: July \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry, Greg.\nGreg Melich: Is that equal in both commercial and for DIY? Or is one sort of taking the lead on that?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, our DIFM business, Greg, as you heard, is very, very strong and that goes across our major account business, which has really, really bounced back strong. Our AutoCare \u2013 NAPA AutoCare business has really strong. What we're really pleased with Greg is our government in fleet business, which has lagged behind our AutoCare and major account recovery. That business has bounced back with high single-digit growth. So DIFM really continues to carry the load, which by the way we fully expected as the economy bounced back as miles driven really began to ramp back up. Our \u2013 there's so much pent-up demand out there. Our garages are as busy as we have seen them in quite some time. So DIFM continues to carry the weight. And we think as, as we have seen in recent years, DIFM is going to continue to be really strong.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Well, good luck everyone. Have a great one.\nWillStengel: Okay. Thanks, Greg.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. I guess my first question is around something like global supply chain challenges that you and most are facing. Do you feel like you're missing sales because you're out of stock of certain products or product categories?\nWillStengel: Look, here's what I would say that the \u2013 we're all dealing with supply chain issues. All of our peers are as well-documented as you said. Our primary challenge is not in the industrial business, it's not in our international business. It's primarily a U.S. automotive business issue, which is just as a reminder about a third of our overall. I've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our global sourcing team and we're very confident they're doing everything they can. I would tell you, Seth, that at this time being a global player having the size and scale that we have, we do believe that that we're getting as good of supply as anybody in the automotive aftermarket and our team is working incredibly hard to ensure that that remains the case. We're missing sales here and there, you would have to \u2013 you would certainly have to believe we are, but we also believe that that will come back and our suppliers, we think it's transitory. We know it's transitory. They'll get it together. And we fully expect that to come back probably later in the second half could even \u2013 could even carry a bit into 2022.\nSeth Basham: That's helpful color. And I am thinking about your guidance and the implied operating margins for the balance of the year. It seems like you're expecting incremental margins to not be quite as strong going forward with very strong improvement in your sales outlook and limited improvement in your margin outlook. Is there a reason for that that you could help us understand?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Look, I think our implied margin outlook for the rest of the year, the full year, and compared to what we had last quarter, it would be similar. I mean, we are and again, we have considered some of the factors as we've talked about inflation on our costs, but we'd considered the stronger growth, we've considered the stronger top line. And I think when you look at our margin improvement, I mean, it's the two-year basis when you go back to 2019, having that stronger margin improvement year-over-year is something that we expect to deliver. So I think again we have a little bit of cautiousness as we look ahead, but it's still improved margin for 2020 and on a two-year basis it's 70 basis points to 80 basis points for 2019.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thank you very much.\nWillStengel: Thanks, Seth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you. Just I guess, since we've now lapsed a periods last year that were most severely impacted, which specific customer groups or regions do you think are still running below normalized levels or are still being negatively impacted by the pandemic?\nWillStengel: Well, Liz, great question. I would tell you that I mentioned earlier our great bounce back in our major account business, out AutoCare business, [indiscernible] government that, that segment while up high-single digits in the quarter is still trending a bit behind some of the other categories. So that, I guess that would be the one that I would call out. But it's hard \u2013 it's hard to call out our team when they're delivering a high-single digit increase in that product or in that customer category.\nLiz Suzuki: Yes. I mean, fair enough. Is it the same \u2013 in the case of the industrial group, what do you think are the customer groups that are still pretty far below normalized levels. They're still have the most potential room for recovery?\nWillStengel: Yes. So on the industrial side if you look at the one area where we were lagging a bit year-over-year was in the safety type products. But if I look across the industries just about everyone is putting up tremendous numbers. I've mentioned equipment and machinery as really being strong. A new category that we're looking at fulfillment and logistics, which is all distribution center, related is really strong. We've had some challenges on the OE automotive primarily due to shortage in the chips. But that's going to \u2013 that's going to come back. So again, all in all our motion team is performing at an incredibly high level and had a great quarter.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nWillStengel: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Thanks, I appreciate you give in. I wanted to go back to the SG&A outlook you touched on Carol. I get things are inflationary and you noted that's accelerating, but I think you also mentioned some of the leverage was from investments in specific projects for future transformation. Can you provide any more color on what that is? And then a related question, obviously you removed a lot of costs last year with the business. How has the pace of bringing those costs back been this year relative to your expectations? Have you been able to keep some of those structural costs out?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. So when we look at our SG&A and I'll go about it a couple of different ways for the quarter. So this quarter the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million costs \u2013 temporary cost savings last year in Q2, significant portion was government subsidies, payroll deduction, delayed merit increases, furloughs. So we knew this would be our toughest quarter on those. So that's honestly about half of the increase in the dollar increase in SG&A. The increase in variable costs, as I mentioned, I mean, we have incremental $1 billion more in sales. So about a third of the increase was related to bringing back the variable costs to handle the volume. And then the investments in projects, a relatively small amount but an important amount. So that is investments, Will mentioned some of the productivity improvements we're doing. We've got in our industrial business automation in their warehouses, in our automotive business, consolidating facilities and putting in further automation, investments in pricing, and digital initiatives. So that was roughly say 5% of the dollar increase. And then the, the remaining amount roughly 10% of the dollar increase was the rising cost and inflation. What I would tell you is we have kept the permanent cost savings that we had last year, which ended up being $150 million on a target of $100 million. And in bringing back these costs, I mean, we had just a surge in growth. And so you do have to bring in those variable costs. What we didn't really expect was the rising costs and inflation, but thank goodness we did the work we did on the transformation team. And again, we continue to see some investments and projects as we look ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That's helpful color. And there's a follow-up on the M&A. Obviously things seem like they're picking up as we hopefully further away from this pandemic. Can you talk about what cellar multiples are and maybe by geography, it looks like you bought a little bit kind of across the automotive landscape, but given maybe some of these customers had elevated results last year, maybe some were weaker. Are sellers coming to the table with reasonable multiples or how hard is it to find a deal that you actually like right now?\nWillStengel: Yes. It's a great question, Daniel. I would say you're right. The M&A environment is very active. I would say that the market is working through the expectations of sellers. You're right in thinking that those expectations are pretty high. I think for us the key takeaway for everybody to hear is the discipline that we have around doing the right deal. So we look at a lot of deals to do a few and do the right ones where we can create a ton of values. So you're right though, we're actively working the pipeline. We will continue to work the pipeline, but we're going to stay very disciplined on doing the right deals for ourselves.\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Daniel, I would also mentioned, we're very selective in our M&A targets and I think a couple that were called out were Winparts, which is a online \u2013 a leading online player in Europe and that \u2013 that's \u2013 it's very targeted. We want to further our online presence across our European markets and we found a great partner in Winparts and so more to come on that later. Will and I were actually in the Netherlands last week. Our first international trip in 18 months, spend a half day with this group and very impressive and we think nice upside in the future.\nDaniel Imbro: And here's the quick related follow-up. Can you disclose what kind of multiples you typically try to pay for these kinds of assets in the automotive segment?\nWillStengel: Daniel, we're not going to disclose that at this time.\nDaniel Imbro: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\nWillStengel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question today comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Bellinger: Hey everybody. Thanks for taking the question here. So I believe you mentioned a stronger ticket in U.S. automotive that's actually due to inflation, but is there anything else behind that on the consumer side that really stands out? Just to give a larger ticket repairs, shift older used vehicles, anything else there and just how sustainable can that trend be?\nWillStengel: Yes. David, we've seen a nice bounce up in our average ticket size and we've been watching that for a number of years. Our ticket count was a little bit of a concern where we saw bit of a decline in recent years. What we're really excited about these past couple of quarters is we're watching both ticket count and average ticket size go up. And in this past quarter both were up high-single digits. So we think that's a long-term trend as parts continued to get more and more expensive. And as repair orders continue \u2013 the average repair order continues to move up. So again, we're pleased \u2013 especially pleased to see our traffic up, but also ticket up and both going in the right direction.\nDavid Bellinger: All right, appreciate that. Then my follow-up here; can you expand upon some of the earlier comments around labor constraints that we're talking about? Are you raising wages in the U.S. NAPA stores and DCs now? Is there more overtime given worker shortages, maybe just walk us through what you're seeing and any quantification of higher costs if you can?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. David, the answer is yes to all those things. I mean, again you've got an extremely tough labor market in the U.S. There are labor shortages everywhere, and whether it's stores, it's warehouses, it's delivery drivers, our teams are working tirelessly and there is additional overtime, there's temp help, there's contract labor, and you don't have 20% increases in volume. As Paul mentioned 20%, 25% increases in volume across these geographies with a labor shortage. And so we're doing all we can to take some burdens off our team and to make sure that we can properly service our customers. But it is we are raised raising wages in certain areas and certain categories. And I think as we mentioned, I mean, it was roughly 50 basis points to 60 basis points when you look at overall inflation on our SG&A. Wages being the biggest part and freight being the secondary component.\nWillStengel: Hey, David, I would also just tag onto that to say that, and to clarify that the issue is primarily in our U.S. automotive business and it's in the retail stores, it's roles like delivery drivers that are coming a bit under pressure. We're not seeing this type of pressure in our industrial business, nor are we seeing it much on the international side. So again the one-third of our business, U.S. automotive is where we're feeling the impact and primarily in our retail stores, delivery drivers, those type \u2013 those type roles.\nDavid Bellinger: Yes. Yes. Very helpful. Thanks again, and best of luck as you go through the rest half year.\nWillStengel: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for any final comments.\nCarol Yancey: We'd like to thank you for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call for Q3. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning everyone. First, let me reiterate Paul's comments to acknowledge the strong performance this quarter. I'd like to personally congratulate the entire global GPC team for the hard work and impressive results. The teams continue to build momentum and execute well. We remain focused on our defined strategic initiatives and despite the global uncertainties that continue to impact our operations. We're pleased with the strong sales growth, operating leverage and cash flow performance this quarter. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to create value as we leveraged GPC global capabilities to simplify and integrate our operations. We do so to improve the customer experience, to increase the speed and efficiency of execution and to deliver winning performance. This includes continuous investments to position GPC for near and long-term profitable growth. The key pillars of our investments include talent, sales effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Around the globe, the teams executed well against our strategic priorities. For example, on talent, we announced last month that Naveen Krishna joined the company as Chief Information and Digital Officer. Naveen will help lead our strategy and execution for all technology and digital initiatives. He comes to GPC with more than 25 years of technology experience with companies such as Macy's, Home Depot, Target and FedEx. We're excited to welcome Naveen as we continue to innovate on the customer experience, accelerate the pace of technology execution and build capabilities that advance our long-term strategy. Other examples of recent talent investments include category management, field sales and services, indirect sourcing, pricing, diversity-equity inclusion, digital data and inventory leadership to name a few. Investment in our people is always a priority as we execute our mission to be an employer of choice. To highlight other examples of our initiative momentum and local execution, Paul and I recently had the opportunity to spend time in person with our European teammates and they showcase great examples of the strategic initiatives and winning team performance. For example, we discuss details of the growth plans for a recent bolt-on investment Winparts an online leader of automotive parts and accessories. We expect this investment to provide new capabilities and accelerate our European digital vision. We visited a best-in-class distribution facility in the Netherlands that increased operating productivity by approximately 20% over the past few years with automation investments and process excellence initiative. We received an update on the consolidation of 10 back office shared service centers in France to one national location in France to drive costs and process efficiencies. And we saw firsthand the power and differentiation of the NAPA brand in the local market. Although these are only a few select examples in Europe, in each of our automotive and industrial businesses we see similar examples of focused strategic execution that are delivering results. We also executed well on our acquisition strategy during the quarter. The M&A environment is active and we remain disciplined to pursue strategic and value creating transactions. For example, in addition to Winparts, we completed several other bolt-on acquisitions to deliver growth, add capabilities and create value. The North American and European automotive teams completed various store acquisitions that increase our position in key strategic geographies and extend existing customer relationships. Our automotive team in Asia-Pac also executed to bolt-on strategic acquisitions, including rare spares, a market leader in the niche segment of automotive restoration parts and accessories and PARts DB, a leading cloud-based product and supplier data platform that will enhance our e-commerce and data capabilities. We enter the third quarter with strong momentum as our automotive and industrial markets recover and we execute our plans. We continue to analyze and respond to areas that challenge our daily operations such as COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. For example, the global and local procurement teams partner closely with all levels of our suppliers to effectively assess product availability and delivery trends. We have processes in place backed with data and analytics to create visibility into direct and indirect inflation trends. We utilize GPC scale and relationships, including dedicated GPC resources in Asia to address our global logistics needs. And we continue to address labor challenges with competitive pay and benefits, flexible work programs, creative incentives to attract talent, a differentiated culture and compelling career opportunities. We believe our team's well-positioned to remain agile as we focus on what we can control and navigate these macro global headwinds. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and look forward to sharing our continued progress next quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Carol to review the financial details. Okay. Thanks, Greg. Look, here's what I would say that the \u2013 we're all dealing with supply chain issues. All of our peers are as well-documented as you said. Our primary challenge is not in the industrial business, it's not in our international business. It's primarily a U.S. automotive business issue, which is just as a reminder about a third of our overall. I've got a tremendous amount of confidence in our global sourcing team and we're very confident they're doing everything they can. I would tell you, Seth, that at this time being a global player having the size and scale that we have, we do believe that that we're getting as good of supply as anybody in the automotive aftermarket and our team is working incredibly hard to ensure that that remains the case. We're missing sales here and there, you would have to \u2013 you would certainly have to believe we are, but we also believe that that will come back and our suppliers, we think it's transitory. We know it's transitory. They'll get it together. And we fully expect that to come back probably later in the second half could even \u2013 could even carry a bit into 2022. Thanks, Seth. Well, Liz, great question. I would tell you that I mentioned earlier our great bounce back in our major account business, out AutoCare business, [indiscernible] government that, that segment while up high-single digits in the quarter is still trending a bit behind some of the other categories. So that, I guess that would be the one that I would call out. But it's hard \u2013 it's hard to call out our team when they're delivering a high-single digit increase in that product or in that customer category. Yes. So on the industrial side if you look at the one area where we were lagging a bit year-over-year was in the safety type products. But if I look across the industries just about everyone is putting up tremendous numbers. I've mentioned equipment and machinery as really being strong. A new category that we're looking at fulfillment and logistics, which is all distribution center, related is really strong. We've had some challenges on the OE automotive primarily due to shortage in the chips. But that's going to \u2013 that's going to come back. So again, all in all our motion team is performing at an incredibly high level and had a great quarter. You're welcome. Yes. It's a great question, Daniel. I would say you're right. The M&A environment is very active. I would say that the market is working through the expectations of sellers. You're right in thinking that those expectations are pretty high. I think for us the key takeaway for everybody to hear is the discipline that we have around doing the right deal. So we look at a lot of deals to do a few and do the right ones where we can create a ton of values. So you're right though, we're actively working the pipeline. We will continue to work the pipeline, but we're going to stay very disciplined on doing the right deals for ourselves. Daniel, we're not going to disclose that at this time. Thank you. Yes. David, we've seen a nice bounce up in our average ticket size and we've been watching that for a number of years. Our ticket count was a little bit of a concern where we saw bit of a decline in recent years. What we're really excited about these past couple of quarters is we're watching both ticket count and average ticket size go up. And in this past quarter both were up high-single digits. So we think that's a long-term trend as parts continued to get more and more expensive. And as repair orders continue \u2013 the average repair order continues to move up. So again, we're pleased \u2013 especially pleased to see our traffic up, but also ticket up and both going in the right direction. Hey, David, I would also just tag onto that to say that, and to clarify that the issue is primarily in our U.S. automotive business and it's in the retail stores, it's roles like delivery drivers that are coming a bit under pressure. We're not seeing this type of pressure in our industrial business, nor are we seeing it much on the international side. So again the one-third of our business, U.S. automotive is where we're feeling the impact and primarily in our retail stores, delivery drivers, those type \u2013 those type roles. Thank you. Appreciate it."

            "content": "Thank you, Will. Total GPC sales were $4.8 billion in the second quarter, up 25%. Our gross margin improved to 35.3%, an increased from 33.8% last year or up 120 basis points from an adjusted gross margin of 34.1%. Our improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the increase in supplier incentives. Although we also continue to benefit from channel and geographical mix shifts, positive product mix, strategic category management initiatives including pricing and global sourcing strategies. In the second quarter, there was significant pricing activity with our suppliers resulting in product cost inflation. We were positioned to pass these increases onto our customers and the impact of price inflation was neutral to gross margin. We estimated 1.5% impact of inflation in automotive sales for the quarter and a 1% impact in industrial. Based on the current environment, we expect this to increase further through the second half of the year. Our total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from last year and 28.1% of sales. The increase from last year reflects the impact of several factors, including the prior year benefit of approximately $150 million in temporary savings related to the pandemic. The balance primarily relates to the increase in variable costs on the $1 billion and additional year-over-year sales. And to a lesser extent, we experienced rising cost pressures in areas such as wages, incentive compensation, freight, rents and health insurance, which we are managing. We also invested in projects associated with our transformation and other initiatives to drive growth and enhanced productivity. So overall, we continue to operate in line with our plans for the year, and we remain focused on gaining additional efficiency in the quarters ahead as you heard from Paul and Will. On a segment basis, our total segment profit in the second quarter was $441 million, up a strong 35%. Our segment profit margin was 9.2% compared to 8.6% last year, a 65 basis point year-over-year improvement and up 100 basis points from 2019. So strong operating results and a reflection of the work we have done to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio over the last several years. We would add that for the full year we continue to expect our segment profit margin to improve by 20 basis points to 30 basis points from today 2020 or 60 basis points to 70 basis points from 2019. This would represent our strongest margin in five years. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 27.2% on an adjusted basis, up from 24.1% last year. The increase in rate primarily reflects a higher UK tax rate, partially offset by stock compensation excess tax benefits. Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $196 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.36. Our adjusted net income was $253 million or $1.74 per share, which compares to $191 million or $1.32 per share in the prior year, a 32% increase. Turning to our second quarter results by segment; our automotive revenue was $3.2 billion, up 28% from last year. Segment profit was $291 million, up 33% with profit margin improved to 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and a 90 basis point increase from 2019. We attribute the margin gain to the positive market conditions in our automotive business, and our team's intense focus on the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We're encouraged by the positive momentum we will carry into the balance of the year. Our industrial sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 20% from 2020. Segment profit of $150 million was up 38% from a year ago and profit margin improved to a strong 9.5%, a 130 basis point increase from both 2020 and 2019. So with this strengthening sales environment and continued operational improvement, this group continues to post excellent operating results, and we expect industrial perform well through the balance of the year. Now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At June 30th our total accounts receivable is up 4%. Despite the strong sales increase, this is primarily due to the additional sale of $300 million in receivables in the second half 2020. Inventory was up 10% consistent with our commitment to provide for inventory availability and our accounts payable increased 26%. Our AP to inventory ratio improved to 129% from 112% last year. We remain pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position. Our total debt is $2.5 billion, down $700 million or 22% from June of 2020, and down $160 million from December 31, 2020. We closed the second quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity, and our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.6 times from 2.9 times last year. Our team has done an excellent job of improving our capital structure over the last year. We continue to generate strong cash flow with another $400 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $700 million for the six-month. For the full year we expect our earnings growth and working capital to drive 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion in cash from operations and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividends and share repurchases. We have invested $90 million in capital expenditures thus far in the year, and we expect these investments to pick-up further in the quarters ahead as we execute on additional investments to drive organic growth and improve efficiencies and productivity in our operations. As Will mentioned earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We've used approximately $97 million in cash for acquisitions through the six months. And we continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic and bolt-on acquisitions to compliment both our global automotive and industrial segments as we move forward. Consistent with our longstanding dividend policy, we have also paid a total cash dividend of more than $232 million to our shareholders through the first half of this year. This reflects the 2021 annual dividend of $3.26 per share and represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. Finally, as part of our share repurchase program, we have been active with share buybacks since 1994. In the second quarter, we used $184 million to acquire 1.4 million shares. The company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares, and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are updating our full-year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 22nd of 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance we considered several factors including our past performance and recent business trends, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, the potential for foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. We also consider that consider uncertainties due to the market disruptions, such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results. With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12% and increase from our previous guidance of plus 5% to plus 7%. As usual this excludes the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business we are guiding two plus 11 to plus 13% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 5% to plus 7% and a total sales increase of plus 6% to plus 8% for the industrial segment, an increase for the plus four to plus 6%. On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $6.20 to $6.35, which is up 18% to 20% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. We enter the third quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results, and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Good morning, Chris. Yes, I think, Chris you're spot on. I think Motion is not positive on a two year stack yet. We are really encouraged by the fundamentals as Paul mentioned and the lag that we see in that business. We're encouraged by the activities going on. We are implying a similar trend for them in the second half, so on a \u2013 second half, mid-single digit, on a comp basis for them, but that still is just flattish to slightly up on a two year stack basis. And I think on the automotive side, I mean, I think again you're spot on sort of the second half mid-single digit on the automotive comps that we would be a bit higher than that in the U.S. So again, on a two year stack basis more normal mid-single digit on a two year stack basis, so similar to where we are now, but a bit better certainly in U.S. automotive. Yes look, if we look at our inflation, I would tell you first of all it is a bit unique and unprecedented as it relates to U.S. automotive for inflation. We haven't seen this kind of activity for a decade, if you will. And it is \u2013 as you mentioned, it's sort of similar to tariffs and that the pace that they're coming. Look, it is driven by what you said a combination of raw materials and freight and labor. And our teams work very closely from a category management perspective to work with the suppliers to look at commodity tracking and the cost model and the supplier line reviews. And while we don't break out specifically, how much is each component, trust me, the teams work with the suppliers on that. On the industrial side, it's more normal. So I would tell you their inflation is definitely more normal. And so what we do think is that second half will be more active than Q2. So we could see as much as two times the second quarter inflation rate in our second half, but again, couldn't be happier with the teams and all of our businesses and the work they're doing to pass those through to our customers and be able to get greater gross profit dollars, but maintain our gross margin rate. So we're working hard on that, and we are definitely optimistic as we look ahead that we'll be able to do that again in the second half. And Kate, I would just add one other thing. We have our geographic diversification, if you will, is really great protection for us. So whether we have domestic suppliers we have European suppliers, we have Asian suppliers, we have the ability to have protection with a broad diversification amongst our geographies and supplier base. Thank you. Yes, it is. Yes, the U.S. comp two year stack is mid-single digits. Yes, Bret, I think, what we would talk about on the wage inflation again similar to on the inflation on the product side this is a big factor in what we're seeing. I mean, all companies are seeing rising costs and inflation, certainly in wages and freight and as we mentioned some other categories. We do think when we looked at our SG&A this quarter that our inflation in our SG&A was certainly greater than the product inflation, so more like a 2% in our cost. And that ended up being about 50 to 60 basis points on our SG&A. And we certainly didn't have that in Q1, so we did have that in Q2. But look we're working hard with investments and projects and again weather, Will mentioned it, whether it's transformation or strategic investments in productivity, but we do think this inflation in wages stays with us. We don't believe it's necessarily transitory for this year. We're going to continue to work hard on it, but we think it stays with us for a bit. Yes. Look because of our transformation work that we did and some of the cost saving work that we've done, we think it's less than 3% that we would have to have if you will to pass through. But it's \u2013 definitely this is more specific to U.S. automotive. So we want to make sure that again as we've talked about this product inflation and honestly even to a same extent, the inflation and wages and whatnot, it is a little more prevalent in U.S. automotive. So it's, again, we are able to leverage our costs with less than 3% comp. So that's something that we achieved with our cost savings. So we're just going to keep again, we've got a lot of initiatives in place. I want to just remind you though we still have full year operating margin improvement, in our full year we've got the 20 to 30 basis points operating margin improvement. So we still feel good about being able to deliver that this year. Yes, actually that's on the gross margin side. And so our gross margin improvement in the quarter, the 120 bps, about a third of that was volume incentives. That's both on automotive and industrial, and it's directly related to the additional billion dollars of revenue that we had and tied to the product purchases. So about a third of the gross margin was improved volume incentives, a third of it was from mix, we've talked about geographical mix, product mix, customer mix, and then a third is just from our strategic category management initiatives and pricing initiatives. So again, feeling good about gross margin as we look ahead. Thank you. Yes. Look, I think our implied margin outlook for the rest of the year, the full year, and compared to what we had last quarter, it would be similar. I mean, we are and again, we have considered some of the factors as we've talked about inflation on our costs, but we'd considered the stronger growth, we've considered the stronger top line. And I think when you look at our margin improvement, I mean, it's the two-year basis when you go back to 2019, having that stronger margin improvement year-over-year is something that we expect to deliver. So I think again we have a little bit of cautiousness as we look ahead, but it's still improved margin for 2020 and on a two-year basis it's 70 basis points to 80 basis points for 2019. Yes. So when we look at our SG&A and I'll go about it a couple of different ways for the quarter. So this quarter the comparison to last year was our highest level of temporary cost savings. We had over $150 million costs \u2013 temporary cost savings last year in Q2, significant portion was government subsidies, payroll deduction, delayed merit increases, furloughs. So we knew this would be our toughest quarter on those. So that's honestly about half of the increase in the dollar increase in SG&A. The increase in variable costs, as I mentioned, I mean, we have incremental $1 billion more in sales. So about a third of the increase was related to bringing back the variable costs to handle the volume. And then the investments in projects, a relatively small amount but an important amount. So that is investments, Will mentioned some of the productivity improvements we're doing. We've got in our industrial business automation in their warehouses, in our automotive business, consolidating facilities and putting in further automation, investments in pricing, and digital initiatives. So that was roughly say 5% of the dollar increase. And then the, the remaining amount roughly 10% of the dollar increase was the rising cost and inflation. What I would tell you is we have kept the permanent cost savings that we had last year, which ended up being $150 million on a target of $100 million. And in bringing back these costs, I mean, we had just a surge in growth. And so you do have to bring in those variable costs. What we didn't really expect was the rising costs and inflation, but thank goodness we did the work we did on the transformation team. And again, we continue to see some investments and projects as we look ahead. Yes. David, the answer is yes to all those things. I mean, again you've got an extremely tough labor market in the U.S. There are labor shortages everywhere, and whether it's stores, it's warehouses, it's delivery drivers, our teams are working tirelessly and there is additional overtime, there's temp help, there's contract labor, and you don't have 20% increases in volume. As Paul mentioned 20%, 25% increases in volume across these geographies with a labor shortage. And so we're doing all we can to take some burdens off our team and to make sure that we can properly service our customers. But it is we are raised raising wages in certain areas and certain categories. And I think as we mentioned, I mean, it was roughly 50 basis points to 60 basis points when you look at overall inflation on our SG&A. Wages being the biggest part and freight being the secondary component. Thank you. We'd like to thank you for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in support of Genuine Parts Company, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next call for Q3. Thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today. We are pleased to report terrific financial performance driven by the consistent execution of our strategic priorities and the ongoing recovery in the global market. In summary, the quarter was highlighted by continued strong sales trends, which we believe led to market share gains, gross margin gains and improved operational efficiencies that drove margin expansion and record quarterly earnings and the effective deployment of capital for growth and productivity investments, bolt-on acquisitions, the dividend and share repurchases. Taking a look at our second quarter financial results, total sales were $4.8 billion, up 25% from last year and improved sequentially from plus 9% in the first quarter. For your additional perspective, our second quarter sales were 12% higher than in Q2 2019. Gross margin was also strong representing our 15th consecutive quarterly increase, and we further improved our productivity with the ongoing execution of expense initiatives. As a result, segment profit increased 35% and our segment margin improved 65 basis points to 9.2%, which represents our strongest margin in two decades. Adjusted net income was $253 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.74, up 32%. Total sales for global automotive were a record $3.2 billion, a 28% increase from 2020 and up 15% from the second quarter of 2019 and marks the first quarter in our 93 year history with auto sales exceeding the $3 billion mark. On a comp basis sales were up 21% and on a two year stack comp sales were up 8.5%. Our comp sales in the second quarter were driven by double-digit year-over-year comp sales in each of our automotive operations. Automotive segment profit margin improved 9.1%, up 30 basis points from 2020 and an increase of 90 basis points from 2019. This expansion was supported by strong operating results across all of our operations. The automotive recovery reflects our focus on key growth initiatives as well as several market tailwinds and these include the broad economic recovery and strengthening consumer demand, favorable weather trends, inflation and our ability to pass along price increases to our customers. Finally, solid industry fundamentals, which have been further accelerated by a surge in used car market and improving miles driven. While these market tailwinds are encouraging, we also see continued headwinds, which we continue to closely monitor. These would include the spread of the deltacoronavirus variant and its potential impact on the global economy, global supply chain disruptions, ongoing labor shortages in our operations and the impact of inflation on our costs such as wages and freight. Turning next to our regional highlights, our GPC teammates in Europe built down there excellent start to the year, achieving the strongest sales growth amongst our operations with comp sales up 34%. Each country posted substantial sales growth, while our UK team continues to outperform. The positive momentum in Europe reflects improving market conditions and favorable weather trends as well as our focus on key sales initiatives, inventory availability, and excellent customer service. In particular, we have seen exceptional results from our key account partners and the ongoing expansion and rollout of the NAPA brand. In our Asia Pac business sales were in line with the mid to high teen comps we have had in this market now for four consecutive quarters. Commercial sales outperformed retail, although both customer segments posted strong growth. The Repco and NAPA brands performed well and collectively are capturing market share. The NAPA network continues to build, and we have now more than 50 NAPA locations operating across Australia and New Zealand in addition to our 400 plus Repco stores. In North America, comp sales increased 20% in the U.S. and we're up 12% in Canada where lockdowns in key markets such as Quebec and Ontario have been headwinds for several quarters now. Sales in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in both the commercial and retail segment with DIFM sales outperforming DIY for the first time, since before the pandemic began to take hold in Q1 of 2020. The strengthening commercial sales environment is significant for us as it accounts for 80% of our total U.S. automotive revenue. The strong recovery in the commercial sector contributed to record average daily sales volume and our U.S. automotive business in June. Our sales drivers by product category include brakes, tools and equipment and under car, which all outperformed. In addition, both retail and commercial ticket and traffic counts were strong for the second consecutive quarter, so another really positive trend. By customer segment, retail sales remained strong throughout the quarter with low double-digit sales growth on top of a healthy sales increase in the second quarter of last year. While the DIY market is pulling back from the highs of 2020, we are optimistic our ongoing investments will create sustainable retail growth. For commercial sales, each of our customers segments posted double-digit growth, which we attribute to the broad automotive recovery and investments in our sales team, our sales programs and our supply chain amongst other initiatives. This quarter, our strongest growth was with our major account partners and NAPA AutoCare centers. We were also pleased with the growth in sales to our fleet and government accounts. This was the first quarter of positive year-over-year sales growth for this group, since before the pandemic as a lag the overall automotive recovery in the U.S. We view this improvement as a meaningful indicator for further growth in the quarters ahead. As the automotive recovery continues, we expect our commercial sales opportunities to outpace retail consistent with the long-term growth outlook for the aftermarket industry. We are confident in our growth strategy and our initiatives to deliver customer value and sell more parts for more cars across our global automotive operations. We also remain focused on enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening in our supply chain and investing in our omni-channel capabilities while expanding our global store footprint to further strengthen our competitive positioning. So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.6 billion, a 20% increase from last year, and up 7% from 2019. Comp sales rose 16% and reflect the fourth consecutive quarter of improving sales trend. A strong sales environment combined with the execution of our operational initiatives drove a 9.5% segment margin, which is up 130 basis points from both 2020 and 2019. The ongoing market recovery over the last 12 months is in line with the strengthening industrial economy and the overall increase in activity we have seen across much of our customer base. The Purchasing Managers Index measured 60.6 in June, reflecting healthy levels of industrial expansion and marrying trends we have seen throughout the majority of this year. Likewise, industrial production increased by 5.5% in the second quarter representing the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion. Diving deeper into our Q2 sales, we experienced strong sales trends across each of our industries served and our product categories other than safety supplies, which add extraordinary sales in 2020 due to the pandemic. Several industry sectors stood out as their sales increased by 30% or more over the last year, including equipment and machinery, automotive, aggregate and cement, equipment rental and oil and gas. In addition, our newly added fulfillment and logistics industry sector experienced tremendous growth. In the past several years of expanding this segment, we have found our broad offering of products and services fits well with the needs of these customers. To drive this growth, we remain focused on several strategic initiatives, which include the build out of our industrial omnichannel capabilities with solid growth and digital sales via motion.com. Our new inside sales center, which was established in 2019, is generating incremental sales from new Motion customers and we see room for further growth. The expansion of our services and value-add solutions businesses in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. Over the last few years, we have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale and continue to target additional M&A opportunities to further enhance our capabilities in these key areas, enhanced pricing and product category management strategies to maximize profitable growth, the further optimization and automation of our supply chain network to improve operational productivity, while delivering exceptional customer service. We are encouraged by industrial strong financial performance in the second quarter and the positive momentum we see in the overall industrial markets. We believe the Motion team is well positioned to capitalize on this momentum and enhance our market leadership position. So in summary, each of our businesses did an exceptional job of operating through the quarter and we couldn't be more proud and grateful for their strong Q2 performance. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Thank you, Carol. We are pleased with our progress in capturing profitable growth, generating strong cash flow and driving shareholder value. This quarter's 25% total sales growth reflects the benefits of a strengthening global economy and positive sales environment in both our automotive and industrial businesses. Importantly, this dual recovery allows us to leverage the full scale of one GPC, which we believe creates significant value. Our team also executed well and produced our 15th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, while further improving our productivity via ongoing expense initiatives. Our global team network and disciplined focus in these areas enabled us to report strong operating results and record quarterly earnings. Our exceptional balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, the investments and organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases. The GPC team is focused on executing our growth strategy and operational initiatives to further enhance our financial performance in the remainder of 2021 and beyond. We thank you for your interest in GPC, and also thank each of our GPC teammates for their continued dedication, passion and commitment to be in the best in serving all our company's stakeholders. So with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Good morning, Chris. Chris, I would add specifically to Motion. We and I think you've alluded to it in the past this recovery that we're seeing in both automotive and industrial. When you look at U.S. manufacturing, our customers are operating at higher run rates. They're accelerating CapEx, plants are returning to full production. If you look at the PMI numbers, you look at industrial production, all is very, very positive. So when you couple that with what we're seeing on capital projects really gaining steam, we're very, very bullish about our industrial business moving forward. Yeah. First, let me just comment on the specific numbers, Chris. So, we wrapped up Q1 with a record sales month for us in March. That momentum carried into Q2. We had a really solid quarter with May, June being our strongest, June being the strongest month and a record month again. And then as we moved into July again pleased to say that that's holding up. So we're really, really encouraged by what we're seeing in U.S. automotive. And specifically to DIY, we're not seeing a pullback in our strong DIY business. We're up low double-digits in Q2 and our two year stack I think raises well over 20%. So our teams have \u2013 as you know, and we've talked about this in the past, we've worked incredibly hard to get our retail footprint in what we believe to be much better in a much better selling mode than we've ever been. So could it pull back a little bit with the lack of stimulus money in the economy, it could be. I think we'll see that perhaps in some of the more retail focused competitors, but now we feel good, we feel good about our DIFM business and our DIY business going forward. Yes. Thanks, Chris. Kate, we have no material exposure to Vietnam. Yes, we hear you, Bret. Hi, Bret, I would also add that it's a very surgical approach by geography, by job type. So we've done a lot of really good thinking and analytics to make sure that we're hitting the areas of the business that are most impacted, but just want to share that perspective. Yes, this quarter, Bret, was unprecedented with the strong double-digit growth we saw across all six of our divisions leading the pack for us as our guys up in the Northeast. But they were impacted the most last year. So it does stand to reason a bit, but really strong performance in the east, going down to the Atlantic. Also pleased though out West in the mountain division, these guys continue to deliver. So top to bottom, the division out of the sixth the \u2013 of the sixth, we had a spread anywhere from 25% to 26% on the top end and 20% on the bottom, so all really, really strong performance across the U.S. You're welcome, Bret. July \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry, Greg. Yes, our DIFM business, Greg, as you heard, is very, very strong and that goes across our major account business, which has really, really bounced back strong. Our AutoCare \u2013 NAPA AutoCare business has really strong. What we're really pleased with Greg is our government in fleet business, which has lagged behind our AutoCare and major account recovery. That business has bounced back with high single-digit growth. So DIFM really continues to carry the load, which by the way we fully expected as the economy bounced back as miles driven really began to ramp back up. Our \u2013 there's so much pent-up demand out there. Our garages are as busy as we have seen them in quite some time. So DIFM continues to carry the weight. And we think as, as we have seen in recent years, DIFM is going to continue to be really strong. Hey, Daniel, I would also mentioned, we're very selective in our M&A targets and I think a couple that were called out were Winparts, which is a online \u2013 a leading online player in Europe and that \u2013 that's \u2013 it's very targeted. We want to further our online presence across our European markets and we found a great partner in Winparts and so more to come on that later. Will and I were actually in the Netherlands last week. Our first international trip in 18 months, spend a half day with this group and very impressive and we think nice upside in the future."

Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're staying safe and well. We are pleased with the strong start to 2021 and ongoing recovery in our automotive and industrial businesses.  The GPC team remain focused on solid execution and in delivering strong financial results through improving sales trends, increasing operational efficiencies and enhancing customer value. Through the quarter, we operated thoughtfully, with the physical and mental well-being of our employees the top priority as our 50,000-plus GPC teammates are the core of our success.  Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 9% from last year, and significantly improved from the 1% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins was also a positive, representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. And our teams in the field continue to do a great job of managing our expenses through ongoing cost actions and the carryover of expense reductions implemented last year. These results drove a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, which is up 180 basis points from the first quarter of last year.  Our strong operating performance drove net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, up 88%. We also continued to fortify our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity and solid cash flow. We are proud of our teams, and we are encouraged by our results, and we intend to build on this momentum throughout 2021.  Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac.  Total sales for global automotive were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and much improved from a 1% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales were up 8%, improved from a 2% decrease in the fourth quarter, and segment profit margin was up 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results in each of our automotive operations.  Sales were driven by positive sales comps across all our operations, with 15% comps in Europe and Asia Pac, 7% comps in the U.S. and 3% comps in Canada. The ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the U.S., improving inventory availability, favorable weather conditions and our focus on key growth initiatives were all sales drivers in the quarter. We would add that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we move through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales.  In Europe, sales were much improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment despite lockdowns throughout the region. In addition, initiatives to grow key accounts enhance inventory availability and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continue to prove effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains. For the quarter, our teams in France and the U.K. outperformed in the region with strong double-digit sales comps. We would also call out a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region. The strong sales recovery, combined with excellent expense controls, produced a 500 basis point improvement in operating margin, so a terrific start to the year for our European operations.  In Asia Pac, our automotive sales remained in line with the mid-teens growth we experienced through the second half of 2020. For the quarter, both retail and commercial sales held strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic. Retail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores continue to outperform, posting a 33% increase in March and plus-24% in the quarter.  Our commercial sales continue to accelerate as well, posting double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at 3x pre-COVID levels. Finally, building on the NAPA brand name has been well received, and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region.  Summing it up, this group continues to perform at a very high level on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in 150 basis point improvement and profit margin for the quarter. In North America, comp sales in the U.S. were up 7%, helping this business post a 180 basis point increase in profit margins. In Canada, we operated through a variety of regional lockdowns, which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. Comp sales were up 3% and operating margin was up 130 basis points.  Sales in the U.S., which posted its strongest quarterly comp since the first quarter of 2015, were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments. This was our first quarter of positive commercial comps since pre-pandemic, and our team produced record sales volumes in the month of March. In addition, both ticket and traffic counts were positive on both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts in several quarters.  By region, the Atlantic, Midwest and West groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also call out our Northeast group, which produced solid growth in the quarter. This is notable that this region of the U.S. has been most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months. Likewise, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment and brakes were strong this quarter. We are especially encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business, which generally is a positive indicator for our commercial business.  On the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth, we continue to drive sales via investments in retail specialists and store refreshes as well as targeted promotions. We would also call out our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the prior year.  For commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers, continued to generate strong growth. We have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving. Clearly, our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the Street has been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA.  We were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA Auto Care and major account customers, which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters. Sales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year, but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. And we look for further improvement in sales to this segment.  As we look ahead, we are excited for the growth opportunities we see for our global automotive segment. We expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet and an increase in vehicles age 6 to 12 years, all favorable for the industry. We can assure you we remain focused on our initiative to deliver customer value and ultimately, sell more parts for more cars. These plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain, and investing in our omnichannel capabilities. In addition, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning.  So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat with last year. Comp sales were down 2%, improved from a 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. March was a breakout month with the North American Motion team posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes. This was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC and our emergence from the pandemic.  The ongoing recovery over the last 9 months is in line with the continued improvement in the industrial economy, which you can see in several key indicators for our business. For perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31. In addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.  Importantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates as well as releasing capital project orders. The strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost, produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year.  Diving deeper into our Q1 sales, we would start by saying that inflation remains a nonfactor in our numbers thus far. That said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers. For the quarter, we experienced improving sales trend among virtually all product categories and industries third. We were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement, and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us.  In addition, we continue to benefit from the build-out of our omnichannel capabilities, with digital sales up 2x from the first quarter in 2020. A key driver of our digital growth relates to our inside sales center, which is generating incremental sales to new Motion customers. While still a relatively small percentage of total sales, we are excited by the potential for future sales growth.  We also remain focused on growing our services and solution businesses to expand our expertise and sales opportunities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. We have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale in these areas, and our services and solutions capabilities remain a key consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the industrial business.  To further ensure profitable sales growth, we continue to enhance our pricing and category management strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to optimize our supply chain network and further improve our productivity while delivering exceptional customer service.  Closing out our industrial comments. We remain bullish about our Motion business, and we are excited to see this team moving back into a growth mode.  So now I'll conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on our ESG initiatives. As outlined in our corporate sustainability report, GPC embraces our responsibility to innovate in ways that provide for our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. In Q1, we expanded our training and development programs to ensure personal growth and enhance our comprehensive well-being program focused on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC teammates. Additionally, we continue to make progress in the advancement of our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are actively recruiting talent that is representative of the communities we serve, training our teammates to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors while strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives.  Finally, we remain focused on our mission to be good corporate citizens where we both work and live. Since 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference, and that legacy continues in 2021.  So now, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?\nWilliam Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter. I'd also like to thank our customers for their loyalty and our suppliers for their partnership. As Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid performance in the first quarter and had strong momentum. The environment has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of doing business each day. Areas of attention for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. We also have more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year. Despite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused to deliver performance.  I'll now share some additional perspective on our strategic initiatives in progress. The foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience and understanding their needs and working to exceed their expectations. We are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and our corresponding strength and opportunities. In the simplest terms, our customers need us to be easy to do business with, reliable and helpful. This independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle in terms of required action and strategic investments.  To deliver a best-in-class customer experience, we have opportunities to simplify and integrate our existing operations. The global teams are executing multiyear plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational productivity and reduce costs. These initiatives will not only create operating efficiency but also enable faster team executions, deliver a better customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. I'd like to highlight a few initiatives that illustrate our efforts to simplify and integrate.  For example, we're working to optimize facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamline back-office support functions, offshore noncustomer-facing functional activities and centralized GPC indirect sourcing processes as a few examples. As we simplify and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future. Our strong cash flow, solid capital structure and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue to make these investments. Key pillars of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging vehicle technologies.  A few highlights of our progress across the key pillars during the quarter include: one, talent. We continue to take deliberate action across the globe to recognize high-potential talent, infuse new capabilities into the organization and recruit diverse talent that is representative of the communities we serve. Examples include category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology and field leadership roles to name a few. Talent will always be a priority area of investment as we strive to be an employer of choice for teammates that share our DPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future.  Two, sales force effectiveness. Data and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, the different needs of each segment, and associated strategies to serve the segment is a foundational element of sales force effectiveness. The sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional selling and digital strategies. As an example, the U.S. automotive team revamped its sales intensity with new reporting and tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales teammates and enhanced virtual product and skills training. In addition, in 2021, the U.S. automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth.  Three, digital. As I mentioned, digital is a foundational priority as we deliver a best-in-class customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. Our businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter. We continue to see strong increases versus prior year across our global digital channels. Digital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales, and we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing. Related, we continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search and other critical customer experience elements such as ease of ordering, pricing and analytics.  Four, supply chain. Our supply chain initiatives are focused to ensure we have the right product available in the right market at the right time. We're continuously executing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics and technology strategies to achieve this goal. One solid example is the success the U.S. industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement. Other select examples would be enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the U.S. automotive business.  Lastly, emerging vehicle technologies. We aspire to lead as it relates to the opportunities that emerging vehicle technologies present for our automotive industries. We believe we have a unique position to leverage, including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer supplier relationships and One GPC team approach. Through our planning process, we developed a multidimensional strategy to address electric vehicle trends. A few select highlights include: the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants. While we acknowledge the focus on critical initiatives that deliver near and medium term performance, we're taking action to build out and act on an exciting future vision.  Lastly, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy. We utilize acquisitions to acquire new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets and our new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities and acquire talent. We also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets. We believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice. We will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy.  Similar to the approach utilized for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams developed tools in a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives. This approach not only helps drive performance, but also helps to share best practices around the globe as One GPC team.  In summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork. We will remain agile as the global environment continues to evolve, and we will remain focused on what we can control as we execute through the balance of the year and beyond.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol to review the financial performance details.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% decrease in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 34.5%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the first quarter last year. Our steady progress and improving gross margin continues to reflect the positive impact of a number of initiatives, including our pricing and global sourcing strategies, and we also benefited from a sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations. We would add that the level of supplier incentives in the quarter were in line with last year and neutral to gross margin. And as Paul mentioned earlier, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our first quarter sales, and this is true for gross margin as well.  As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to drive additional gross margin gains via positive product mix shift, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and also strategic category management initiatives. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year or up 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A. This reflects an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, which is down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year. So tremendous progress and primarily due to the favorable impact of our cost savings generated in 2020 as well as ongoing cost control measures and also improved leverage on our stronger sales growth. Our progress in these areas was slightly offset by rising costs in freight expenses, which we're closely managing; and planned increases in our technology spend, which supports our strategic initiatives, as Will covered earlier.  Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or up 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses. First quarter expenses include the benefit of approximately $20 million related to gains on the sale of real estate and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments that are reported to the other nonoperating income line. All in, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30.0% in 2020.  Total segment profit in the first quarter was $361 million, up a strong 41% on the 9% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase. In comparison to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points. So solid improvement and our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, a reflection of the positive momentum we're building in our businesses.  Our net interest expense of $18 million was down from $20 million in 2020 due to the decrease in total debt and more favorable interest rates relative to last year. The corporate expense line was $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020, due primarily to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustment discussed earlier. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, in line with the reported rate last year and improved from the prior year adjusted rate of 26.5%. This improvement primarily relates to the favorable tax impact of stock options exercise as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments.  Our first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.50. This compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for an 88% increase.  So now let's turn to our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year. Segment profit of $236 million was up a strong 65% with profit margin at 8.0% compared to 5.5% margin in the first quarter last year. The 250 basis point increase in margin was driven by the continued recovery in the automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We were pleased to have each of our automotive businesses expand their margins for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, we're encouraged that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points. So a broad recovery across our operations, and we look for continued progress in the quarters ahead.  Our industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, flat with last year, and improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, which is consistent with the strengthening industrial economy. Our segment profit of $125 million was up 10% from a year ago, and profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year. The improved margin for industrial reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, and is also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So another quarter of strong operating results for industrial, which we expect to continue with stronger sales growth projected through the remainder of the year.  So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and the financial strength to support our growth strategy. At March 31, total accounts receivable is down 27% from last year, which is primarily a function of the $800 million in receivables sold in 2020. Our inventory was up 6% from the prior year, and accounts payable increased 14%. And our AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% in the last year. We are pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position, and we continue to believe we have opportunities for further improvement.  Our total debt is $2.6 billion at March 31, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and down $60 million from December 31, 2020. We significantly improved our debt position throughout the course of 2020 with the issuance of new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provides for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. With these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8x from 2.5x last year. Additionally, we closed the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.1 billion at March 31 last year and in line with December 31.  We also continue to generate strong cash flow, generating $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which is up from $28 million in the first quarter last year. With a strong start to the year, including the increase in net income and the improvement in working capital, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million.  Our key priorities for cash include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. We invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, an increase from $39 million in 2020. Looking forward, we have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year.  As you heard from Will earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names, and we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and industrial segments in the months and quarters ahead.  In the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928, and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. We have actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994. While there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we will resume share repurchases in the months and quarters ahead.  Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, the potential for foreign currency fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainties due to market disruptions such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.  With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus-5% to plus-7%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus-4% to plus-6%. As usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus-5% to plus-7% total sales growth for the automotive segment an increase from plus-4% to plus-6%; and a total sales increase of plus-4% to plus-6% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus-3% to plus-5%.  On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $5.85 to $6.05, which is up 11% to 15% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.75. We enter the second quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol. Looking ahead, the GPC team is excited for the ongoing recovery in the global economy and the growth prospects we see for both auto and industrial. Our strong balance sheet provides us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, and we remain focused on executing our plans to capture profitable growth. Generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value. As a result, we are optimistic that we can deliver strong financial results in the quarters ahead.  So in closing, we want to thank each of our GPC teammates for their continued support, dedication and commitment to being the best.  So thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Can you talk about, well, I guess on a comp basis, I think you have 1 less day. So the reported comps, does that reflect -- are you including that as a headwind? And how would you size it up for each segment? And then just as a follow-up, you talked about record selling performance in Motion in March, I think it was plus 7 on a per day basis. Was there something unique about that performance? And what do that sort of March comp look like on a 2-year basis?\nCarol Yancey: Yes, Chris. On -- you're right. We did have 1 less day in the quarter, and we did not reflect that in our comp sales numbers that are provided. So it would be about 1.5 points for each of our segments equally. The good thing is the rest of the year, we really won't have that. We will close the full year with the 1 less day. But we have not shown that or adjusted for it, if you will, in any of our comp numbers.\nPaul Donahue: And Chris, relative to your question regarding Motion, and thanks for your question on Motion. We always like to talk about our industrial business. We had a breakout month in March. We've been waiting for it, honestly. If you look at all the indicators from PMI to industrial production, they've all been going up into the right. So we knew it was just really a matter of time. Motion got -- they got sidelined a little bit in February with the storm. It's knocked out a lot of our business down in the south, but they came roaring back in March. And honestly, this trend, and we've seen it before with Motion, when they get on a positive trend as they are now, our expectation, that's going to carry through the balance of the year.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then, Carol, on the gross margin, 34.5% in the first quarter and up on a two year basis, some of that is divestiture and so forth. But can you talk about the puts and takes going forward? Do you think gross margin could still see some modest expansion over time given the initiatives that you laid out? Or does DIY versus commercial mix and inflation, keep that more in check?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Chris, I would tell you, we fully anniversaried all the impact of divestitures and discontinued. So that is true core gross margin impact. And we are actually modeling and have been -- given what we did at our February call, continue to model improvement in gross margin for the full year 2021.  It is a function of our initiatives. I mean, you heard Will and myself talk about the number of initiatives. So we have had some great progress in strategic pricing tools and analytics. Our category management, global sourcing. We've had some product mix shifts as well. Our industrial team has done a tremendous job of just quarter-after-quarter increases. Our global sourcing teams, global tenders are really working out well. And we had really kind of a neutral impact on rebates for the quarter. So our full year, we do believe that gross margin will continue to improve and will be up for the full year.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. Then one last quick one. Looking at the balance sheet, I mean, that's -- you haven't -- I don't -- I'd have to look back, but I don't know if you've ever had that much cash sitting on the balance sheet. So typically, you target $50 million to $100 million kind of bolt-ons. Are you thinking something bigger there? Or how are you thinking about the potential to be more aggressive around share repurchase?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. Chris, great question. And I think you're spot on, none of us recall having that much cash on the balance sheet. But as was prudent in 2020, we did look at conserving our cash and sort of prudently got ourselves in a great position. We do expect to return to more normal capital allocation. It is a little bit of a timing thing right now.  So you will see our M&A pipelines, as Will talked about. You will see the bolt-on type acquisitions that will come in. You're going to see our CapEx getting up to the $300 million.  And share buyback, again, we were somewhat precluded from buying in our shares with some of our debt agreements and where we had found ourselves. We expect to be in there buying, honestly, right away. We will do our normal share repurchase. And if we have the opportunity to do more, we'll certainly do that. So more normal capital allocation, and you'll see us putting that cash to use as we move ahead.\nOperator: And our next question is from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich: I had two questions. I wanted to start with the cost reductions. I heard a 500 basis point improvement in labor productivity. And just wanted to sort of understand that and sort of what part could be sustainable if we think about what the sustainable operating margin of the business could be?\nWilliam Stengel: Yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking it. That was a great case study in using technology inside the four walls of a distribution center. As we think about getting more productive with the number of people we have doing the work relative to technology. So think vertical lift modules, et cetera. And that's completely sustainable. That technology and that investment is in the building, and it will continue to improve as we move forward.\nCarol Yancey: And Greg, I would just add a comment on the operating margin improvement. I mean, again, our operating margin outlook in long-term is sort of the 8.5% to 9% operating margin. We're implying about 30 basis point improvement this year in our 2021 results, and that is coming from a combination of gross margin and SG&A. And honestly, that's probably a 50 to 70 basis point improvement over 2019 as well.\nGregory Melich: Right. That's a structural part, effectively, it sounds like. That's great. And to pivot a bit on inflation, I think you mentioned it really wasn't material in the first quarter, but obviously, there's a lot of rise in input costs out there. So I'd just like to know what inflation are you seeing in the COGS or in your guidance are you assuming? And what would you expect that also, what inflation numbers in the top line?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. You're right, we had pretty modest inflation for Q1 and really no impact on our sales or gross margin. As we look ahead, we do think that's going to come and probably more second half-weighted. We're looking at a 1% to 3% on the automotive side and a 1% to 2% on the industrial side. But quite honestly, with our initiatives, we believe we'll be able to continue to deliver on our improvement in gross margin and be able to pass that through. But we have not modeled that, if you will, into our guidance on sales. Quite honestly, if it hasn't hit us yet, we'll look forward to that being a tailwind as we move ahead.\nGregory Melich: Got it. So that's what you think, but it's not in the guidance that by the back half, it would be presumably at the upper end of those ranges you just gave?\nCarol Yancey: That's correct. And you know our back half, we have sort of more normalized growth in the back half. And it's also not modeled into the cost side as well. So we'll update you as we move ahead on what we're seeing on the quarterly inflation, but we do expect it's coming.\nWilliam Stengel: Greg, it's Will. I might just add on the cost side. I mean, I alluded to it in the prepared remarks. But like everybody else, we're watching and seeing SG&A inflation in different parts of the world and in different parts of the business, ranging from wage inflation in selective geographies. You've got global logistics inflation. You've got commodity inflation. So we're watching that and doing good work around being cost productive to offset some of that inflation, but that's definitely something that we're working on actively every day.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKatharine McShane: I wondered if I could just ask about some of the contributors to comp. I know there was improvement in the fleet business. However, it was a drag. If you were able to quantify that.  And you didn't call out regional performance in the South East. And I just thought that would have been a place maybe where you would see more strength, given that it seems more open than the rest of the country at this point. So just wanted to get your comments on that.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Kate, thanks for your question. In terms of the breakdown, fleet did come back in Q1, which I think we referenced that in our last call, we did see an improvement. Our expectation is that fleet will turn positive in Q2 and remain positive through the balance of the year. As you break down the various segments, our retail business was off-the-charts strong. What we were really encouraged by is seeing our both major accounts and NAPA AutoCare center business turn positive, both close to mid single-digit growth in those categories. So yes, we really saw improvements across the board and are especially encouraged to see our heavy-duty fleet business government municipalities turning to a positive in Q2. And as far as regionality, Kate, I think I called out our northern regions. I would also call out -- in that mix, it includes our Atlantic division. Our Atlantic division really led the way in Q1 for us. And Atlantic comes down to the Carolinas, Virginia. So that is close to the south. Our southeast performed just fine, but just was not as strong as what we saw in our northern regions as well as our western region.\nKatharine McShane: Okay. And I was wondering from a, just a follow-up question, you had mentioned that you were successful at signing up more commercial accounts, thanks to your new sales effort. Is there a way to quantify that or compare it to what you've seen in the last couple of quarters?\nPaul Donahue: Well, if you look at our -- what we term other wholesale, Kate, that's -- some describe it as the up and down the street, smaller garages 1, 2 bays. That business was up 7% in the quarter. And again, we have not seen that kind of growth in some time. We know -- we made significant changes and enhancements to our sales force coming out of 2020. We literally have doubled the touch point. And we're getting out and we're seeing those customers, and it's reflected in our business. So we're bullish going forward and really pleased to see the DIFM category bounce back, as we expected it would in '21.\nOperator: And our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. I guess as a follow-up on Kate's question, would you, or maybe more importantly, your customers, attribute improved commercial business that you guys are seeing or saw in the quarter to better consumer mobility? Or given your regional commentary, because it seemed like it was more affected by weather patterns and like the harsh winter, et cetera, that we had?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. I think it's all of the above, Scot. It -- as you know, in these calls, we tend to talk a good bit about weather, and we did see a more normalized winter this year. Certainly, that has an impact on our business. The bounce back in miles driven, while still not anywhere near the levels it was 2 years ago, it is coming back from where we were last year. And then I think the efforts that our NAPA team is making that Will touched on, with the many changes we made in our sales force and how we're going to market. So I really think it's a combination of our sales strategy. Our inventory availability at the street-level has improved. So it's really -- it's not one thing that I would point to. It's really a combination of really positive factors hitting at once. And what I think I'm most encouraged by, Scot, is we had this kind of quarter despite still being in COVID-related lockdowns in many parts of the world. Canada right now, Scot, is, as you would know, is in full lockdown. And yet our business still trended positive in the quarter. Our service levels and our supply from our suppliers is not where it would traditionally be. So look, we're quite proud of the quarter we had, but I would tell you, I think there's even upside when a few of these more headwinds we put behind us.\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes. That's super helpful. And then I know we kind of dug into gross margin, s G&A. I guess my question is, it maybe a little bit more broad here. You guys have had a combination of both permanent and temporary cost reductions. Are there some cost reductions that kind of need to be layered back in? Like you cut back for a period of time. Now that the business is recovering, we got to layer some certain expenses back into the P&L.\nCarol Yancey: Yes. We had -- and it's a great question. As volume comes back, I mean, there is a level of variable expenses that do come back in. But we did permanently lower our cost structure with the 2019 plan that we put in place. And those permanent cost savings, again, we capitalize on those and converted some of the temporary to permanent. So we had about a $20 million benefit in the quarter that was a carryover from those savings. Team's done a tremendous job on payroll. But again, contemplated in our outlook, and I think -- when we came out in February, we had sort of flattish SG&A. And now with the improvement we've seen in Q1, we've contemplated in our operating margin that SG&A does remain and is improved as we go throughout the year.\nWilliam Stengel: Scot, it's Will. I might just add another kind of philosophical point, which is as we do productivity, SG&A productivity work, I mean, our intent is to reinvest some portion of that into growth initiatives and talent, as an example. So we're not solely focused on driving productivity without reinvesting in the business philosophically.\nOperator: And our next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: When you talked about the strength in digital, are you seeing a change in consumer behavior where they're buying online and waiting for shipment? Or is this buying digitally and still expecting either a delivery or a pickup in store?\nWilliam Stengel: I think it's both. I think the -- coming out of COVID, I would say, there has been a dramatic change in the use of digital in every dimension. Meaning frequency, the way in which you use it, and that whole concept of being easy to do business with. And that means different things to different customers. But the foundation of it is having the digital skills to meet those needs as they differ across the customer segment. So I would say it's a mix of everything, and we've done really good work around setting up the foundation of meeting those different needs, and we're going to continue to invest in it.\nBret Jordan: Could you maybe talk about like what percentage of digital is actually still going out the door versus in a box being shipped?\nWilliam Stengel: I'm not sure I have that number in front of me. Let me circle back with you.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then a question on supply issues, and With both Motion and auto I think there have been some -- whether it's batteries or filters, in the first quarter. Are you seeing any stock and availability issues impacting? Or is that pretty much behind us?\nPaul Donahue: No, it's not. I wish it were behind us, Bret. I know you and I talked last quarter and we specifically called out batteries. While that's gotten better, and we had a great quarter in our battery business, there's still some pockets where we're struggling. Filters, you mentioned, could be a whole lot better in terms of our in-stock levels. But we're seeing it in other product categories as well. So that's what I mentioned earlier. I know our -- look, I know the challenges some of our suppliers are up against with raw materials, with the global supply chain, labor issues. When that comes back up to more normal levels, that's just going to be increased upside for our business.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then 1 just housekeeping issue. I guess you talked about off the charts retail. What was the percentage of retail versus commercial, I guess, in U.S. NAPA this quarter?\nPaul Donahue: In terms of -- well, in terms of our percentage increase, Bret. Our retail business was up greater than 20% in the...\nBret Jordan: Just as a percentage of the sales, sort of how the pie gets carved up?\nPaul Donahue: Percent of total, it's still 20-plus percent. It's -- look, we're still going to live and die on the DIFM side, Bret, but it is great to see that retail DIY business continuing to accelerate. And look, we -- as you know, we put a hell of a lot of effort into improving our stores, improving our layouts in our stores, our store hours, our folks in the stores. So we've put a lot of effort behind it, and we've talked a lot about it on these calls through the years. So it's really great to see that segment continuing to perform really well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush.\nPaul Donahue: Maybe we can come back to Seth at the end here. We can keep moving.\nSeth Basham: Can you hear me?\nPaul Donahue: We got you now.\nSeth Basham: Paul, my question is around market share. I don't know if you can quantify how you think that your core NAPA business ex fleet is doing in the U.S. this quarter relative to recent quarters?\nPaul Donahue: Well, look, it remains to be seen, right? So we're the first one out this quarter. We're pleased with our performance and certainly pleased as it stacks up against 2020. We've been waiting for our commercial business to bounce back and really pleased to see that happen in the quarter. So I do believe that was a solid performance. The retail business, I already touched on with Bret, that was solid.  What we're pleased to see what we're pleased to see, Seth, is that the fleet business and what we referenced as our IBS business really beginning to bounce back. So I think we're doing quite well, and I'm really proud of the NAPA team for the quarter they put up.\nSeth Basham: Got you. And I presume that you saw a balance in sales around some of the stimulus check distribution in January, and probably even more so in March for your DIY business. But was there a pronounced bounce around those stimulus check distributions for your do-it-for-me business as well, particularly as you look at the sales trends versus 2019?\nCarol Yancey: Yes. I guess one comment I would say is the trends, and Paul alluded to it, January started off really strong, February was a little softer. March was our strongest month in the quarter, and it was pretty even between the commercial and the DIY. So I think you laid it out as it happened.\nOperator: And our next question is from Brian Sponheimer with Gabelli Asset Management.\nBrian Sponheimer: I'll be really quick. I just want to say hello, but also the investment for next-generation vehicles, be it electric or otherwise, would this also include potentially investing in ways to help with charging stations and support for the fleet as well?\nWilliam Stengel: It does. Yes. I think we're doing a lot of work around all of our choices on this topic. And I think it's important to note, though, just to reemphasize that we are intensely focused on the part that we serve today, the ice engine, is going to be the main focus for us as we move forward. We just think it's prudent to be doing work and understanding the facts and developing strategies as the business evolves. So we're open and looking at everything and refining the strategy as we move forward.\nPaul Donahue: And Brian, I would just add. And first off, good to hear from you again. welcome back. We -- with our presence in Europe, it's -- and the European Union having doubled down on EVs, as Will rightfully pointed out, we're still, majority of the time, focused on our business at hand today with the internal combustion engine. But we do have an eye towards the future. And our European team will be leading -- certainly leading that effort because we believe we'll see it, the shift, the tipping point, if you will, in Europe, most likely before we see it here in the U.S.\nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc.\nDaniel Imbro: Carol, I wanted to start on a follow-up on the guidance. I think you raised full year by about 100 bps. I want to say -- please correct me if I'm wrong. I think the last guidance didn't include any FX tailwinds, which were obviously a nice tailwind to 1Q. So can you maybe just parse out how much of the guidance raise is FX? And then maybe digging into it, have you made any changes to your underlying organic growth guidance for each segment based on the first quarter results?\nCarol Yancey: Okay. Yes, great question. So really talking about our guidance. So the stronger sales and earnings for the full year really reflects our accelerated recovery in the first quarter. So we did consider the favorable FX. We considered some of the other unusual items in the quarter. But we did not, if you will, assume what occurred in Q1 would be baked into those full year numbers for the rest of the year. So we have really taken sort of a more conservative, cautious approach, if you will, on the currency and not model that in. So again, that is contemplated. And then you asked about the same-store sales guidance. So if you look at raising at 100 bps for -- in total and for each segment, we did the same thing on the comp store sales. So plus 4% to plus 6% on automotive and plus 3% to plus 5% on industrial for the same-store sales.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe following up on industrial, Paul, I know you love to talk about it. I think you said last quarter, January was up 1%. I think you guys just said March was up 7%. To get the full quarter down to -- I mean, February was down meaningfully. Is that all just weather driven? Or was there anything else that happened in February as we look at the first quarter industrial results?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. There's not much else for us to point to, Daniel. When -- again, when you look at January, we got out of the gates pretty good, low single-digit increase. And as we mentioned, March was a record month for the Motion team.  February, we were hit hard. We had over 100 branches that were shut down. And I think maybe a better way to look at it is if you were to combine Feb and March together, and that's probably a true picture of the first quarter. But as I mentioned earlier, we've been through this cycle many times with Motion. And when that business turns, the CapEx projects start to move, plants start to reopen, that business really, really takes off. And I will tell you, we're off to a good -- a very good start in April. And our expectation is it's going to continue through the balance of the year.\nOperator: And our last question will be from David Bellinger with Wolfe Research.\nDavid Bellinger: Just to follow-up on that. Yes, just to follow-up on my last question on the industrial side. It seems as though that segment has started to turn the corner in March. Can you talk about the line of sight you have into customer demand over the next several quarters? And are these potential supply constraints allowing for that growth expectation to extend out even into 2022 at this point?\nPaul Donahue: Well, our line of sight, as you know, many of these CapEx projects, there's long lead times with many of these projects. But they are rolling in. We -- I was actually out in the field with our industrial team a couple of weeks ago, first time we've really been out visiting customers. And the universal feedback we get as we visit customers is factories are, right now, they're humming. And if that's happening and they're moving back into full production, that's generally all very, very positive for the Motion business. So our expectation as we look forward with Motion is that we're going to have a solid year. And it's going to continue and should continue on really into 2022. And that's further verified, David, when we look at the PMI numbers and the industrial production numbers all just further support the kind of growth numbers that we believe we'll continue to produce in '21.\nDavid Bellinger: That's very encouraging. And then just on the Auto Parts business, in your prepared remarks, improved inventory availability is noted again this quarter. So can you give us more detail behind that and any ongoing initiatives there? Is there some way to quantify the improvement, either in terms of parts availability or the subsequent lift to sales that you're seeing?\nWilliam Stengel: Yes. It's a great question, and it obviously continues to be a priority focus for us, making sure, as I said in prepared remarks, that we've got the right product in the right market at the right time. So it's absolutely an ongoing initiative.  We are watching and studying improvements in the global supply chain. We are encouraged that it's getting better. And so we are really watching that to improve as we think about, by category, all of the efforts to make sure that we got the right product. So it's getting better, but we're going to have to stay focused on it.\nPaul Donahue: I would also add on to that, David, that we haven't really talked much about our business in Europe here this morning, but our European team had a great quarter, up 15%. And we're making great strides, great inroads across Europe. But I would tell you that I believe one of our -- one of the real pluses for us this quarter was we had product, and we had plenty of inventory, and we had it, as Will said, at the right place at the right time, which I think enabled us to potentially grow outside of what the overall market grew in Europe in Q1. So really pleased with the progress we continue to make in that part of the world.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to management for closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: Thank you. We'd like to thank all of you for your participation in the Q1 earnings call today. We look forward to reporting out to you on our Q2 results, and we appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts company. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carol Yancey",
            "content": "Thank you, Will. We will begin with a review of our key financial information, and then we will provide an update on our full year outlook for 2021. Total GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% decrease in the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 34.5%, a 60 basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the first quarter last year. Our steady progress and improving gross margin continues to reflect the positive impact of a number of initiatives, including our pricing and global sourcing strategies, and we also benefited from a sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations. We would add that the level of supplier incentives in the quarter were in line with last year and neutral to gross margin. And as Paul mentioned earlier, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our first quarter sales, and this is true for gross margin as well.  As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to drive additional gross margin gains via positive product mix shift, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and also strategic category management initiatives. Our selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year or up 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A. This reflects an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, which is down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year. So tremendous progress and primarily due to the favorable impact of our cost savings generated in 2020 as well as ongoing cost control measures and also improved leverage on our stronger sales growth. Our progress in these areas was slightly offset by rising costs in freight expenses, which we're closely managing; and planned increases in our technology spend, which supports our strategic initiatives, as Will covered earlier.  Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or up 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses. First quarter expenses include the benefit of approximately $20 million related to gains on the sale of real estate and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments that are reported to the other nonoperating income line. All in, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30.0% in 2020.  Total segment profit in the first quarter was $361 million, up a strong 41% on the 9% sales increase, and our segment profit margin was 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase. In comparison to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points. So solid improvement and our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, a reflection of the positive momentum we're building in our businesses.  Our net interest expense of $18 million was down from $20 million in 2020 due to the decrease in total debt and more favorable interest rates relative to last year. The corporate expense line was $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020, due primarily to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustment discussed earlier. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, in line with the reported rate last year and improved from the prior year adjusted rate of 26.5%. This improvement primarily relates to the favorable tax impact of stock options exercise as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments.  Our first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.50. This compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for an 88% increase.  So now let's turn to our first quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year. Segment profit of $236 million was up a strong 65% with profit margin at 8.0% compared to 5.5% margin in the first quarter last year. The 250 basis point increase in margin was driven by the continued recovery in the automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives. We were pleased to have each of our automotive businesses expand their margins for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, we're encouraged that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points. So a broad recovery across our operations, and we look for continued progress in the quarters ahead.  Our industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, flat with last year, and improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, which is consistent with the strengthening industrial economy. Our segment profit of $125 million was up 10% from a year ago, and profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year. The improved margin for industrial reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses, and is also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So another quarter of strong operating results for industrial, which we expect to continue with stronger sales growth projected through the remainder of the year.  So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and the financial strength to support our growth strategy. At March 31, total accounts receivable is down 27% from last year, which is primarily a function of the $800 million in receivables sold in 2020. Our inventory was up 6% from the prior year, and accounts payable increased 14%. And our AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% in the last year. We are pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position, and we continue to believe we have opportunities for further improvement.  Our total debt is $2.6 billion at March 31, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and down $60 million from December 31, 2020. We significantly improved our debt position throughout the course of 2020 with the issuance of new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provides for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. With these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8x from 2.5x last year. Additionally, we closed the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.1 billion at March 31 last year and in line with December 31.  We also continue to generate strong cash flow, generating $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which is up from $28 million in the first quarter last year. With a strong start to the year, including the increase in net income and the improvement in working capital, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million.  Our key priorities for cash include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases. We invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, an increase from $39 million in 2020. Looking forward, we have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity. We continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year.  As you heard from Will earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy. We continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names, and we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our global automotive and industrial segments in the months and quarters ahead.  In the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928, and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. We have actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994. While there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we will resume share repurchases in the months and quarters ahead.  Turning to our outlook for 2021. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17, 2021. In arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, the potential for foreign currency fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook. In addition, we consider the continued uncertainties due to market disruptions such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.  With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus-5% to plus-7%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus-4% to plus-6%. As usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we are guiding to plus-5% to plus-7% total sales growth for the automotive segment an increase from plus-4% to plus-6%; and a total sales increase of plus-4% to plus-6% for the industrial segment, an increase from plus-3% to plus-5%.  On the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $5.85 to $6.05, which is up 11% to 15% from 2020. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.75. We enter the second quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul. Yes, Chris. On -- you're right. We did have 1 less day in the quarter, and we did not reflect that in our comp sales numbers that are provided. So it would be about 1.5 points for each of our segments equally. The good thing is the rest of the year, we really won't have that. We will close the full year with the 1 less day. But we have not shown that or adjusted for it, if you will, in any of our comp numbers. Yes. Chris, I would tell you, we fully anniversaried all the impact of divestitures and discontinued. So that is true core gross margin impact. And we are actually modeling and have been -- given what we did at our February call, continue to model improvement in gross margin for the full year 2021.  It is a function of our initiatives. I mean, you heard Will and myself talk about the number of initiatives. So we have had some great progress in strategic pricing tools and analytics. Our category management, global sourcing. We've had some product mix shifts as well. Our industrial team has done a tremendous job of just quarter-after-quarter increases. Our global sourcing teams, global tenders are really working out well. And we had really kind of a neutral impact on rebates for the quarter. So our full year, we do believe that gross margin will continue to improve and will be up for the full year. Yes. Chris, great question. And I think you're spot on, none of us recall having that much cash on the balance sheet. But as was prudent in 2020, we did look at conserving our cash and sort of prudently got ourselves in a great position. We do expect to return to more normal capital allocation. It is a little bit of a timing thing right now.  So you will see our M&A pipelines, as Will talked about. You will see the bolt-on type acquisitions that will come in. You're going to see our CapEx getting up to the $300 million.  And share buyback, again, we were somewhat precluded from buying in our shares with some of our debt agreements and where we had found ourselves. We expect to be in there buying, honestly, right away. We will do our normal share repurchase. And if we have the opportunity to do more, we'll certainly do that. So more normal capital allocation, and you'll see us putting that cash to use as we move ahead. And Greg, I would just add a comment on the operating margin improvement. I mean, again, our operating margin outlook in long-term is sort of the 8.5% to 9% operating margin. We're implying about 30 basis point improvement this year in our 2021 results, and that is coming from a combination of gross margin and SG&A. And honestly, that's probably a 50 to 70 basis point improvement over 2019 as well. Yes. You're right, we had pretty modest inflation for Q1 and really no impact on our sales or gross margin. As we look ahead, we do think that's going to come and probably more second half-weighted. We're looking at a 1% to 3% on the automotive side and a 1% to 2% on the industrial side. But quite honestly, with our initiatives, we believe we'll be able to continue to deliver on our improvement in gross margin and be able to pass that through. But we have not modeled that, if you will, into our guidance on sales. Quite honestly, if it hasn't hit us yet, we'll look forward to that being a tailwind as we move ahead. That's correct. And you know our back half, we have sort of more normalized growth in the back half. And it's also not modeled into the cost side as well. So we'll update you as we move ahead on what we're seeing on the quarterly inflation, but we do expect it's coming. Yes. We had -- and it's a great question. As volume comes back, I mean, there is a level of variable expenses that do come back in. But we did permanently lower our cost structure with the 2019 plan that we put in place. And those permanent cost savings, again, we capitalize on those and converted some of the temporary to permanent. So we had about a $20 million benefit in the quarter that was a carryover from those savings. Team's done a tremendous job on payroll. But again, contemplated in our outlook, and I think -- when we came out in February, we had sort of flattish SG&A. And now with the improvement we've seen in Q1, we've contemplated in our operating margin that SG&A does remain and is improved as we go throughout the year. Yes. I guess one comment I would say is the trends, and Paul alluded to it, January started off really strong, February was a little softer. March was our strongest month in the quarter, and it was pretty even between the commercial and the DIY. So I think you laid it out as it happened. Okay. Yes, great question. So really talking about our guidance. So the stronger sales and earnings for the full year really reflects our accelerated recovery in the first quarter. So we did consider the favorable FX. We considered some of the other unusual items in the quarter. But we did not, if you will, assume what occurred in Q1 would be baked into those full year numbers for the rest of the year. So we have really taken sort of a more conservative, cautious approach, if you will, on the currency and not model that in. So again, that is contemplated. And then you asked about the same-store sales guidance. So if you look at raising at 100 bps for -- in total and for each segment, we did the same thing on the comp store sales. So plus 4% to plus 6% on automotive and plus 3% to plus 5% on industrial for the same-store sales. Thank you. We'd like to thank all of you for your participation in the Q1 earnings call today. We look forward to reporting out to you on our Q2 results, and we appreciate your interest and support of Genuine Parts company. Thanks, and have a great day."

            "name": "William Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter. I'd also like to thank our customers for their loyalty and our suppliers for their partnership. As Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid performance in the first quarter and had strong momentum. The environment has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of doing business each day. Areas of attention for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability. We also have more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year. Despite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused to deliver performance.  I'll now share some additional perspective on our strategic initiatives in progress. The foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience and understanding their needs and working to exceed their expectations. We are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and our corresponding strength and opportunities. In the simplest terms, our customers need us to be easy to do business with, reliable and helpful. This independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle in terms of required action and strategic investments.  To deliver a best-in-class customer experience, we have opportunities to simplify and integrate our existing operations. The global teams are executing multiyear plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational productivity and reduce costs. These initiatives will not only create operating efficiency but also enable faster team executions, deliver a better customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. I'd like to highlight a few initiatives that illustrate our efforts to simplify and integrate.  For example, we're working to optimize facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamline back-office support functions, offshore noncustomer-facing functional activities and centralized GPC indirect sourcing processes as a few examples. As we simplify and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future. Our strong cash flow, solid capital structure and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue to make these investments. Key pillars of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital, supply chain and emerging vehicle technologies.  A few highlights of our progress across the key pillars during the quarter include: one, talent. We continue to take deliberate action across the globe to recognize high-potential talent, infuse new capabilities into the organization and recruit diverse talent that is representative of the communities we serve. Examples include category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology and field leadership roles to name a few. Talent will always be a priority area of investment as we strive to be an employer of choice for teammates that share our DPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future.  Two, sales force effectiveness. Data and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, the different needs of each segment, and associated strategies to serve the segment is a foundational element of sales force effectiveness. The sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional selling and digital strategies. As an example, the U.S. automotive team revamped its sales intensity with new reporting and tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales teammates and enhanced virtual product and skills training. In addition, in 2021, the U.S. automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth.  Three, digital. As I mentioned, digital is a foundational priority as we deliver a best-in-class customer experience and accelerate profitable growth. Our businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter. We continue to see strong increases versus prior year across our global digital channels. Digital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales, and we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing. Related, we continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search and other critical customer experience elements such as ease of ordering, pricing and analytics.  Four, supply chain. Our supply chain initiatives are focused to ensure we have the right product available in the right market at the right time. We're continuously executing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics and technology strategies to achieve this goal. One solid example is the success the U.S. industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement. Other select examples would be enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the U.S. automotive business.  Lastly, emerging vehicle technologies. We aspire to lead as it relates to the opportunities that emerging vehicle technologies present for our automotive industries. We believe we have a unique position to leverage, including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer supplier relationships and One GPC team approach. Through our planning process, we developed a multidimensional strategy to address electric vehicle trends. A few select highlights include: the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants. While we acknowledge the focus on critical initiatives that deliver near and medium term performance, we're taking action to build out and act on an exciting future vision.  Lastly, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy. We utilize acquisitions to acquire new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets and our new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities and acquire talent. We also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets. We believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice. We will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy.  Similar to the approach utilized for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams developed tools in a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives. This approach not only helps drive performance, but also helps to share best practices around the globe as One GPC team.  In summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork. We will remain agile as the global environment continues to evolve, and we will remain focused on what we can control as we execute through the balance of the year and beyond.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol to review the financial performance details. Yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking it. That was a great case study in using technology inside the four walls of a distribution center. As we think about getting more productive with the number of people we have doing the work relative to technology. So think vertical lift modules, et cetera. And that's completely sustainable. That technology and that investment is in the building, and it will continue to improve as we move forward. Greg, it's Will. I might just add on the cost side. I mean, I alluded to it in the prepared remarks. But like everybody else, we're watching and seeing SG&A inflation in different parts of the world and in different parts of the business, ranging from wage inflation in selective geographies. You've got global logistics inflation. You've got commodity inflation. So we're watching that and doing good work around being cost productive to offset some of that inflation, but that's definitely something that we're working on actively every day. Scot, it's Will. I might just add another kind of philosophical point, which is as we do productivity, SG&A productivity work, I mean, our intent is to reinvest some portion of that into growth initiatives and talent, as an example. So we're not solely focused on driving productivity without reinvesting in the business philosophically. I think it's both. I think the -- coming out of COVID, I would say, there has been a dramatic change in the use of digital in every dimension. Meaning frequency, the way in which you use it, and that whole concept of being easy to do business with. And that means different things to different customers. But the foundation of it is having the digital skills to meet those needs as they differ across the customer segment. So I would say it's a mix of everything, and we've done really good work around setting up the foundation of meeting those different needs, and we're going to continue to invest in it. I'm not sure I have that number in front of me. Let me circle back with you. It does. Yes. I think we're doing a lot of work around all of our choices on this topic. And I think it's important to note, though, just to reemphasize that we are intensely focused on the part that we serve today, the ice engine, is going to be the main focus for us as we move forward. We just think it's prudent to be doing work and understanding the facts and developing strategies as the business evolves. So we're open and looking at everything and refining the strategy as we move forward. Yes. It's a great question, and it obviously continues to be a priority focus for us, making sure, as I said in prepared remarks, that we've got the right product in the right market at the right time. So it's absolutely an ongoing initiative.  We are watching and studying improvements in the global supply chain. We are encouraged that it's getting better. And so we are really watching that to improve as we think about, by category, all of the efforts to make sure that we got the right product. So it's getting better, but we're going to have to stay focused on it."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thanks, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're staying safe and well. We are pleased with the strong start to 2021 and ongoing recovery in our automotive and industrial businesses.  The GPC team remain focused on solid execution and in delivering strong financial results through improving sales trends, increasing operational efficiencies and enhancing customer value. Through the quarter, we operated thoughtfully, with the physical and mental well-being of our employees the top priority as our 50,000-plus GPC teammates are the core of our success.  Turning now to our first quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 9% from last year, and significantly improved from the 1% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins was also a positive, representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion. And our teams in the field continue to do a great job of managing our expenses through ongoing cost actions and the carryover of expense reductions implemented last year. These results drove a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, which is up 180 basis points from the first quarter of last year.  Our strong operating performance drove net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, up 88%. We also continued to fortify our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity and solid cash flow. We are proud of our teams, and we are encouraged by our results, and we intend to build on this momentum throughout 2021.  Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter, and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac.  Total sales for global automotive were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and much improved from a 1% increase in Q4 of 2020. Comp sales were up 8%, improved from a 2% decrease in the fourth quarter, and segment profit margin was up 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results in each of our automotive operations.  Sales were driven by positive sales comps across all our operations, with 15% comps in Europe and Asia Pac, 7% comps in the U.S. and 3% comps in Canada. The ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the U.S., improving inventory availability, favorable weather conditions and our focus on key growth initiatives were all sales drivers in the quarter. We would add that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we move through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales.  In Europe, sales were much improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment despite lockdowns throughout the region. In addition, initiatives to grow key accounts enhance inventory availability and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continue to prove effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains. For the quarter, our teams in France and the U.K. outperformed in the region with strong double-digit sales comps. We would also call out a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region. The strong sales recovery, combined with excellent expense controls, produced a 500 basis point improvement in operating margin, so a terrific start to the year for our European operations.  In Asia Pac, our automotive sales remained in line with the mid-teens growth we experienced through the second half of 2020. For the quarter, both retail and commercial sales held strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic. Retail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores continue to outperform, posting a 33% increase in March and plus-24% in the quarter.  Our commercial sales continue to accelerate as well, posting double-digit sales growth in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at 3x pre-COVID levels. Finally, building on the NAPA brand name has been well received, and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region.  Summing it up, this group continues to perform at a very high level on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in 150 basis point improvement and profit margin for the quarter. In North America, comp sales in the U.S. were up 7%, helping this business post a 180 basis point increase in profit margins. In Canada, we operated through a variety of regional lockdowns, which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Que\u0301bec. Comp sales were up 3% and operating margin was up 130 basis points.  Sales in the U.S., which posted its strongest quarterly comp since the first quarter of 2015, were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments. This was our first quarter of positive commercial comps since pre-pandemic, and our team produced record sales volumes in the month of March. In addition, both ticket and traffic counts were positive on both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts in several quarters.  By region, the Atlantic, Midwest and West groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also call out our Northeast group, which produced solid growth in the quarter. This is notable that this region of the U.S. has been most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months. Likewise, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment and brakes were strong this quarter. We are especially encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business, which generally is a positive indicator for our commercial business.  On the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth, we continue to drive sales via investments in retail specialists and store refreshes as well as targeted promotions. We would also call out our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the prior year.  For commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers, continued to generate strong growth. We have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving. Clearly, our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the Street has been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA.  We were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA Auto Care and major account customers, which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters. Sales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year, but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. And we look for further improvement in sales to this segment.  As we look ahead, we are excited for the growth opportunities we see for our global automotive segment. We expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet and an increase in vehicles age 6 to 12 years, all favorable for the industry. We can assure you we remain focused on our initiative to deliver customer value and ultimately, sell more parts for more cars. These plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain, and investing in our omnichannel capabilities. In addition, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning.  So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat with last year. Comp sales were down 2%, improved from a 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends. March was a breakout month with the North American Motion team posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes. This was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC and our emergence from the pandemic.  The ongoing recovery over the last 9 months is in line with the continued improvement in the industrial economy, which you can see in several key indicators for our business. For perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31. In addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.  Importantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates as well as releasing capital project orders. The strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost, produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year.  Diving deeper into our Q1 sales, we would start by saying that inflation remains a nonfactor in our numbers thus far. That said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers. For the quarter, we experienced improving sales trend among virtually all product categories and industries third. We were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement, and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us.  In addition, we continue to benefit from the build-out of our omnichannel capabilities, with digital sales up 2x from the first quarter in 2020. A key driver of our digital growth relates to our inside sales center, which is generating incremental sales to new Motion customers. While still a relatively small percentage of total sales, we are excited by the potential for future sales growth.  We also remain focused on growing our services and solution businesses to expand our expertise and sales opportunities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation. We have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale in these areas, and our services and solutions capabilities remain a key consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the industrial business.  To further ensure profitable sales growth, we continue to enhance our pricing and category management strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to optimize our supply chain network and further improve our productivity while delivering exceptional customer service.  Closing out our industrial comments. We remain bullish about our Motion business, and we are excited to see this team moving back into a growth mode.  So now I'll conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on our ESG initiatives. As outlined in our corporate sustainability report, GPC embraces our responsibility to innovate in ways that provide for our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate. In Q1, we expanded our training and development programs to ensure personal growth and enhance our comprehensive well-being program focused on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC teammates. Additionally, we continue to make progress in the advancement of our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are actively recruiting talent that is representative of the communities we serve, training our teammates to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors while strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives.  Finally, we remain focused on our mission to be good corporate citizens where we both work and live. Since 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference, and that legacy continues in 2021.  So now, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will? Thank you, Carol. Looking ahead, the GPC team is excited for the ongoing recovery in the global economy and the growth prospects we see for both auto and industrial. Our strong balance sheet provides us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities, and we remain focused on executing our plans to capture profitable growth. Generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value. As a result, we are optimistic that we can deliver strong financial results in the quarters ahead.  So in closing, we want to thank each of our GPC teammates for their continued support, dedication and commitment to being the best.  So thank you for your interest in Genuine Parts Company. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. And Chris, relative to your question regarding Motion, and thanks for your question on Motion. We always like to talk about our industrial business. We had a breakout month in March. We've been waiting for it, honestly. If you look at all the indicators from PMI to industrial production, they've all been going up into the right. So we knew it was just really a matter of time. Motion got -- they got sidelined a little bit in February with the storm. It's knocked out a lot of our business down in the south, but they came roaring back in March. And honestly, this trend, and we've seen it before with Motion, when they get on a positive trend as they are now, our expectation, that's going to carry through the balance of the year. Yes. Kate, thanks for your question. In terms of the breakdown, fleet did come back in Q1, which I think we referenced that in our last call, we did see an improvement. Our expectation is that fleet will turn positive in Q2 and remain positive through the balance of the year. As you break down the various segments, our retail business was off-the-charts strong. What we were really encouraged by is seeing our both major accounts and NAPA AutoCare center business turn positive, both close to mid single-digit growth in those categories. So yes, we really saw improvements across the board and are especially encouraged to see our heavy-duty fleet business government municipalities turning to a positive in Q2. And as far as regionality, Kate, I think I called out our northern regions. I would also call out -- in that mix, it includes our Atlantic division. Our Atlantic division really led the way in Q1 for us. And Atlantic comes down to the Carolinas, Virginia. So that is close to the south. Our southeast performed just fine, but just was not as strong as what we saw in our northern regions as well as our western region. Well, if you look at our -- what we term other wholesale, Kate, that's -- some describe it as the up and down the street, smaller garages 1, 2 bays. That business was up 7% in the quarter. And again, we have not seen that kind of growth in some time. We know -- we made significant changes and enhancements to our sales force coming out of 2020. We literally have doubled the touch point. And we're getting out and we're seeing those customers, and it's reflected in our business. So we're bullish going forward and really pleased to see the DIFM category bounce back, as we expected it would in '21. Yes. I think it's all of the above, Scot. It -- as you know, in these calls, we tend to talk a good bit about weather, and we did see a more normalized winter this year. Certainly, that has an impact on our business. The bounce back in miles driven, while still not anywhere near the levels it was 2 years ago, it is coming back from where we were last year. And then I think the efforts that our NAPA team is making that Will touched on, with the many changes we made in our sales force and how we're going to market. So I really think it's a combination of our sales strategy. Our inventory availability at the street-level has improved. So it's really -- it's not one thing that I would point to. It's really a combination of really positive factors hitting at once. And what I think I'm most encouraged by, Scot, is we had this kind of quarter despite still being in COVID-related lockdowns in many parts of the world. Canada right now, Scot, is, as you would know, is in full lockdown. And yet our business still trended positive in the quarter. Our service levels and our supply from our suppliers is not where it would traditionally be. So look, we're quite proud of the quarter we had, but I would tell you, I think there's even upside when a few of these more headwinds we put behind us. No, it's not. I wish it were behind us, Bret. I know you and I talked last quarter and we specifically called out batteries. While that's gotten better, and we had a great quarter in our battery business, there's still some pockets where we're struggling. Filters, you mentioned, could be a whole lot better in terms of our in-stock levels. But we're seeing it in other product categories as well. So that's what I mentioned earlier. I know our -- look, I know the challenges some of our suppliers are up against with raw materials, with the global supply chain, labor issues. When that comes back up to more normal levels, that's just going to be increased upside for our business. In terms of -- well, in terms of our percentage increase, Bret. Our retail business was up greater than 20% in the... Percent of total, it's still 20-plus percent. It's -- look, we're still going to live and die on the DIFM side, Bret, but it is great to see that retail DIY business continuing to accelerate. And look, we -- as you know, we put a hell of a lot of effort into improving our stores, improving our layouts in our stores, our store hours, our folks in the stores. So we've put a lot of effort behind it, and we've talked a lot about it on these calls through the years. So it's really great to see that segment continuing to perform really well. Maybe we can come back to Seth at the end here. We can keep moving. We got you now. Well, look, it remains to be seen, right? So we're the first one out this quarter. We're pleased with our performance and certainly pleased as it stacks up against 2020. We've been waiting for our commercial business to bounce back and really pleased to see that happen in the quarter. So I do believe that was a solid performance. The retail business, I already touched on with Bret, that was solid.  What we're pleased to see what we're pleased to see, Seth, is that the fleet business and what we referenced as our IBS business really beginning to bounce back. So I think we're doing quite well, and I'm really proud of the NAPA team for the quarter they put up. And Brian, I would just add. And first off, good to hear from you again. welcome back. We -- with our presence in Europe, it's -- and the European Union having doubled down on EVs, as Will rightfully pointed out, we're still, majority of the time, focused on our business at hand today with the internal combustion engine. But we do have an eye towards the future. And our European team will be leading -- certainly leading that effort because we believe we'll see it, the shift, the tipping point, if you will, in Europe, most likely before we see it here in the U.S. Yes. There's not much else for us to point to, Daniel. When -- again, when you look at January, we got out of the gates pretty good, low single-digit increase. And as we mentioned, March was a record month for the Motion team.  February, we were hit hard. We had over 100 branches that were shut down. And I think maybe a better way to look at it is if you were to combine Feb and March together, and that's probably a true picture of the first quarter. But as I mentioned earlier, we've been through this cycle many times with Motion. And when that business turns, the CapEx projects start to move, plants start to reopen, that business really, really takes off. And I will tell you, we're off to a good -- a very good start in April. And our expectation is it's going to continue through the balance of the year. Well, our line of sight, as you know, many of these CapEx projects, there's long lead times with many of these projects. But they are rolling in. We -- I was actually out in the field with our industrial team a couple of weeks ago, first time we've really been out visiting customers. And the universal feedback we get as we visit customers is factories are, right now, they're humming. And if that's happening and they're moving back into full production, that's generally all very, very positive for the Motion business. So our expectation as we look forward with Motion is that we're going to have a solid year. And it's going to continue and should continue on really into 2022. And that's further verified, David, when we look at the PMI numbers and the industrial production numbers all just further support the kind of growth numbers that we believe we'll continue to produce in '21. I would also add on to that, David, that we haven't really talked much about our business in Europe here this morning, but our European team had a great quarter, up 15%. And we're making great strides, great inroads across Europe. But I would tell you that I believe one of our -- one of the real pluses for us this quarter was we had product, and we had plenty of inventory, and we had it, as Will said, at the right place at the right time, which I think enabled us to potentially grow outside of what the overall market grew in Europe in Q1. So really pleased with the progress we continue to make in that part of the world."

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report the GPC team capped off a record setting year with a strong fourth quarter highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with continued margin expansion.  We're incredibly proud of the progress in our operations and thankful to our teammates across the globe for their ongoing commitment to excellence.  With the support of strong industry fundamentals and resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses, our teams were focused on executing key initiatives to drive sales growth faster than the market, improved gross margin and enhance operational efficiencies. As a result, we delivered in several key areas in the fourth quarter and full year.  A few highlights in the fourth quarter would include total sales of $5.5 billion up 15%. And our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth. Segment margin of 9.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 up 15% from 2021 and our 10th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth.  For the full year, our strong quarterly performance drove record total sales of $22.1 billion up 17% which follows a 14% increase in 2021. Segment margin of 9.4% up 60 basis points from 2021. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.34 up 21% from the prior year, and a new GPC record. And strong cash flow with cash from operations up 17% and free cash flow up 14% from 2021 levels.  Reflecting on the record year which followed and outstanding 2021, we are confident that our transformation efforts, including the streamlining of our businesses to an automotive and industrial centric business, along with our ongoing strategic initiatives has been highly successful. Throughout 2022, our teams have navigated the dynamics of the macro economy and have continued to deliver market share gains while delivering positive momentum across our core businesses.  We continue to make significant investments in talent and technology to maximize the impact of our key initiatives. As examples, we made solid progress to advance our pricing strategies and optimize our supply chain and network footprint. Our execution in the field has proven effective in driving poor improvement in gross margin and SG&A as well as parts availability, all of which provide additional opportunities for us in the future.  As we build on the competitive advantages of our size and scale, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our product and service offerings and expand our automotive and industrial footprint. As you will hear from Will, last year's acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, has been transformational for our industrial segment. KDG had a significant impact on our industrial performance in 2022. And as elevated our capabilities as a premier industrial solutions provider. Our global automotive teams were also active with acquisitions, including geographic expansion in Europe, with the addition of operations in both Spain and Portugal. For the year, we added 138 net new stores across our global footprint, with the U.S. and Europe leading the way. Looking ahead, we have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and M&A remains an important element of our global growth strategy. As we turn our attention to 2023. While the macro environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our strategic plans to drive ongoing market share gains, with sustained sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow. Looking at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive business is benefiting from several tailwinds, including the geographic diversity of our markets. The increase in vehicle miles driven an aging vehicle fleet and limited new car inventory. These tailwinds are driving steady levels of demand in the aftermarket, with particular strength in the DIFM segment. In industrial, we continue to see solid demand trends with new and existing customer activity and reshoring threat trends, each presenting growth opportunities. We believe this strong performance in our industrial business reflects the diversity of our product and service offerings, as well as our end markets, which all performed well in the fourth quarter. In addition, as you'll hear from Will, our growing capabilities and industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and convenience, are proving to be differentiators for our business. Collectively, we believe these strong fundamentals, combined with a rock solid balance sheet, position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities through both organic and inquisitive investment, while also returning capital to shareholders. So before I close, I'd like to remind our investor community that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor day on Thursday, March 23, here at our headquarters in Atlanta. We will be sharing more about our strategic initiatives and provide an update to our long-term financial targets. We look forward to hosting this event next month and hope to see you all here in Atlanta. We have an exceptional 2022, which included celebrating our 95th year of operations. Our accomplishments as one GPC team are evident in this milestone year. And we are proud to lead a company with such a long and rich history that differentiates GPC across all of our marketplaces. But now I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC team for an exceptional year in 2022, and the hard work to take care of our customers every day. Around the world, our teams are aligned on our strategic initiative pillars that include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging tech.  Investment and focus in these areas translate into a better customer experience, profitable growth, operational excellence and a differentiated team culture. There in 2022, all of our teams made significant initiative progress, and we look forward to sharing more details about our progress and outlook at our upcoming investor day in March. Turning our attention to the fourth quarter performance total sales for the global automotive segment were $3.4 billion, an increase of approximately $243 million or 7.6% versus the same period in 2021. Our sales growth was consistent through the quarter with a solid finish in December to close the year. On a comparable basis automotive sales growth for the quarter increased 8.2%. Our global automotive teams delivered mid-single digit to low digit comp growth across each of our operations. As Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and team execution. For fiscal year 2022, Global Automotive segment sales was $13.7 billion, an increase of 8.9% from 2021. Global automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $295 million and segment operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the same period in 2021. For the year Global Automotive segment profit was $1.2 billion and segment operating margin was 8.7%, an increase of 10 basis points from 2021 and up 110 basis points from 2019. During the fourth quarter, our automotive business experienced mid to high single digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second and third quarters. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management strategic initiatives. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S. automotive sales grew approximately 10% during the fourth quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Sales were strong across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories, with batteries, motor oil, tools and equipment, heavy duty and brakes all posting strong growth in the quarter. The team navigated various extreme weather events in December and kept teammates safe while taking care of customers. Both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low single digit growth. Our commercial business saw sales growth across all customer segments, including notable strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare Network. Over the course of the year, we grew our NAPA AutoCare Network of professional repair centers to record 18,500 customers, an increase of 670 locations, and further expanded our competitive advantage as America's largest network of parts and care. We also continue our investment in the industry as we trained over 34,000 technicians in 2022 and actively support 900 technicians in our apprenticeship program. Other select accomplishments in 2022 include investments in talent, and enhancements to our data analytics and technology capabilities. These enhancements have improved our insights and are driving data driven decisions around strategic pricing and sourcing, which has nicely contributed to margin expansion performance. We've also improved our inventory visibility and are taking action to ensure the right part is in the right place at the right time. We will continue to invest in these capabilities as we move forward. For the full year our U.S. Automotive business grew sales by approximately 11% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. We're extremely pleased with the share gains and record results in 2022. In Canada sales grew approximately 14% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 12%. The results in Canada continue to reflect solid industry fundamentals, strong team execution and market share gains. Our field oriented data analytics to assess and prioritize market customer and network opportunities has delivered returns. In partnership with global teams, the Canadian business also made progress with next drive powered by NAPA, our leading offering that positions repair shops to service hybrid and electric vehicles. In a short period of time, the program has certified over 50 EV technicians, part specialists and service advisors, with plans to have 100 certified service centers and nearly 400 trained part specialists over the next few years.  For the year, our Canadian business grew sales approximately 15% in local currency, with comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter, with total sales increasing approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 10%. For the year our European team delivered sales growth of 19% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. The strong growth in Europe continues to be driven by solid execution and coordinated teamwork across Europe. As examples, during 2022 our European team won business with numerous key customer accounts and continue to gain market share with the rollout of our differentiated NAPA offering across the region.  Sales of NAPA product in Europe reached nearly \u20ac300 million, an annual increase of over 50% from the prior year and now positively contribute to profitability. The impressive growth is a testament to the global strength of the NAPA brand. The next drive rollout is also strong in Europe with approximately 150 certified workshops across 7 countries. In addition, our European bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and expand and add density to our market footprint. Despite a challenging environment, the performance over the last few years has been strong in Europe and the momentum has continued to start 2023. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 10% in local currency from the same period in the prior year with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. For the year, our Australian team delivered sales growth of 12% and comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division delivering profitable growth and share gains. The team continued its impressive performance in 2022 with a 3-year sales stack of more than 30%. Repco's 100-year anniversary in 2022 marked an amazing achievement for this team, and it was only fitting that the team delivered another outstanding year. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $478 million or 29.6%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter with average daily sales growth at or above 30% for all three months of the quarter. Comparable sales growth, which excludes the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 17% in the fourth quarter versus last year. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth.  As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of KDG in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, going forward, KDG sales growth will be included in comparable sales growth. The strong sales growth at Motion during the quarter was broad-based with double-digit growth across nearly all product categories and major industries served with particular strength coming from industries such as automotive, oil and gas, food products and aggregate and cement.  For the year, sales at Motion were $8.4 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 33.2%. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $230 million or 11% of sales, representing a 150 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement at Motion is a result of strong and disciplined sales growth and operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the year, Global Industrial segment profit was approximately $887 million, and segment operating margin was a record 10.5%, an increase of 110 basis points from 2021 and up 240 basis points from 2019.  In 2022, the Industrial segment now represents over 40% of GPC total profit, up 8 percentage points since 2021. For the fourth quarter inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range consistent with the levels we've seen throughout the year. The strong financial performance at Motion is a direct result of their customer and sales intensity, focused strategic initiatives and operating rigor.  During the year, we enhanced our selling capabilities by further leveraging data and technology and continue to expand our value-added solutions offering for our customers. These solutions include products and services in categories like automation, conveyance, fluid power and repair. These categories now collectively represent approximately $1 billion in annual revenue promotion.  In addition, our strategic initiatives around pricing, category management and supply chain are driving increased productivity and profitability, which is reflected in the strong margin expansion delivered in 2022. As we execute on our organic global growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the fourth quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. We also continue to make progress in integrating our strategic acquisition of KDG with Motion. When we announced this acquisition in January of 2022, we communicated a plan for approximately $50 million in annual run rate synergies to be achieved over a 3-year period. We're pleased to report that thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in just the first year with more expected in 2023 and 2024.  Our acquisition pipeline is active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our team delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and record year for Genuine Parts Company. All our business units and geographies exceeded internal expectations, driven by supportive industry fundamentals and the focused execution of our key strategic initiatives. We're excited to build on our momentum, and we look forward to another great year in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams and our outstanding performance, and I'm pleased to share the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results. My comments this morning focused primarily on quarterly and full year adjusted results, which exclude nonrecurring items that I'll cover in more detail shortly.  Total GPC sales were up 15% or $720 million to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects an 11.1% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and an 8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was essentially in line with our assumption for the quarter.  Sales for the full year were $22.1 billion, up 17.1% from 2021. As we continue to invest in organic and acquisitive growth initiatives for both of our segments, it was encouraging to see our core business combined with acquisitions, including KDG, which added more than $1 billion in revenues for 2022 drive strong sales throughout the year.  Our gross margin expanded approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 35.7%, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives that Will mentioned. These initiatives, along with others, contributed approximately 160 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by a few key factors: first, moderating year-over-year supplier incentives pressured gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; second, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial business impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; finally, foreign currency and inflation impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points.  With a strong fourth quarter, gross margin for the full year was 35.1%, slightly above our expectations and essentially in line with the prior year. Our performance on gross margin reflects an excellent job by our team, executing our strategies given the very dynamic market challenges. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding adjustments, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 16.6% from 2021 and a 28.7% of sales compared to 28.3% of sales in the prior year. Our expenses were up in the quarter, primarily due to inflation-driven increases in freight costs and overall investments in IT initiatives across our business units.  For the year, total expenses were $6.2 billion, up 16.2% at a 27.9% of sales, a 20 basis point improvement from 2021. Despite ongoing cost pressures in the fourth quarter, we continue to drive leverage on strong core sales growth across our businesses and execute on our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies.  Segment profit in the fourth quarter was $526 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 9.5%, an impressive 80 basis point increase from the same period in 2021. For the full year, segment profit was $2.1 billion, up 25% on a 17% sales increase. Our segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year and up 160 basis points from 2019, which we believe demonstrates our transformation to an even stronger company and our ability to consistently perform through dynamic economic conditions.  As outlined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter results include three adjustments. The first item relates to a $29 million adjustment to remeasure our product liability reserve. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13 million of costs related to the acquisition and integration of KDG. The third item relates to an $11 million loss on the divestiture of our remaining minority interest investment in S.P. Richards, which was finalized in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, our non-recurring items include these fourth quarter adjustments as well as the 12-month impact of costs related to KDG and a gain on the sale of certain real estate recorded in the second quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share in nonrecurring items I just discussed, was $292 million or $2.05 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $256 million or $1.79 per diluted share in 2021, an increase of 15%.  For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $8.34 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from 2021. Reported net income was $1.2 billion or $8.31 per diluted share. The continued execution of our initiatives allowed us to deliver back-to-back double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 and 2021. With strong earnings growth and improved working capital, we generated $222 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year, a 17% increase from 2021. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up 14% from 2021, and we closed the fourth quarter and year with $2.2 billion in available liquidity.  Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. Our strong performance has allowed us to stay focused on four key priorities for capital allocation, including the reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  For the year, we invested $340 million in capital expenditures, including $96 million in the fourth quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We also invested $3 billion investment in KDG and returned $719 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $496 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $223 million in cash used to repurchase 1.6 million shares. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $8.95, which represents an increase of 6% to 7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022. Our outlook for earnings growth is driven by our expectations for continuous sales growth and another year of margin expansion.  We expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. As we look at the business segments, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% increase in comparable sales. We would add that our outlook for Industrial assumes a much stronger first half relative to the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Turning to a few other items of interest. We will continue to drive growth through the reinvestment in our business and M&A. We currently expect CapEx to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million in 2023, reflecting incremental opportunities in technology and supply chain, among others. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and we'll continue to seek additional bolt-on acquisitions wherever they create value for us.  In 2023, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.80 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing our 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 6% increase from the $3.58 per share paid in 2022 and is above our 20-year average increase of 5.8%.  Our total shareholder return performance of approximately 27% in 2022 placed GPC in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Taken together, we delivered sales growth of 17% and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, so a tremendous year in 2022. Our teams worked hard for these achievements, and we enter 2023 with strong momentum and are well positioned to continue to take share and deliver through an uncertain macro environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year. In closing, as both Paul and Will have mentioned, we look forward to hosting our Investor Day on March 23. We are excited to provide further insights on key growth initiatives, and long-term financial targets and are confident you will find the day informative and productive. We'd love to see you here in Atlanta. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you share some more thoughts on -- in terms of the cadence of the year? I know you talked about the first half being stronger on the industrial side from a comp perspective. I was curious, if you did add KDG into the 4Q comp base, like how accretive would that be? Or how accretive is KDG entering the comp base in 2023? And then on the margin front, do you expect margin expansion both segments in 2023?\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Chris. It's Bert. I'll take that one. I think in terms of the cadence of the year and maybe I'll just pull it up a level and talk about the guidance in general, sure you can appreciate the forecasting environment has its challenges right now, particularly with the mixed macro signals. We're very comfortable with our outlook, 4% to 6% top line, driving EPS up 6% to 7%, and in our range of $8.80 to $8.95. And we do expect margin expansion. That will come from both segments.  We see industrial having a little bit more upside on margin expansion in the auto business, but we'll see nice improvement on both. When we looked at our guidance and talking about the cadence, we really try to be as thoughtful as we can in this environment. We've got solid industry fundamentals for both businesses. We have really good momentum in both businesses coming out of 2022, but we've had two exceptional years. And I think we're in an environment where we all expect, not only GPC, but others growth to moderate a bit and normalize. And I think that's still good, and I think what we're doing this year and what we're forecasting for 2023 is a good outcome.  There are headwinds, and we're staying very prudent with our eyes wide open on the key factors that are out there to watch. We can't ignore that there's recessionary pressure and inflation in the geopolitical landscape around the world are all things we're watching. As we look at the year, we really kind of broke it into two halves. The automotive grows consistently across the quarters. So I think the cadence will stay pretty nice across the year and a few halves are 4 to 6 in both halves.  On the industrial, we're a little stronger in the first half, more high single-digit outlook for the first half for industrial and on the second half, more low single digit. And that's really just some of the uncertainty on that side of the business with some decelerating PMI numbers and things like that. So that's what we can see right now, a little stronger view into the first half and a little less clarity on the second half. And we think that lines up nicely for the full year. Again, KDG has been accretive to the business for the full year. I think you saw in our release and our commentary that we had a nice synergy benefit from KDG, and we'll continue to get good synergy benefits as we look into 2023. So we like that acquisition. It's been a tremendous expansion of capability for the Motion business, and our team at Motion has done an absolutely brilliant job of integrating and executing that acquisition.  So all that taken together, I think we feel really good about where we are. We're very bullish on GPC, and our size, scale and momentum across both segments position us to be successful. And we're going to watch the landscape and continue to stay ready for what comes at us as the macro environment continues to move.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And my follow-up question is on the Motion side. You have a number of different end markets that you pursue, and I know there's some weakness in some of the consumer areas out there on the durable side and you have some of your peers talking about that weakness. So can you help us understand, one, are you seeing any indications of weakness within Motion? And two, how is your mix sort of split out at a more higher level, the capital goods versus sort of consumer discretionary items versus more commodity and sort of ag type businesses?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Chris, it's Will. Let me see if I can add some color to that. So as we commented in the prepared remarks, we really do continue to see very broad-based strength across our end markets to give you some perspective. I mean we have, call it, 15 different industries that we would describe as our top industries. The range of performance for the fourth quarter and the industries range from high single digits to over 35%.  So -- and then I think we said in our comments through the quarter, the 30% per month comp where growth rate was pretty consistent as well. So it's consistent and broad. This is a B2B business. So it is quite industrial and less consumer-oriented. There are a couple categories or industries here that perhaps you could extend to a broader consumer dynamic, lumber and wood be one, things around the construction industries. Those, if we had to point out one area of weakness to start the year, we saw some relative weakness there. I don't know if that's residential, commercial, real estate markets changing on us. But again, generally, it's a very industrial, non-consumer oriented B2B type of business that's very well diversified.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. And Chris, I would just add. I think as you look at our more traditional end markets, food products, iron and steel, aggregate, automotive, all up well into the double digits in Q4. So as both Will and Bert had said, we remain incredibly bullish about our industrial business. I'm pleased to say, we're seeing double-digit growth right out of the blocks here in Q1. So yes, we're going to -- we're just going to keep on pressing forward. And look, there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the future. You've got manufacturing returning to the U.S., a lot of onshoring, reshoring. You've got a lot of investments in semiconductors, energy, battery storage, mining, all of which play to our strength.\nChristopher Horvers: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much. \nOperator: The next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nKate McShane: Hi, thanks. Good morning. And thanks for taking our questions. I just had two questions. One with regards to operating expenses and some of your commentary around CapEx. I just wondered with regards to operating expenses in '23, what you're anticipating for freight and investments in IT? And how that will look in '23 versus '22? And if there are some examples of the ongoing tech investment in the CapEx spend that was noted today?\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Kate. Appreciate the question and give you some color on '23 as we're looking at OpEx and CapEx side. On the OpEx, we are expecting a little bit of deleverage next year. We're going to invest in the cycle here, really focused on the long term on tech and talent. I know you asked about freight. We will see a little pressure there in inflationary pressure like we saw in the fourth quarter on freight, but we expect that to abate as we get into the second half of the year.  But back on our two big investments for next year, tech and talent, it's a competitive marketplace out there, and we're thinking about the long term. So on the talent side, we're making some smart investments in the business with our teams. We'll see a mid-single-digit wage increase this year a tiny bit higher than 2022, and we're going to absorb some costs, particularly on the health care side. Health care inflation is pretty prolific, and we're going to absorb some of that cost at corporate.  So we think those are the right investments for our team. The impact of 2023 of that basket of activities is about 30 basis points of deleverage on SG&A. And on the IT side, we're making investments that we need to make in the business to improve our capabilities, and this is really about modernizing our platforms. These are investments in data analytics, AI and new systems and some of those are pivoting to cloud-based systems, and those costs can't be capitalized.  So we feel good about those investments and what they do for our business. It allows us to go faster. And those investments we think driving leverage -- will be driving leverage outside of those investments and focus on efficiencies. So if you take those out, we'd be levering the business. The IT investment is about 30 basis points as well and our guide reflects all of this. And so we feel good about that as well. On capital, we'll see a little bit of an increase in capital next year, not outsized increase at the low end of our range, 10%. Again, we're very energized about where we're focused on the business in terms of opportunities for automation and modernization of DCs in the supply chain, and again, on IT. There's IT as platform investments and things that we want to do that we see benefit in. Many of those projects on the supply chain allow us to consolidate and close old DCs, and you can imagine that's kind of big benefit. And so taken all together, we think these are the right things to do for next year. We're still expecting margin expansion and a topline guide of 6% to 7%. So we think all of that together makes the right sense for where we are.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nGreg Melich: Thanks. Just wanted to clarify that last question, and then I had a follow-up on inflation demand. The 30 and the 30 bps or 60 bps of OpEx headwind, presumably that's offset by more than 60 bps of gross margin expansion, and what\u2019s driving that?\nBert Nappier: Yes. So on the margin side, we're going to carry the momentum that we had in the fourth quarter. Our teams are doing absolutely reliant job of executing our core strategies on pricing and sourcing capabilities. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about a 160 basis point increase in the fourth quarter just from the execution of category management, pricing and sourcing activities, that's going to continue. We expect that to continue into 2023, and so that success is what we have in our forecast.  We're looking for gross margins to be up in the range of 20 to 40 basis points for 2023. We don't really see a lot of headwind there. Anything in terms of what we're looking at from FX or inflation or any of that, it's pretty negligible at this point. So we're bullish on our execution of our gross margin activities and that helps us expand margin overall.  The SG&A impact on those two investment side are offset by other efficiencies. So when you look at the full year, we expect deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points in total. I gave you 60 basis points of deleverage, and so you'll see that we're making some ground up in driving leverage outside of those two investment categories where we can be more efficient and smarter in the business.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then my question on top line isn't -- inflation last year, I think in the Paul what you said it was mid-single to high single, so let's call it 6% or 7% in auto and low singles in industrial. What's in your assumption this year when you did your 4% to 6% guide for each business?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So inflation, just to kind of talk about it trend-wise, our view is that it moderated in the fourth quarter. It ticked down slightly from Q3, and that monetary policy in the U.S. is working. It's having an effect around the world, but it does take some time all about the flow through supply chain and through the businesses. So as you said, Q4 and FY '22 inflation levels overall were mid-single digits. High single digits in auto and low single digits in industrial.  And as we look to '23, we expect for it to continue to moderate for the full year. We think monetary policy works and will work. We were at a peak of 9.1% in June. We had 7 straight months of easing. And when we look at that, the way we kind of thought about our forecast for the full year is that the full year would be at a low single-digit all up, remaining at low single digits for industrial and low single digit for auto.  That obviously ticks down across the course of the year. So we step down Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 as monetary policy continues to have an impact. Again, it's a little bit of a wildcard, and we have to make an assumption when we give our guide, which is what we've done. So we'll still be watching the effect of monetary policy and other actions, but that's our assumption based. Q1, just to be specific, we'll tick down from where we are to mid-single digit, I think, for auto. Industrial stays at low single digit and all up mid-single digits in Q1.\nGreg Melich: That's perfect. And then last, just DIY and do-it-for-me. Do-it-for-me still outpacing DIY by about 1,000 basis points. Is that the trend you're expecting this year to continue? Or are we seen enough recovery in fleet and other that maybe those start to narrow?\nWill Stengel: I think they start to narrow, and so we would expect the DIY business. We're seeing some good strength in our DIY business, in particular, our accessories, which is a small part of the business, but it continues to grow really nicely even on tougher comps. So we would expect the gap to narrow as we go through 2023.\nGreg Melich: Congrats guys on a good year. And good luck.\nOperator: The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Please go ahead. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. First question is, you have made a couple of comments on the gross margin benefits you've been able to accrue from pricing. Is that both in auto and industrial? And then if at least some of it is in auto, could some of those price increases create some competitive challenges down the road since some of your other major competitors have made selective price investments over the last 1.5 years to 2 years?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Scot, it's Will. I'll take a cut at this. We're seeing great pricing work happening on both sides of the business, and in particular, in U.S. automotive. I would say, they're one of the most dynamic teams in terms of the things that they're doing around pricing. We've been at this now for 12 to 18 months in a pretty robust way, both in terms of the technology that we're using, the data, working with a third party, et cetera.  And we are actively thinking through the right way to execute pricing strategies relative to the market. That's really at the core of the work that we're doing. So we feel good about what we're doing. We study it daily. It's at the SKU level. We go into different markets, and we've got really nice visibility to react accordingly with dashboards and weekly updates as a team to make sure that what we're doing is beneficial for our customers and our business. So it's definitely something that we're hyper focused on.\nPaul Donahue: And Scot, I would just add to that, that we're -- despite what you may be hearing in the marketplace, the pricing environment overall as it generally has been in automotive is rational, we're not seeing any huge swings one way or the other. And as you well know, having the product on the shelf and available when the customer needs it is still the primary driver and not necessarily price.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the industrial side. I mean the comp performance of the industrial piece segment rather has continued to significantly outpace the indexes. It's historically tracked really over the last, call it, 15 to 18 months. And Paul, I think you've mentioned, some of it is kind of the changing business mix that you previously highlighted. Are there other factors we should be thinking about to kind of explain the divergence from, let's call it, historical trend that we've seen?\nPaul Donahue: I don't think so, Scot. I know you and I talked about it on the last call. Look, we're not totally insulated from the effects of a downturn in PMI or industrial production. But I would tell you, we are a whole lot more confident today given the diversity of our product and our service offering, the end markets we're servicing, things like EV manufacturing plant.  I mentioned earlier, the opportunity with onshore, nearshore and manufacturing coming back to the U.S. So all of that bodes very well for Motion. And we've evolved, I guess, Scot -- my time here, we've evolved from being a -- basically a distributor of bearings and industrial supplies to a really world-class industrial solutions provider, one who provides solutions in automation, robotics, conveyance, hydraulics, fluid power. So look, we're not totally immune to what's happening in manufacturing, but I like our business, I like our team and I like our chances. And again, we're off to another really good start here in Q1.\nWill Stengel: Scot, I might just add one other thought, which is the momentum that's behind the KDG and the Motion combination. We get very active and positive feedback from customers on kind of the breadth and depth of the service offering, the value-add services. And I think that's really extended the leadership position of the combined business over the last 12 months.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thanks. Very helpful guys. \nOperator: And the next question is from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nLiz Suzuki: Thank you. I was hoping you could just comment a little bit about your leverage ratio, which is a bit below target. Are you kind of holding on to some dry powder so that if attractive acquisitions or buyback opportunities come up, you could act on that opportunity without taking on high rate debt? Or is there some hesitancy maybe about the economic outlook that's keeping you more conservative on leverage?\nPaul Donahue: Liz, you're exactly right. We're being a little conservative here. We're holding some dry powder. Look, we are at 1.7 times, well below our stated range of 2 to 2.5 times. And we like that position. We think that it's really smart right now in this environment. We'll look for opportunistic things across the board whether it's CapEx or M&A. And so we really do think that we've been able to work that down post KDG acquisition right after we bought KDG earlier in the year, we were closer to 2.  So I think nice performance to work it back down. And look across the landscape or whatever we might see come up. So nothing pressing or imminent, but we just like the financial flexibility that we have with our current cash balance, our total liquidity and being very disciplined across our capital allocation structure.\nLiz Suzuki: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nBret Jordan: Good morning, guys. On the NAPA private label program in Europe, you said, I think, what, \u20ac300 million you're doing. Could you talk about sort of what inning you are in and penetrating there? I mean how many segments that you think you're going to run private label versus how many you're doing or what the potential market is?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Bret, let me take a pass at that. We're in the very early innings Obviously, the last 12 to 18 months has delivered really strong momentum. We're excited about that. We fully expect to continue to do that. We're in, call it, 10 to 15 categories. We've got opportunities to do more than that. Within the categories that we actually offer that doesn't necessarily mean they're in each one of our local markets. So even if we just stayed in our 10 to 15 primary categories, we'd have a great opportunity to continue to push that product. But we're excited about this and believe that it can be close to 20% of the revenue over the next 2 to 3 years.\nPaul Donahue: Bret, I know we got into this discussion last time we were together. And so I would tell you, I think we're at about the bottom of the third, Bret, in terms of our process here in private label. It's going extremely well. All the countries have jumped on board, and we haven't even rolled it out yet to the new markets we entered last year, Spain and Portugal. So yes, we're excited, and I know the team is excited. And the best part is, our customers and the consumers are buying the product, and they love the product.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Great. And then on the U.S. acquisition, you're talking about folding in some store acquisitions. Could you talk about what you're looking at there? Are these NAPA-independents? Are these other independents in other buying groups, and I guess, sort of which regions are these, more urban company-owned store markets you're looking at? Sort of what's the strategy on increasing this company-owned store base?\nWill Stengel: It's a great question. The short answer is, it's always the above on the store base. So a lot of thought has gone into the markets in which we want to add relative density. And so depending on the best way to do that, we'll consider either working with an independent owner or if it's another competitive store group, we'll consider that. But as you alluded to, it's strategic markets, adding that density, making sure that we've got the ability to cover customers well with the right inventory mix, and it's a very attractive ROIC lever for us as we bring a lot of value to those merged entities after we own.\nBret Jordan: Are there any particular regions you're looking at? Or is this sort of national?\nWill Stengel: It's a national approach. We're doing it. It's the same M&A strategy, quite frankly, globally for our automotive business. We do the same work in Canada, and we did the same work in Europe as we do here in the U.S.\nBret Jordan: If you were to roll that forward, if you're sort of thinking out three to five years, is it a meaningful change in company-owned store mix versus independent?\nWill Stengel: It has the potential to be. It will take some time just given the law of numbers, but that is a lever that we have to change that mix, for sure.\nOperator: And the next question is from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. \nJoe Enderlin: This is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel. Looking at the industrial space, I think you noted reshoring as a tailwind in the prepared remarks and previous questions. Could you maybe provide some more thoughts on how you expect this to impact profitability or how you're thinking about the effects of reshoring?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. So thanks for the question, Joe. And look, it's a reality, and there's a number of reports that we've all reviewed of late commenting on the number of CEOs that are considering and have begun considering bringing manufacturing back here, not only the U.S., but across North America. And certainly, Mexico would be a part of that where we have a strong presence with the Motion business.  So look, it's a positive. It's more long -- it's certainly more long range. It's not going to -- certainly not going to happen overnight. But again, I think as these companies do return to North America, automation is going to play a significant role given some of the labor challenges and labor shortages. So automation in these operations is going to be significant, and again, we are extremely well positioned as it relates to our automation and robotics offerings.\nJoe Enderlin: That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, you noted you realized there were $30 million of synergies from the KDG acquisition with more expected in '23 and '24. Just to clarify, were these mainly revenue or cost synergies? And then what are the primary drivers here? And then do you maybe think there might be any upside to the $50 million goal?\nWill Stengel: Yes. The synergies are in both buckets. So we have net sales synergies as well as cost synergies. So they interplay together. We do think there's some upside as we move forward. The business has really nice momentum. We committed to $50 million when we originally announced the transaction by year three. We're in a position to deliver $50 million by the end of year two. So with $30 million realized through year 1, an incremental $20 million in year 2. And I'm confident that the team will execute well and deliver on that commitment and potentially more.\nJoe Enderlin: That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question and that question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush. Please go ahead. \nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. Nice quarter. I have a couple of questions about the core U.S. NAPA business. First, regarding the fourth quarter results, you mentioned strength finished the quarter. I presume weather helped. I'm wondering if you can quantify how much weather was a help, and how you're thinking about weather for the first quarter and 2023.\nWill Stengel: Yes, Seth, I would -- its Will. I would say that weather might have helped slightly, but not material to close the year. As we look forward, it's currently 80 degrees here in Atlanta. There's a couple of feet of snow in different parts of the country. It's hard to predict. I would tell you, January feels like -- certainly, in our North American market, it's been a mild winter that had some implications for some of our product categories, but I'm confident the team is going to work through that. We can't control it. So we're going to focus on what we can control and make sure that we're taking care of our customers and our teammates safely.\nSeth Basham: Fair enough. And then as you're thinking about the U.S. NAPA sales growth in comps in 2023, is that within the same 4% to 6% range that you're expecting for the global business?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Seth, this is Bert. That's right. We're thinking about that total automotive segment out of 4% to 6%. And within that, we would be in the same range for the U.S. business.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Okay. And then lastly, in terms of the miles driven outlook, how are you thinking about miles driven and obviously, a key driver of U.S. NAPA of sales?\nPaul Donahue: Well, I would tackle that, Seth. We're hoping to see a little bit of a lift, which we did see in the latter part of the year as fuel prices started to abate a bit here in the U.S. So I still think there's a bit of a reluctance for mass transit, not to mention air travel and air fares are at all-time high. So I think that a 1% lift would not be out of the realm of possibility. So we think it will be a tailwind in '23, for sure.\nSeth Basham: Wonderful. Thank you very much for your answers. And good luck.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Chad. We appreciate it. Appreciate all the questions and everyone joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're incredibly pleased with the reported record year for GPC, and we could not be prouder of the great work done by all of our teammates around the world. We continue to be excited with the momentum this business continues to generate, and I would just conclude by saying, the future is very, very bright for GPC. So I hope you all have a great day wherever you are, and hope to see you at our Investor Day meeting here in March. All the best.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC team for an exceptional year in 2022, and the hard work to take care of our customers every day. Around the world, our teams are aligned on our strategic initiative pillars that include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging tech.  Investment and focus in these areas translate into a better customer experience, profitable growth, operational excellence and a differentiated team culture. There in 2022, all of our teams made significant initiative progress, and we look forward to sharing more details about our progress and outlook at our upcoming investor day in March. Turning our attention to the fourth quarter performance total sales for the global automotive segment were $3.4 billion, an increase of approximately $243 million or 7.6% versus the same period in 2021. Our sales growth was consistent through the quarter with a solid finish in December to close the year. On a comparable basis automotive sales growth for the quarter increased 8.2%. Our global automotive teams delivered mid-single digit to low digit comp growth across each of our operations. As Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and team execution. For fiscal year 2022, Global Automotive segment sales was $13.7 billion, an increase of 8.9% from 2021. Global automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $295 million and segment operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the same period in 2021. For the year Global Automotive segment profit was $1.2 billion and segment operating margin was 8.7%, an increase of 10 basis points from 2021 and up 110 basis points from 2019. During the fourth quarter, our automotive business experienced mid to high single digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second and third quarters. We continue to be pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management strategic initiatives. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S. automotive sales grew approximately 10% during the fourth quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Sales were strong across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories, with batteries, motor oil, tools and equipment, heavy duty and brakes all posting strong growth in the quarter. The team navigated various extreme weather events in December and kept teammates safe while taking care of customers. Both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low single digit growth. Our commercial business saw sales growth across all customer segments, including notable strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare Network. Over the course of the year, we grew our NAPA AutoCare Network of professional repair centers to record 18,500 customers, an increase of 670 locations, and further expanded our competitive advantage as America's largest network of parts and care. We also continue our investment in the industry as we trained over 34,000 technicians in 2022 and actively support 900 technicians in our apprenticeship program. Other select accomplishments in 2022 include investments in talent, and enhancements to our data analytics and technology capabilities. These enhancements have improved our insights and are driving data driven decisions around strategic pricing and sourcing, which has nicely contributed to margin expansion performance. We've also improved our inventory visibility and are taking action to ensure the right part is in the right place at the right time. We will continue to invest in these capabilities as we move forward. For the full year our U.S. Automotive business grew sales by approximately 11% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. We're extremely pleased with the share gains and record results in 2022. In Canada sales grew approximately 14% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 12%. The results in Canada continue to reflect solid industry fundamentals, strong team execution and market share gains. Our field oriented data analytics to assess and prioritize market customer and network opportunities has delivered returns. In partnership with global teams, the Canadian business also made progress with next drive powered by NAPA, our leading offering that positions repair shops to service hybrid and electric vehicles. In a short period of time, the program has certified over 50 EV technicians, part specialists and service advisors, with plans to have 100 certified service centers and nearly 400 trained part specialists over the next few years.  For the year, our Canadian business grew sales approximately 15% in local currency, with comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter, with total sales increasing approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 10%. For the year our European team delivered sales growth of 19% with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. The strong growth in Europe continues to be driven by solid execution and coordinated teamwork across Europe. As examples, during 2022 our European team won business with numerous key customer accounts and continue to gain market share with the rollout of our differentiated NAPA offering across the region.  Sales of NAPA product in Europe reached nearly \u20ac300 million, an annual increase of over 50% from the prior year and now positively contribute to profitability. The impressive growth is a testament to the global strength of the NAPA brand. The next drive rollout is also strong in Europe with approximately 150 certified workshops across 7 countries. In addition, our European bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and expand and add density to our market footprint. Despite a challenging environment, the performance over the last few years has been strong in Europe and the momentum has continued to start 2023. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 10% in local currency from the same period in the prior year with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. For the year, our Australian team delivered sales growth of 12% and comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division delivering profitable growth and share gains. The team continued its impressive performance in 2022 with a 3-year sales stack of more than 30%. Repco's 100-year anniversary in 2022 marked an amazing achievement for this team, and it was only fitting that the team delivered another outstanding year. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $478 million or 29.6%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter with average daily sales growth at or above 30% for all three months of the quarter. Comparable sales growth, which excludes the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 17% in the fourth quarter versus last year. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth.  As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of KDG in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, going forward, KDG sales growth will be included in comparable sales growth. The strong sales growth at Motion during the quarter was broad-based with double-digit growth across nearly all product categories and major industries served with particular strength coming from industries such as automotive, oil and gas, food products and aggregate and cement.  For the year, sales at Motion were $8.4 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 33.2%. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $230 million or 11% of sales, representing a 150 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement at Motion is a result of strong and disciplined sales growth and operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the year, Global Industrial segment profit was approximately $887 million, and segment operating margin was a record 10.5%, an increase of 110 basis points from 2021 and up 240 basis points from 2019.  In 2022, the Industrial segment now represents over 40% of GPC total profit, up 8 percentage points since 2021. For the fourth quarter inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low single-digit range consistent with the levels we've seen throughout the year. The strong financial performance at Motion is a direct result of their customer and sales intensity, focused strategic initiatives and operating rigor.  During the year, we enhanced our selling capabilities by further leveraging data and technology and continue to expand our value-added solutions offering for our customers. These solutions include products and services in categories like automation, conveyance, fluid power and repair. These categories now collectively represent approximately $1 billion in annual revenue promotion.  In addition, our strategic initiatives around pricing, category management and supply chain are driving increased productivity and profitability, which is reflected in the strong margin expansion delivered in 2022. As we execute on our organic global growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the fourth quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. We also continue to make progress in integrating our strategic acquisition of KDG with Motion. When we announced this acquisition in January of 2022, we communicated a plan for approximately $50 million in annual run rate synergies to be achieved over a 3-year period. We're pleased to report that thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in just the first year with more expected in 2023 and 2024.  Our acquisition pipeline is active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our team delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and record year for Genuine Parts Company. All our business units and geographies exceeded internal expectations, driven by supportive industry fundamentals and the focused execution of our key strategic initiatives. We're excited to build on our momentum, and we look forward to another great year in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Yes, Chris, it's Will. Let me see if I can add some color to that. So as we commented in the prepared remarks, we really do continue to see very broad-based strength across our end markets to give you some perspective. I mean we have, call it, 15 different industries that we would describe as our top industries. The range of performance for the fourth quarter and the industries range from high single digits to over 35%.  So -- and then I think we said in our comments through the quarter, the 30% per month comp where growth rate was pretty consistent as well. So it's consistent and broad. This is a B2B business. So it is quite industrial and less consumer-oriented. There are a couple categories or industries here that perhaps you could extend to a broader consumer dynamic, lumber and wood be one, things around the construction industries. Those, if we had to point out one area of weakness to start the year, we saw some relative weakness there. I don't know if that's residential, commercial, real estate markets changing on us. But again, generally, it's a very industrial, non-consumer oriented B2B type of business that's very well diversified. Thanks, Kate. Appreciate the question and give you some color on '23 as we're looking at OpEx and CapEx side. On the OpEx, we are expecting a little bit of deleverage next year. We're going to invest in the cycle here, really focused on the long term on tech and talent. I know you asked about freight. We will see a little pressure there in inflationary pressure like we saw in the fourth quarter on freight, but we expect that to abate as we get into the second half of the year.  But back on our two big investments for next year, tech and talent, it's a competitive marketplace out there, and we're thinking about the long term. So on the talent side, we're making some smart investments in the business with our teams. We'll see a mid-single-digit wage increase this year a tiny bit higher than 2022, and we're going to absorb some costs, particularly on the health care side. Health care inflation is pretty prolific, and we're going to absorb some of that cost at corporate.  So we think those are the right investments for our team. The impact of 2023 of that basket of activities is about 30 basis points of deleverage on SG&A. And on the IT side, we're making investments that we need to make in the business to improve our capabilities, and this is really about modernizing our platforms. These are investments in data analytics, AI and new systems and some of those are pivoting to cloud-based systems, and those costs can't be capitalized.  So we feel good about those investments and what they do for our business. It allows us to go faster. And those investments we think driving leverage -- will be driving leverage outside of those investments and focus on efficiencies. So if you take those out, we'd be levering the business. The IT investment is about 30 basis points as well and our guide reflects all of this. And so we feel good about that as well. On capital, we'll see a little bit of an increase in capital next year, not outsized increase at the low end of our range, 10%. Again, we're very energized about where we're focused on the business in terms of opportunities for automation and modernization of DCs in the supply chain, and again, on IT. There's IT as platform investments and things that we want to do that we see benefit in. Many of those projects on the supply chain allow us to consolidate and close old DCs, and you can imagine that's kind of big benefit. And so taken all together, we think these are the right things to do for next year. We're still expecting margin expansion and a topline guide of 6% to 7%. So we think all of that together makes the right sense for where we are. I think they start to narrow, and so we would expect the DIY business. We're seeing some good strength in our DIY business, in particular, our accessories, which is a small part of the business, but it continues to grow really nicely even on tougher comps. So we would expect the gap to narrow as we go through 2023. Yes, Scot, it's Will. I'll take a cut at this. We're seeing great pricing work happening on both sides of the business, and in particular, in U.S. automotive. I would say, they're one of the most dynamic teams in terms of the things that they're doing around pricing. We've been at this now for 12 to 18 months in a pretty robust way, both in terms of the technology that we're using, the data, working with a third party, et cetera.  And we are actively thinking through the right way to execute pricing strategies relative to the market. That's really at the core of the work that we're doing. So we feel good about what we're doing. We study it daily. It's at the SKU level. We go into different markets, and we've got really nice visibility to react accordingly with dashboards and weekly updates as a team to make sure that what we're doing is beneficial for our customers and our business. So it's definitely something that we're hyper focused on. Scot, I might just add one other thought, which is the momentum that's behind the KDG and the Motion combination. We get very active and positive feedback from customers on kind of the breadth and depth of the service offering, the value-add services. And I think that's really extended the leadership position of the combined business over the last 12 months. Yes, Bret, let me take a pass at that. We're in the very early innings Obviously, the last 12 to 18 months has delivered really strong momentum. We're excited about that. We fully expect to continue to do that. We're in, call it, 10 to 15 categories. We've got opportunities to do more than that. Within the categories that we actually offer that doesn't necessarily mean they're in each one of our local markets. So even if we just stayed in our 10 to 15 primary categories, we'd have a great opportunity to continue to push that product. But we're excited about this and believe that it can be close to 20% of the revenue over the next 2 to 3 years. It's a great question. The short answer is, it's always the above on the store base. So a lot of thought has gone into the markets in which we want to add relative density. And so depending on the best way to do that, we'll consider either working with an independent owner or if it's another competitive store group, we'll consider that. But as you alluded to, it's strategic markets, adding that density, making sure that we've got the ability to cover customers well with the right inventory mix, and it's a very attractive ROIC lever for us as we bring a lot of value to those merged entities after we own. It's a national approach. We're doing it. It's the same M&A strategy, quite frankly, globally for our automotive business. We do the same work in Canada, and we did the same work in Europe as we do here in the U.S. It has the potential to be. It will take some time just given the law of numbers, but that is a lever that we have to change that mix, for sure. Yes. The synergies are in both buckets. So we have net sales synergies as well as cost synergies. So they interplay together. We do think there's some upside as we move forward. The business has really nice momentum. We committed to $50 million when we originally announced the transaction by year three. We're in a position to deliver $50 million by the end of year two. So with $30 million realized through year 1, an incremental $20 million in year 2. And I'm confident that the team will execute well and deliver on that commitment and potentially more. Yes, Seth, I would -- its Will. I would say that weather might have helped slightly, but not material to close the year. As we look forward, it's currently 80 degrees here in Atlanta. There's a couple of feet of snow in different parts of the country. It's hard to predict. I would tell you, January feels like -- certainly, in our North American market, it's been a mild winter that had some implications for some of our product categories, but I'm confident the team is going to work through that. We can't control it. So we're going to focus on what we can control and make sure that we're taking care of our customers and our teammates safely."

            "content": "Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams and our outstanding performance, and I'm pleased to share the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results. My comments this morning focused primarily on quarterly and full year adjusted results, which exclude nonrecurring items that I'll cover in more detail shortly.  Total GPC sales were up 15% or $720 million to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects an 11.1% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and an 8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was essentially in line with our assumption for the quarter.  Sales for the full year were $22.1 billion, up 17.1% from 2021. As we continue to invest in organic and acquisitive growth initiatives for both of our segments, it was encouraging to see our core business combined with acquisitions, including KDG, which added more than $1 billion in revenues for 2022 drive strong sales throughout the year.  Our gross margin expanded approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 35.7%, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives that Will mentioned. These initiatives, along with others, contributed approximately 160 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by a few key factors: first, moderating year-over-year supplier incentives pressured gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; second, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial business impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points; finally, foreign currency and inflation impacted gross margin by approximately 50 basis points.  With a strong fourth quarter, gross margin for the full year was 35.1%, slightly above our expectations and essentially in line with the prior year. Our performance on gross margin reflects an excellent job by our team, executing our strategies given the very dynamic market challenges. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the fourth quarter, excluding adjustments, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 16.6% from 2021 and a 28.7% of sales compared to 28.3% of sales in the prior year. Our expenses were up in the quarter, primarily due to inflation-driven increases in freight costs and overall investments in IT initiatives across our business units.  For the year, total expenses were $6.2 billion, up 16.2% at a 27.9% of sales, a 20 basis point improvement from 2021. Despite ongoing cost pressures in the fourth quarter, we continue to drive leverage on strong core sales growth across our businesses and execute on our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies.  Segment profit in the fourth quarter was $526 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 9.5%, an impressive 80 basis point increase from the same period in 2021. For the full year, segment profit was $2.1 billion, up 25% on a 17% sales increase. Our segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year and up 160 basis points from 2019, which we believe demonstrates our transformation to an even stronger company and our ability to consistently perform through dynamic economic conditions.  As outlined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter results include three adjustments. The first item relates to a $29 million adjustment to remeasure our product liability reserve. Secondly, we incurred approximately $13 million of costs related to the acquisition and integration of KDG. The third item relates to an $11 million loss on the divestiture of our remaining minority interest investment in S.P. Richards, which was finalized in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, our non-recurring items include these fourth quarter adjustments as well as the 12-month impact of costs related to KDG and a gain on the sale of certain real estate recorded in the second quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share in nonrecurring items I just discussed, was $292 million or $2.05 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $256 million or $1.79 per diluted share in 2021, an increase of 15%.  For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $8.34 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from 2021. Reported net income was $1.2 billion or $8.31 per diluted share. The continued execution of our initiatives allowed us to deliver back-to-back double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2022 and 2021. With strong earnings growth and improved working capital, we generated $222 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year, a 17% increase from 2021. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up 14% from 2021, and we closed the fourth quarter and year with $2.2 billion in available liquidity.  Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. Our strong performance has allowed us to stay focused on four key priorities for capital allocation, including the reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  For the year, we invested $340 million in capital expenditures, including $96 million in the fourth quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We also invested $3 billion investment in KDG and returned $719 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $496 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $223 million in cash used to repurchase 1.6 million shares. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $8.95, which represents an increase of 6% to 7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022. Our outlook for earnings growth is driven by our expectations for continuous sales growth and another year of margin expansion.  We expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. As we look at the business segments, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% increase in comparable sales. We would add that our outlook for Industrial assumes a much stronger first half relative to the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Turning to a few other items of interest. We will continue to drive growth through the reinvestment in our business and M&A. We currently expect CapEx to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million in 2023, reflecting incremental opportunities in technology and supply chain, among others. We also continue to have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and we'll continue to seek additional bolt-on acquisitions wherever they create value for us.  In 2023, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Earlier this week, our Board approved a $3.80 per share annual dividend for 2023, representing our 67th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 6% increase from the $3.58 per share paid in 2022 and is above our 20-year average increase of 5.8%.  Our total shareholder return performance of approximately 27% in 2022 placed GPC in the top 10% of the S&P 500. Taken together, we delivered sales growth of 17% and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, so a tremendous year in 2022. Our teams worked hard for these achievements, and we enter 2023 with strong momentum and are well positioned to continue to take share and deliver through an uncertain macro environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move through the year. In closing, as both Paul and Will have mentioned, we look forward to hosting our Investor Day on March 23. We are excited to provide further insights on key growth initiatives, and long-term financial targets and are confident you will find the day informative and productive. We'd love to see you here in Atlanta. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Thanks, Chris. It's Bert. I'll take that one. I think in terms of the cadence of the year and maybe I'll just pull it up a level and talk about the guidance in general, sure you can appreciate the forecasting environment has its challenges right now, particularly with the mixed macro signals. We're very comfortable with our outlook, 4% to 6% top line, driving EPS up 6% to 7%, and in our range of $8.80 to $8.95. And we do expect margin expansion. That will come from both segments.  We see industrial having a little bit more upside on margin expansion in the auto business, but we'll see nice improvement on both. When we looked at our guidance and talking about the cadence, we really try to be as thoughtful as we can in this environment. We've got solid industry fundamentals for both businesses. We have really good momentum in both businesses coming out of 2022, but we've had two exceptional years. And I think we're in an environment where we all expect, not only GPC, but others growth to moderate a bit and normalize. And I think that's still good, and I think what we're doing this year and what we're forecasting for 2023 is a good outcome.  There are headwinds, and we're staying very prudent with our eyes wide open on the key factors that are out there to watch. We can't ignore that there's recessionary pressure and inflation in the geopolitical landscape around the world are all things we're watching. As we look at the year, we really kind of broke it into two halves. The automotive grows consistently across the quarters. So I think the cadence will stay pretty nice across the year and a few halves are 4 to 6 in both halves.  On the industrial, we're a little stronger in the first half, more high single-digit outlook for the first half for industrial and on the second half, more low single digit. And that's really just some of the uncertainty on that side of the business with some decelerating PMI numbers and things like that. So that's what we can see right now, a little stronger view into the first half and a little less clarity on the second half. And we think that lines up nicely for the full year. Again, KDG has been accretive to the business for the full year. I think you saw in our release and our commentary that we had a nice synergy benefit from KDG, and we'll continue to get good synergy benefits as we look into 2023. So we like that acquisition. It's been a tremendous expansion of capability for the Motion business, and our team at Motion has done an absolutely brilliant job of integrating and executing that acquisition.  So all that taken together, I think we feel really good about where we are. We're very bullish on GPC, and our size, scale and momentum across both segments position us to be successful. And we're going to watch the landscape and continue to stay ready for what comes at us as the macro environment continues to move. Yes. So on the margin side, we're going to carry the momentum that we had in the fourth quarter. Our teams are doing absolutely reliant job of executing our core strategies on pricing and sourcing capabilities. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about a 160 basis point increase in the fourth quarter just from the execution of category management, pricing and sourcing activities, that's going to continue. We expect that to continue into 2023, and so that success is what we have in our forecast.  We're looking for gross margins to be up in the range of 20 to 40 basis points for 2023. We don't really see a lot of headwind there. Anything in terms of what we're looking at from FX or inflation or any of that, it's pretty negligible at this point. So we're bullish on our execution of our gross margin activities and that helps us expand margin overall.  The SG&A impact on those two investment side are offset by other efficiencies. So when you look at the full year, we expect deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points in total. I gave you 60 basis points of deleverage, and so you'll see that we're making some ground up in driving leverage outside of those two investment categories where we can be more efficient and smarter in the business. Yes, Seth, this is Bert. That's right. We're thinking about that total automotive segment out of 4% to 6%. And within that, we would be in the same range for the U.S. business."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid. And good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report the GPC team capped off a record setting year with a strong fourth quarter highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth coupled with continued margin expansion.  We're incredibly proud of the progress in our operations and thankful to our teammates across the globe for their ongoing commitment to excellence.  With the support of strong industry fundamentals and resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses, our teams were focused on executing key initiatives to drive sales growth faster than the market, improved gross margin and enhance operational efficiencies. As a result, we delivered in several key areas in the fourth quarter and full year.  A few highlights in the fourth quarter would include total sales of $5.5 billion up 15%. And our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth. Segment margin of 9.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 up 15% from 2021 and our 10th consecutive quarter of double digit earnings growth.  For the full year, our strong quarterly performance drove record total sales of $22.1 billion up 17% which follows a 14% increase in 2021. Segment margin of 9.4% up 60 basis points from 2021. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.34 up 21% from the prior year, and a new GPC record. And strong cash flow with cash from operations up 17% and free cash flow up 14% from 2021 levels.  Reflecting on the record year which followed and outstanding 2021, we are confident that our transformation efforts, including the streamlining of our businesses to an automotive and industrial centric business, along with our ongoing strategic initiatives has been highly successful. Throughout 2022, our teams have navigated the dynamics of the macro economy and have continued to deliver market share gains while delivering positive momentum across our core businesses.  We continue to make significant investments in talent and technology to maximize the impact of our key initiatives. As examples, we made solid progress to advance our pricing strategies and optimize our supply chain and network footprint. Our execution in the field has proven effective in driving poor improvement in gross margin and SG&A as well as parts availability, all of which provide additional opportunities for us in the future.  As we build on the competitive advantages of our size and scale, we continue to look for strategic M&A opportunities to further boost our product and service offerings and expand our automotive and industrial footprint. As you will hear from Will, last year's acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, has been transformational for our industrial segment. KDG had a significant impact on our industrial performance in 2022. And as elevated our capabilities as a premier industrial solutions provider. Our global automotive teams were also active with acquisitions, including geographic expansion in Europe, with the addition of operations in both Spain and Portugal. For the year, we added 138 net new stores across our global footprint, with the U.S. and Europe leading the way. Looking ahead, we have a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets, and M&A remains an important element of our global growth strategy. As we turn our attention to 2023. While the macro environment remains uncertain, we are confident in our strategic plans to drive ongoing market share gains, with sustained sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow. Looking at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive business is benefiting from several tailwinds, including the geographic diversity of our markets. The increase in vehicle miles driven an aging vehicle fleet and limited new car inventory. These tailwinds are driving steady levels of demand in the aftermarket, with particular strength in the DIFM segment. In industrial, we continue to see solid demand trends with new and existing customer activity and reshoring threat trends, each presenting growth opportunities. We believe this strong performance in our industrial business reflects the diversity of our product and service offerings, as well as our end markets, which all performed well in the fourth quarter. In addition, as you'll hear from Will, our growing capabilities and industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and convenience, are proving to be differentiators for our business. Collectively, we believe these strong fundamentals, combined with a rock solid balance sheet, position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities through both organic and inquisitive investment, while also returning capital to shareholders. So before I close, I'd like to remind our investor community that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor day on Thursday, March 23, here at our headquarters in Atlanta. We will be sharing more about our strategic initiatives and provide an update to our long-term financial targets. We look forward to hosting this event next month and hope to see you all here in Atlanta. We have an exceptional 2022, which included celebrating our 95th year of operations. Our accomplishments as one GPC team are evident in this milestone year. And we are proud to lead a company with such a long and rich history that differentiates GPC across all of our marketplaces. But now I'll turn the call over to Will. Yes. And Chris, I would just add. I think as you look at our more traditional end markets, food products, iron and steel, aggregate, automotive, all up well into the double digits in Q4. So as both Will and Bert had said, we remain incredibly bullish about our industrial business. I'm pleased to say, we're seeing double-digit growth right out of the blocks here in Q1. So yes, we're going to -- we're just going to keep on pressing forward. And look, there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the future. You've got manufacturing returning to the U.S., a lot of onshoring, reshoring. You've got a lot of investments in semiconductors, energy, battery storage, mining, all of which play to our strength. Yes. So inflation, just to kind of talk about it trend-wise, our view is that it moderated in the fourth quarter. It ticked down slightly from Q3, and that monetary policy in the U.S. is working. It's having an effect around the world, but it does take some time all about the flow through supply chain and through the businesses. So as you said, Q4 and FY '22 inflation levels overall were mid-single digits. High single digits in auto and low single digits in industrial.  And as we look to '23, we expect for it to continue to moderate for the full year. We think monetary policy works and will work. We were at a peak of 9.1% in June. We had 7 straight months of easing. And when we look at that, the way we kind of thought about our forecast for the full year is that the full year would be at a low single-digit all up, remaining at low single digits for industrial and low single digit for auto.  That obviously ticks down across the course of the year. So we step down Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 as monetary policy continues to have an impact. Again, it's a little bit of a wildcard, and we have to make an assumption when we give our guide, which is what we've done. So we'll still be watching the effect of monetary policy and other actions, but that's our assumption based. Q1, just to be specific, we'll tick down from where we are to mid-single digit, I think, for auto. Industrial stays at low single digit and all up mid-single digits in Q1. And Scot, I would just add to that, that we're -- despite what you may be hearing in the marketplace, the pricing environment overall as it generally has been in automotive is rational, we're not seeing any huge swings one way or the other. And as you well know, having the product on the shelf and available when the customer needs it is still the primary driver and not necessarily price. I don't think so, Scot. I know you and I talked about it on the last call. Look, we're not totally insulated from the effects of a downturn in PMI or industrial production. But I would tell you, we are a whole lot more confident today given the diversity of our product and our service offering, the end markets we're servicing, things like EV manufacturing plant.  I mentioned earlier, the opportunity with onshore, nearshore and manufacturing coming back to the U.S. So all of that bodes very well for Motion. And we've evolved, I guess, Scot -- my time here, we've evolved from being a -- basically a distributor of bearings and industrial supplies to a really world-class industrial solutions provider, one who provides solutions in automation, robotics, conveyance, hydraulics, fluid power. So look, we're not totally immune to what's happening in manufacturing, but I like our business, I like our team and I like our chances. And again, we're off to another really good start here in Q1. Liz, you're exactly right. We're being a little conservative here. We're holding some dry powder. Look, we are at 1.7 times, well below our stated range of 2 to 2.5 times. And we like that position. We think that it's really smart right now in this environment. We'll look for opportunistic things across the board whether it's CapEx or M&A. And so we really do think that we've been able to work that down post KDG acquisition right after we bought KDG earlier in the year, we were closer to 2.  So I think nice performance to work it back down. And look across the landscape or whatever we might see come up. So nothing pressing or imminent, but we just like the financial flexibility that we have with our current cash balance, our total liquidity and being very disciplined across our capital allocation structure. Bret, I know we got into this discussion last time we were together. And so I would tell you, I think we're at about the bottom of the third, Bret, in terms of our process here in private label. It's going extremely well. All the countries have jumped on board, and we haven't even rolled it out yet to the new markets we entered last year, Spain and Portugal. So yes, we're excited, and I know the team is excited. And the best part is, our customers and the consumers are buying the product, and they love the product. Yes. So thanks for the question, Joe. And look, it's a reality, and there's a number of reports that we've all reviewed of late commenting on the number of CEOs that are considering and have begun considering bringing manufacturing back here, not only the U.S., but across North America. And certainly, Mexico would be a part of that where we have a strong presence with the Motion business.  So look, it's a positive. It's more long -- it's certainly more long range. It's not going to -- certainly not going to happen overnight. But again, I think as these companies do return to North America, automation is going to play a significant role given some of the labor challenges and labor shortages. So automation in these operations is going to be significant, and again, we are extremely well positioned as it relates to our automation and robotics offerings. Well, I would tackle that, Seth. We're hoping to see a little bit of a lift, which we did see in the latter part of the year as fuel prices started to abate a bit here in the U.S. So I still think there's a bit of a reluctance for mass transit, not to mention air travel and air fares are at all-time high. So I think that a 1% lift would not be out of the realm of possibility. So we think it will be a tailwind in '23, for sure. Yes. Thanks, Chad. We appreciate it. Appreciate all the questions and everyone joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're incredibly pleased with the reported record year for GPC, and we could not be prouder of the great work done by all of our teammates around the world. We continue to be excited with the momentum this business continues to generate, and I would just conclude by saying, the future is very, very bright for GPC. So I hope you all have a great day wherever you are, and hope to see you at our Investor Day meeting here in March. All the best."

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Now I will turn it over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Before diving into the details of the quarter, we want to say that our hearts go out to our teammates, suppliers, customers and all those affected by the devastating impact of Hurricane Ian in late September. GPC is committed to providing care and support through our GPC Relief Fund and our partners at the American Red Cross. So now turning to the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our results for 2022 and we are proud of the great work by all of our 53,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. Our team delivered record results with double-digit sales and earnings growth driven by the execution of effective strategies and continued resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses. Let\u2019s review several of our Q3 highlights. Total sales of $5.7 billion, up 18% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.23, up 19% from last year. Record quarterly sales for the automotive and industrial segments and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall, record quarterly earnings and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. The ongoing integration of KDG, which continues to create significant value. And finally, continued strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. Our teams are executing on key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive ongoing momentum in our top and bottom line results. We remain agile in navigating a dynamic operating environment created by inflation and economic conditions, the geopolitical landscape and supply chain challenges. We continue to benefit from the competitive advantages of our size and scale and we remain focused on advancing our technology to optimize inventory availability, enhance network productivity and maximize the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. We are making significant progress in our operations through our efforts in all these areas as evident in the expansion of operating margins again in the third quarter. Our automotive and industrial businesses continue to take advantage of several industry tailwinds. In automotive, the increase in year-to-date miles driven and aging car park, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are all supportive of healthy demand in the aftermarket. In industrial, the manufacture and economy remains expansionary with PMI holding at greater than 50%, while industrial production just had its ninth straight quarter of growth, up 2.9% year-over-year. Our teams continue to operate well in a challenging environment. And as we wind down the year, we remain focused on driving our strategic initiatives across all of our global operations. This past quarter, we spent considerable time in the field visiting stores and branches, meeting with many of our strategic suppliers and customers and we came away encouraged by the general outlook for continued growth in the automotive aftermarket and industrial space. In addition, during the quarter, our global leadership team met to review our near-term initiatives and collaborate on our long-term strategic roadmap. Our teams are well aligned and we are confident in our strategic plans to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth and margin expansion. Our strong cash flow generation and exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments in both organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So before I pass the call over to Will, we would like to highlight our 2022 Sustainability Report, which we published earlier this month. The new report advances GPC\u2019s long-term sustainability strategy and expands our reporting and disclosure to reflect the extent of our global operations. We do this through a focus on three key areas, including improving diversity, equity and inclusion, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing ESG governance. Two highlights from the report include: the completion of our 2022 employee engagement survey, where we had significant participation across our global teams and received an 80% global engagement score. And secondly, the calculation and disclosure of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and plans for greenhouse gas reduction programs across our global operations. We believe that our 2022 sustainability report illustrates GPC\u2019s strong ESG strategy and a way forward that underscores our commitment to keeping the world moving. We encourage you to visit the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress in this important area. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering on another great quarter of record results. So now, I will turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the collective focus and hard work to deliver great results around the world. During the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by solid team execution and disciplined focus on strategic initiatives, which are aligned around our five foundational priorities, talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology. Turning to the performance by segment, total sales for Global Automotive were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $285 million or 8.9% versus the same period last year. Our sales performance was relatively consistent in all 3 months of the quarter, and on a comparable basis, sales growth for the quarter increased 9.2%. Our global teams delivered mid single-digit to mid-teens comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and strong team execution. Global Automotive segment profit was $309 million, and segment operating margin was 8.9%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the same period last year. This performance reflects strong sales growth and operating expense leverage. During the third quarter, our automotive business experienced high single-digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second quarter. The pricing environment remains rational, and we\u2019re pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our strategic category management initiatives. We expect sales inflation in the fourth quarter to be largely consistent with the third quarter. Now let\u2019s turn to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with brakes, filters, fluids and batteries all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth within the majority of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low to mid-single-digit growth. Our commercial business saw broad-based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with high single-digit sales growth during the third quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience. U.S. automotive initiatives are advancing well with continued progress in talent, technology investments, customer segmentation, analytics, pricing capabilities and emerging tech. During the quarter, the U.S. Automotive team formally realigned team resources to establish a centralized project management office to coordinate and drive the impact of its business initiative portfolio. As an example of emerging tech efforts, the U.S. Automotive team hosted its first ever EV Day in Atlanta, which included teammates and representatives from various strategic emerging tech partners. We use this opportunity to update internal teammates and collaborate with our electric vehicle and emerging technology suppliers. In addition, as another example of our emerging tech focus, Motion recently established a new electric vehicle battery customer segment based on increasing opportunities presented by the build-out of new battery manufacturing facilities across North America. We continue to build momentum with our EV efforts as we leverage our global footprint business mix and scale to extend our emerging tech leadership position. In Canada, sales grew approximately 15% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales growth of 13%. The strong results in Canada are reflective of solid industry fundamentals, team execution and market share gains. As examples of sales effectiveness and data and technology initiatives, Canada continues to improve the customer experience and simplify its business processes with advanced analytics and business intelligence tools. This micro market visibility has increased wallet share and identified growth opportunities as the team executes both organic and inorganic growth initiatives. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales increasing approximately 20% in local currency and comparable sales up 7%. Growth in Europe is a result of the continued focus on its strategic initiatives, including growth with key customer accounts, the rollout of the NAPA brand across the region and investments in our people, technology and supply chain capabilities. In addition, our bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and add to our local market coverage. Our recent acquisitions in Germany, Spain and Portugal are tracking well with integration plans and the performance and synergy capture has exceeded our internal expectations. Overall, we believe our European strategies have resulted in solid market share gains. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 16% in local currency from last year with comparable sales growth of 14%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division, all delivering strong profitable growth. Next month, our Australian and New Zealand team will celebrate Repco\u2019s 100-year anniversary, which is a testament to the power of the brand, differentiated customer value proposition and Repco\u2019s position as the leading automotive aftermarket business in the market. Congratulations to our teammates down under on achieving this incredible milestone. Turning to the Global Industrial segment, during the third quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $570 million or 35.3%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 20% versus last year. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. The growth was consistent across almost all product categories and major industries serve with particular strength coming from industries such as food, chemicals, aggregate and cement, mining and oil and gas. Industrial segment profit was $243 million or 11.1% of sales representing an 80 basis point increase from the same period last year and a new record for the Industrial segment. The improvement is a result of Motion\u2019s strong sales growth and disciplined operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the third quarter, inflation in the industrial segment held in the low single-digit range, consistent with the levels we have seen throughout the year. Key initiatives contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business include sales programs to capture organic profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data-driven strategic pricing and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omnichannel experience and continued ongoing inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives. As an example of footprint optimization efforts, Motion successfully executed its initial fulfillment center and branch optimization initiative in Florida, which is designed to improve the customer experience by offering next-day delivery for an order placed by 3:00 p.m. In addition to an improved customer experience, the strategy reduces duplicative inventory position, increases available product breadth and increases the efficiency and reduces the cost of our last mile delivery logistics. In addition, Motion opened two new strategically located facilities to grow its value-added automation services with existing and new customers. We are pleased with the initiative results and Motion will continue to methodically roll out these strategies nationwide over time. In addition, the integration of KDG continues to exceed our expectations. The teams are executing well-defined plans with customers, suppliers and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined organization. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan, including the colocation and merging of overlapping branches and we are excited for the continued growth opportunities at Motion. Lastly, during the quarter, we were pleased to formally open the GPC Global Technology Center based in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. As part of our strategic investments in talent and technology, the center is designed to help accelerate our technology initiatives and capability building. The technology center will serve as an integrated extension of our existing global team and will focus on areas such as digital, supply chain, data platforms, pricing and cybersecurity as a few examples. With nearly 1 million people living in Cracow and approximately 200,000 students, Krak\u00f3w is a global hub for next-generation tech balance. As we move forward, we\u2019ll consider technology roles in Krak\u00f3w to leverage our scale build capabilities and deliver faster path to value for global technology initiatives. As we execute our organic growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create value. During the third quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in key geographies. The M&A pipeline continues to be active and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our strong third quarter and year-to-date results are being driven by supportive industry fundamentals and our key strategic initiatives. While the macro environment remains dynamic, our teams will prioritize our customers as we analyze our market and performance indicators remain agile and strategically invest with discipline and initiatives that extend our global leadership position. With that, I will turn the call over to Bert Nappier.\nBert Nappier: Thank you Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. As I review the key highlights for the third quarter, our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which excludes the non-recurring costs related to the integration of KDG. Total GPC sales were $5.7 billion in the third quarter, up $856 million or 17.8% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects a 12.7% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation, and a 9.1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, in line with our assumptions. Hurricane Ian did not have a material impact on our third quarter financial results. Our gross margin was 34.9%, a 60 basis point decrease compared to the third quarter last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by three key factors: first, moderating supplier incentives, which pressured gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Second, foreign currency, which impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. And finally, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial segment, which impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by the positive impact of our data-driven pricing and sourcing programs where our teams continue to leverage our growing global scale. These actions and our expertise drove an 85 basis point favorable impact to gross margin in the third quarter. We currently expect our full year gross margin to be in line with our third quarter and 9-month rate. Our total operating and non-operating expenses excluding non-recurring items, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 15% from 2021 and at 27.5% of sales compared to 28% of sales the prior year. We continue to drive leverage across our businesses, and our teams remain focused on effective cost controls and executing our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies. With our strong performance, segment profit was $552 million, up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.7%, a 40 basis point increase from last year and up 170 basis points from 2019. We believe the multiyear improvement in our segment margin is the result of transformation to a stronger and more agile company. Our teams have taken actions to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio of automotive and industrial segments. We have also enhanced our pricing and sourcing capabilities to ensure that we deliver profitable growth. In addition, we\u2019ve generated significant cost savings over the last few years to lower our cost structure. Collectively, these actions, along with continued hard work by our teams, set the foundation for long-term strategic growth. Our third quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $4.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share and non-recurring KDG integration costs was $317 million, or $2.23 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $270 million or $1.88 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 19%. This exceptional performance is a result of the crisp execution of our initiatives, which are translating to GPC, delivering accelerated growth and profitability. As we turn to the balance sheet, changes in the key elements of our working capital were generally in line with our sales growth. At September 30, our total accounts receivable were up 17%, with inventory up 15%. Likewise, accounts payable increased 15% from 2021, which also correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flow with $454 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and $1.2 billion for the 9 months, up 23% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x. This compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. The key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these include reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $244 million in capital expenditures, including $91 million in the third quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $542 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $369 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $173 million in cash to repurchase 1.3 million shares. The continued strength of our cash flow provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles and has allowed GPC to increase our dividend for 66 consecutive years. Turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance and raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.05 to $8.15, which represents an increase of 16% to 18% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.80 to $7.95. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase from 12% to 14%. By business segment, we\u2019re guiding to the following: 7% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an update from 6% to 8%. This new outlook also reflects 7% to 8% comparable sales growth. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales growth outlook to 31% to 32%, an increase from our previous outlook of 26% to 28%. The new outlook includes a 15% to 16% comparable sales increase, which is up from 9% to 11%. We are pleased with the positive momentum in our business in the third quarter and through the 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the continued confidence in our execution balanced against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain macro environment. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us with full flexibility to support our growth plans through ongoing investments in the business and return of cash to our shareholders while remaining balanced and disciplined. We look forward to reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our next call in February. Thank you, and we will now turn it back over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. Congrats, guys. Some good numbers. I guess my first question is on the gross margin performance. Could you just give us a little more insight as to by segment in both the quarter given that you\u2019ve got increase in costs, you said it\u2019s passing through price remains rational, but it is starting to fall. So just if you could sort of walk us through each segment as to what\u2019s driving that.\nBert Nappier: Sure, Greg. It\u2019s Bert. Thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start just with the reiteration, we were down 60 basis points to 34.9 on a consolidated basis. The quarter benefited from an 85 basis point improvement in the underlying execution of our day-to-day strategic pricing and sourcing programs. That really reflects the outstanding execution from the team across the environment. I don\u2019t really want to break it down into each segment. I mean we\u2019re all performing well on the underlying core of the business. We\u2019re pleased with the actions on both segments. And the teams are really doing an exceptional job, as you can imagine, in a very, very dynamic environment. That\u2019s hard to see, unfortunately, here in the quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had three key factors. I\u2019ll reiterate those year-over-year moderation in supplier incentives, that\u2019s 80 bps; currency, which you\u2019re aware at the end of the quarter there we had a lot of movement in currency rates, 30 basis points. And then the industrial performance and the acquisition of KDG, a 35 basis point drag there. That\u2019s a lower gross margin business relative to automotive. But at the same time, we trade that off for a higher margin business. And as you heard Will mentioned in his prepared remarks, an 11.1% margin for industrial for the quarter, which is a record. Just a little more color on the supplier rebates. Those moderated from a year ago when heightened supply chain challenges. We\u2019re constraining things as we\u2019re all aware. The positive is that we now have more inventory. We have a more available base of inventory for our customers, which is a good thing. Another reminder, a year ago, that was a 116 basis point benefit to margin from that issue. So look, as I mentioned, for the full year, we think the gross margin rate for the full year will be in line with the third quarter. But despite all that, we see expansion of margin here in the fourth quarter \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, here in the third quarter by 40 basis points to 9.7% margin. That\u2019s the third consecutive quarter of overall margin expansion, and we expect that for the fourth quarter as well. When you look at the fourth quarter looking ahead, I think as you look at that number and guiding to the Q3 levels, we really see the two variables there from where we prior \u2013 from our prior guidance being gross margin performance at Motion continuing to outperform our earlier expectations and currency.\nGreg Melich: Got it. I guess my follow-up would be on that fourth quarter. If I sort of back into it, it seems like there is a pretty meaningful deceleration in organic growth with the new guidance. I think it\u2019s maybe 500 or 600 bps in auto and maybe double that in industrial. Is there \u2013 is that actually happening in October? Or is that just conservatism?\nBert Nappier: Let me take that kind of up one level and give you some color on guidance overall. First, I want to thank our teams. We\u2019ve had a great third quarter, first 9 months. I think the business continues to be very balanced and resilient, but like everyone, forecasting in this environment has its challenges. We took a number of factors into account in our guidance raise. Firstly, our performance year-to-date and the industry fundamentals and momentum we see. But obviously, we have to balance that against the macro including, we think, with inflation and pressuring cost. We can\u2019t ignore any of these tightening conditions and undoubtedly, those will impact businesses and consumers at some point. The macro data has been pretty choppy, as you\u2019re aware, but we\u2019re very comfortable and confident in our overall guide with the new guidance range of $8.05 to $8.15. That\u2019s going to have EPS up year-over-year, 16% to 18% on the back of a really, really strong year a year ago. We\u2019re being prudent, I think it\u2019s probably the right way to phrase it. Eyes wide open on things to watch. We\u2019ve got inflation, geopolitical tension, supply chain constraints, effect, fuel and energy prices, all moving around on us. But at the same time, there is probably, Greg, a little modesty here. We outperformed in the fourth quarter a year ago, and we\u2019ve outperformed so far this year, and we\u2019re not necessarily a management team that will continue to count on the same level of outperformance. When I look at the fourth quarter, I\u2019d kind of call your attention to a few things for the fourth quarter guide and the full year. We\u2019ve got incremental foreign currency, as I mentioned, $0.03 headwind in the fourth quarter relative to when we gave you guidance before. The gross margin rate compression that we just discussed and also, we have 1 fewer working day in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s something to be aware of. But look, my dad used to say be baseball ready and that needs to be ready for whatever comes. I think we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to look for additional growth opportunities and efficiency and discipline. And I\u2019m going to let Will give you a little bit more color on the segment side on the sales.\nWill Stengel: Yes, Greg, maybe just to answer your question, I mean, we\u2019re encouraged by the trends that we\u2019re seeing through October across the global business. So if that\u2019s any indicator, we\u2019re not seeing a slowdown. We\u2019re proud of the teams for continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter. Just maybe some other thoughts. As you think about kind of what\u2019s implied in the Q4, I\u2019d just remind you, Q4 \u201821 for auto had a big comp, high teens. So the guide for auto on a 2 year is kind of close to that 20%. And that holds true for U.S. auto and kind of each of the pieces of global automotive. So still really solid performance. And as I said, encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing through October.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s helpful and good luck.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Greg.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers. Please go ahead with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe to follow-up on that a little bit. One of your industrial distributor peers talked about some, I guess, softer tone in certain customer segments when they reported recently. As you were out in the field recently, is there \u2013 are you sensing any of that caution? And do you think it\u2019s maybe just like the tack that you\u2019re taking, like eventually something could happen and we\u2019re being cautious or do you think there is something \u2013 some real change going on in some of your businesses on the industrial side?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, Chris, thanks. This is Paul. I would tell you, and we have spent a good bit of time in the field late. I traveled with the Motion team I don\u2019t know, a few weeks back. And we spent a good bit of time with that group this week. The overall sentiment from our Motion team, Chris, remains really strong, optimistic. They are seeing increases across just about every customer segment in every product segment. So I\u2019m aware of the other industrial group, you mentioned that reported earlier this week. But I have to tell you, we\u2019re not seeing it on our side, Chris. And I would just remind you, we\u2019re still seeing expansion in PMI, which we generally track pretty closely with through the years anyway. And industrial production came out earlier this week in industrial production, again, post a good result in September. So I would tell you, overall, our Motion team continues to perform at an incredibly high level. And as Will said, early numbers in October point to that continuing well into Q4.\nWill Stengel: Chris, maybe just some other perspective to add to Paul\u2019s comments, sales cadence was consistent for the industrial team through the quarter, as Paul said, the vast majority, if not all the product categories were growing north of 20% plus, which were high single digits 2 plus 20%. All of our end markets, we\u2019re seeing super strong growth. We track 15 different industries. All are performing very well. We called out a few in the script, equipment machinery, food products, iron steel, automotive, mining, oil and gas. And I\u2019d tell you, geographically, we\u2019re seeing strength pretty broad-based, including Canada and Mexico as well as our service business, fluid power automation conveyance. So are the customers just like everybody trying to predict what happens in 2023, certainly, those discussions happen when we were out in the field. But the backlogs are strong, and the recent trends have been strong. So we feel bullish about certainly closing the year and then coming into next year with some momentum.\nChristopher Horvers: Thank you for that. Will, I think at a recent conference, you mentioned the ability to take segment margins to the double-digit range. Can you talk a little bit more about that \u2013 do you see that \u2013 is that more of a blended of NAPA and Motion or could you see that potential for the NAPA segment to also reach double digit and what do you think the big drivers are to get there?\nBert Nappier: Hi, Chris, it\u2019s Bert. I\u2019ll take that one. Look, I think as the new CFO coming in and taking a look at this business, I\u2019m sitting here looking around and we\u2019re asking ourselves questions about what\u2019s the full potential of the two businesses together. So I know you would appreciate that exercise as the new guy. We\u2019re not ready to give you a target on that. I want to do some homework here over the next several months as we sharpen our pencil around that. But we\u2019re doing that work. I think the historical perspective here has been this business can be a 7% and then an 8% and then we\u2019re marching our way up the chain there. You\u2019ve seen a margin at 9.7% this quarter consolidated which is another improvement in the third consecutive one \u2013 this third consecutive quarter in a row of improvement there. As I look ahead with a fresh set of eyes coming in, I see a tremendous amount of opportunity for things that are within our own control, not necessarily reliant on external. Some of those are underway. Some of those would be sourcing and category management initiatives, which are in early innings, pricing initiatives, which are in early innings. The business demonstrated a great ability through the pandemic to transform continue to be more efficient and lower cost structure, that\u2019s going to continue. And I think there is a tailwind there. We have got two really great businesses with great size and scale. And when you have that kind of power behind you, I think you do have an ability to continue to grow and improve margins. We will have some modernization of our supply chain and DCs that continue. Will talked about that a little bit in his prepared remarks around the Florida facility for Motion. So, there are just a tremendous amount of opportunities. And we owe you to come back and give you some full longer term targets there, but hopefully, that gives you a little perspective as the new CFO.\nChristopher Horvers: That\u2019s great. Thanks Bert.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Donahue: Chris, you are coming back for another one? I think we just had, Chris.\nChristopher Horvers: I can ask more questions. I got a lot more.\nPaul Donahue: I will talk to you later Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. You had mentioned, I think in your automotive comments that you saw growth in all categories, and we just wanted to confirm that if it includes discretionary categories and what you are seeing relative to the more defensive categories? And then just with regards to transaction versus ticket if you saw any meaningful change this quarter versus last quarter in automotive?\nWill Stengel: Thanks Kate. Thanks for the question. Let me take a pass at that and Bert and Paul will jump in. Maybe just starting at the top, for U.S. auto, consistent growth through the quarter, we have recognized and celebrated a variety of different sales records through the quarter, so super proud of the teams for that. As we mentioned, both DIFM and do-it-yourself, we are strong and positive through the quarter, which is always good to see. If you look at the subsets of the business, the mid-single digit performance from our major accounts in our AutoCare, we had low-double digit to low teens in our fleet and government business. And we had, as we said, mid-single digit retail performance on tough comp. No change in trends from ticket and transactions. We talked about that, I think last quarter, transactions down, ticket up, but that was as we expected, our categories of strength, batteries, filters, brakes, commodities and chemicals. And then we saw really broad-based strength across the geographies, with particular outperformance in our mountain region, which is Texas through Montana and Alaska for our business and then down the eastern part of the United States, including the Northeast Atlantic region and Southeast. So, we saw some strength in our accessories category, which is the retail category for us, a smaller piece of the business, but I think that\u2019s somewhat discretionary in nature, and we saw a nice strength there. So, really strong broad-based performance through the quarter around the business on the U.S. auto side.\nPaul Donahue: And Kate, I would just add to Will\u2019s comments that a driver of that business is certainly fuel prices. We are seeing fuel prices coming down a bit, which is always a good thing for our auto business. We certainly expect to see miles driven ticking back. People are taking to the roads. And they are a little \u2013 still a little bit reticent to get on mass transit and airplanes. So, all those factors, I believe will continue to bode well for our auto business going into next year.\nKate McShane: Thank you. And if I could just ask one follow-up question, I think you mentioned you expect the same inflation, same-SKU inflation in Q4 as what you saw in Q3. And I know you are not talking about 2023 today, but do you have any high-level views about when you could expect to see some moderating of the inflation and how that might impact traffic versus \u2013 or transaction versus ticket next year?\nBert Nappier: Hi Kate, it\u2019s Bert. I will take that one. Look, I mean I will kind of point this out, and I will reiterate it. Our expectation, let\u2019s talk about the fourth quarter because that\u2019s a bit of a setup for 2023. Our expectation at this point for inflation for Q4 is that it stays consistent with the Q3 level. And I think in our view that means it\u2019s stabilizing on some level to moderating. However, as many of you know, the inflow of moderating or stabilizing levels of inflation takes some time to flow through supply chain. I think that will lag into 2023. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of monetary policy action afoot, and that will take some time to have an effect into 2023, but we would anticipate that it would. As we turn the corner into the next year, I think we will see continued pressure on labor costs and on product costs at this point. Again, I mean we are looking several months ahead here. So, that\u2019s a little bit of our initial view. When we think about it from our perspective, it\u2019s a tough and dynamic environment, and our teams are really focused on this and it requires intense focus. Our strategy remains unchanged in that regard as we look ahead. We are going to continue to pass along inflation impacts to protect our gross margin rate. I think we have done a nice job of managing that in a very dynamic environment, and we are going to continue to focus on those category management and pricing actions. So hopefully, that gives you a little color. We are talking about something several months away, but that\u2019s our initial view on that front.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Thanks Kate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nBret Jordan: Hey. Good morning guys.\nPaul Donahue: Good morning.\nBret Jordan: On the European automotive, could you talk a bit more about the private label strategy there? What you are seeing as far as consumer acceptance of the NAPA brand and maybe what percentage is in the mix now and how the margin delta sets up versus the legacy product that you were selling?\nPaul Donahue: So, Bret, I will take a stab at this one, and let the other guys jump in. I was with our European team all last week over in Spain and pleased to report that the NAPA brand rollout continues to expand across Europe, not only in the new markets, we will be launching in Spain and Portugal later this year, early next year, but also expanding the number of product categories that we are currently positioning under the NAPA brand. The acceptance, I have to tell you, Bret, has been beyond expectation. All that said, it\u2019s still about 10%, give or take, of our total business. So, it\u2019s meaningful. But look, we are still \u2013 we still have a long way to go, and before NAPA becomes a real dominant piece of our overall business over there. So, very pleased with where we find ourselves. And look, there is a lot of discussion around Europe, a lot of concern around Europe. But I can tell you, Bret, you saw the numbers, you heard Will talk about the numbers in Q3, another really, really strong quarter, up 20% plus local currency. And pleased to tell you that despite all the noise through the first couple of weeks of October, business in fourth quarter looks good as well. So, we continue to be very bullish about our European business.\nBret Jordan: You just answered my second question, but just \u2013 to go back to the first half of the first \u2013 on the October trend in Europe. But how does the margin shake up in Europe on the private label mix, obviously, a different supply chain?\nWill Stengel: Yes. Bret, it\u2019s neutral. Generally speaking, on average it\u2019s neutral. So, either a good guy or a bad guy. And I would just add to Paul\u2019s comments, I figured you asked a follow-up. But as he said, we are continuing to see really good strength broadly in each one of our countries, Germany, mid-teens growth, Benelux, low-double digits, mid single-digit growth in the UK and the French market. So, as Paul said, NAPA is a big part of each one of those country strategies and initiatives and they have got nice traction delivering super nice results. So, good to see.\nBret Jordan: If it\u2019s margin neutral is the long-term goal to get a better cost of goods there to get margin out of it. I mean what\u2019s the point of the initiative, if it\u2019s not more profitable?\nWill Stengel: That\u2019s the strategy over time, obviously, getting the brand into the market, putting it into the line logic and penetrating the market as kind of step one and then over time as it develops the following, we will revisit that.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Bret.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you. Just a question on the automotive side. And Paul, you had mentioned that new vehicle supply and elevated used car prices have been tailwinds, but you started to see used car pricing rolling over and new vehicle supply could begin to improve. So, I mean how much of a headwind do you think that could be as you plan your business for the next few years?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. I appreciate you pointing that out, Liz. We are seeing used car prices coming down a bit. I honestly don\u2019t see that being a huge impact on our business overall. We look at \u2013 look, the key drivers for our business have always been and will continue to be, I believe the average age of the vehicle on the road, which is at a new record again in this year over 12 years. Miles driven is always going to be a key element for us. And we are seeing an uptick in miles driven as fuel prices moderate just a bit. And I think you are going to see that as folks do begin to return to the workplace and are again, a bit hesitant to get on mass transit. I think we will continue to see that drive forward. So, look, in terms of new car sales, Liz, it\u2019s a little bit of a double-edged sword. We need those new car sales because 5 years from now, those are going to be our customers as they come to the aftermarket. So, if new car sales tick up a bit, that\u2019s not going to have a big impact on our business in the short-term. In the long-term, it\u2019s a good thing for us. And if we go back to the 17 million vehicle new car vehicles produced each year sold each year, that\u2019s not a bad thing for us at all because that\u2019s our future customers. So, I think any way you slice it, the \u2013 our business \u2013 our U.S. automotive business and our global automotive business is in a good place and the fundamentals are very sound.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Yes, that makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on the auto side. Will had mentioned you are pleased with the market share growth in the majority of categories, what are the categories where you aren\u2019t pleased with your market share? And what do you view as the biggest opportunities?\nWill Stengel: Look, I am looking down our list, but I am not sure I can call out one where we are not pleased. I mean we are seeing really broad-based strength across all the product categories. So, I can\u2019t call out one where we are disappointed. Obviously, if there are some inventory opportunities, those would be \u2013 that will be the commentary where we would want to do better, but I am not sure that\u2019s a function of the demand drivers or kind of our strategy. So, sorry for not being more helpful, but I think that\u2019s the honest truth.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. Alright. Thanks very much.\nPaul Donahue: Okay. Thanks. Thanks Liz.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys.\nPaul Donahue: Good morning Scot.\nScot Ciccarelli: How are doing? So, the industrial business is obviously very strong. And we know that historically, it\u2019s followed some of the broader macro factors and index changes typically with about a six-month to nine-month lag or so. And Paul, I think you already pointed out how PMI is still positive, but obviously, it\u2019s moderated quite a bit. So, I guess the question is, how should we kind of net out today\u2019s strong growth versus at least what appears to be a pretty significant moderation in that, let\u2019s call it, broader macro trend?\nPaul Donahue: So Scot, thanks for the question. And you are right to point out that the moderation in PMI. But again, anything over 50, if we are growing and we continue to grow. That said, the motion footprint Scot, is different today than we were historically. So, we have expanded our footprint into segments like conveyance, conveyors and all things around that product category, which as we have seen the distribution center model, expand across the U.S. We have seen great expansion in that product category, automation and robotics is a growing double digit \u2013 strong-double digit category for us, and we believe we have huge upside in that area. So, if you look at the motion of today, Scot, it\u2019s different than it was 3 years to 5 years ago when we were primarily a power transmission and industrial supplies-type business. And that has been intentional from our team. And I think will shelter us going forward and will give us a leg up as we go forward if we do see continued softening because Scot, you are not alone. We continue to have people and analysts and investors question the industrial business and do we believe that we will continue to see the great growth that we have seen out of that business in the last couple of years. And certainly, while we have shown 20% comp growth in Q3, we are not going to stay at 20%. We are realistic enough to know that, but we also do believe that that\u2019s a business that we can continue to grow 6% to 8% year-after-year-after-year regardless of what PMI and industrial production numbers might call out.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please go ahead.\nCarolina Jolly: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nPaul Donahue: No problem. Good morning.\nCarolina Jolly: Good morning. So, just a quick question around cash flow, working capital. Your AP to inventory ratio is probably around 130% now. That\u2019s definitely higher compared to 2019. Has that been a structural shift since you extended terms in Europe, or do you think we will see that kind of revert to your historic\u2026?\nBert Nappier: No, I don\u2019t think it has anything necessarily to do with Europe. When you look at the landscape \u2013 this is Bert, by the way, I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the European landscape. Look, the business has changed fundamentally over the last year. We have a large acquisition of KDG in the Motion business. But when we look at our working capital metrics, we are very pleased with where we are. We have had a six-day reduction in our cash conversion cycle during the course of the year. So, we are pleased with that. Managing payables well. DSO is down, managing inventory very well as well. And so I don\u2019t think there is anything that I would call out as a structural shift. It\u2019s something that we stay very focused on a day-to-day basis, given the unlock of cash as we are smarter about how we do that. Look, as we look ahead, I mean nobody is perfect. We do have opportunities to optimize on the inventory side, and we will continue to do that. And we have got great teams here that are focused on that as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t place any overreliance or over-indexing on any one factor. Bottom line is we have had very strong cash flow through the course of the year. We will have a great result for the rest of the year in terms of free cash flow and for the full year. And that takes us back to our long-standing ability to continue to be very disciplined and thoughtful on capital allocation and reinvest in the business, which we will continue to do because we see great opportunities there. And at the same time, return capital back to shareholders, which as you all know, we have a long-standing history of doing so.\nCarolina Jolly: Great. Thanks. So, it doesn\u2019t sound like this is a temporary benefit you are seeing right now, but it\u2019s corporate initiatives that have been working.\nBert Nappier: No. I wouldn\u2019t point to a temporary benefit. I think we are very consistently \u2013 I know some of this predates me, but consistently showing improvement across cash conversion and our working capital elements.\nCarolina Jolly: Great. Thanks. And then just a quick second one. Your DIY business seems to have been doing very well performing potentially just given what have been said in the second quarter call. Can you talk about why you think that is? Is it the digital factor that you talked about in the beginning of the call or just any commentary there?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Carolina, it\u2019s Will. I think you nailed it. We are super proud. We have made a lot of progress on all things, technology and digital for our retail business all around the globe, but in particular, U.S. automotive and in Canada and investments in the catalog, investments in search, investments in kind of product data quality have been making a real difference. So, more work to do, but proud of the progress the teams are making.\nCarolina Jolly: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks Dave. Just to all of our folks out there today, we appreciate your questions and everyone joining the call. Look, we are very pleased with another record quarter at Genuine Parts Company. We could not be more proud of the great work done by all of our GPC teammates around the world. We continue to be excited that with the momentum that our business is generating. And I would just conclude by saying the future continues to be very, very bright for Genuine Parts Company. So, you all have a great day, and we look forward to chatting again in February. Thank you.\nOperator: The call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I also would like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the collective focus and hard work to deliver great results around the world. During the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by solid team execution and disciplined focus on strategic initiatives, which are aligned around our five foundational priorities, talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology. Turning to the performance by segment, total sales for Global Automotive were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $285 million or 8.9% versus the same period last year. Our sales performance was relatively consistent in all 3 months of the quarter, and on a comparable basis, sales growth for the quarter increased 9.2%. Our global teams delivered mid single-digit to mid-teens comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and strong team execution. Global Automotive segment profit was $309 million, and segment operating margin was 8.9%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the same period last year. This performance reflects strong sales growth and operating expense leverage. During the third quarter, our automotive business experienced high single-digit levels of inflation, relatively consistent with the levels we saw in the second quarter. The pricing environment remains rational, and we're pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our strategic category management initiatives. We expect sales inflation in the fourth quarter to be largely consistent with the third quarter. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 8%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with brakes, filters, fluids and batteries all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth within the majority of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which had low to mid-single-digit growth. Our commercial business saw broad-based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with high single-digit sales growth during the third quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience. U.S. automotive initiatives are advancing well with continued progress in talent, technology investments, customer segmentation, analytics, pricing capabilities and emerging tech. During the quarter, the U.S. Automotive team formally realigned team resources to establish a centralized project management office to coordinate and drive the impact of its business initiative portfolio. As an example of emerging tech efforts, the U.S. Automotive team hosted its first ever EV Day in Atlanta, which included teammates and representatives from various strategic emerging tech partners. We use this opportunity to update internal teammates and collaborate with our electric vehicle and emerging technology suppliers. In addition, as another example of our emerging tech focus, Motion recently established a new electric vehicle battery customer segment based on increasing opportunities presented by the build-out of new battery manufacturing facilities across North America. We continue to build momentum with our EV efforts as we leverage our global footprint business mix and scale to extend our emerging tech leadership position. In Canada, sales grew approximately 15% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales growth of 13%. The strong results in Canada are reflective of solid industry fundamentals, team execution and market share gains. As examples of sales effectiveness and data and technology initiatives, Canada continues to improve the customer experience and simplify its business processes with advanced analytics and business intelligence tools. This micro market visibility has increased wallet share and identified growth opportunities as the team executes both organic and inorganic growth initiatives. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales increasing approximately 20% in local currency and comparable sales up 7%. Growth in Europe is a result of the continued focus on its strategic initiatives, including growth with key customer accounts, the rollout of the NAPA brand across the region and investments in our people, technology and supply chain capabilities. In addition, our bolt-on acquisition efforts continue to create value and add to our local market coverage. Our recent acquisitions in Germany, Spain and Portugal are tracking well with integration plans and the performance and synergy capture has exceeded our internal expectations. Overall, we believe our European strategies have resulted in solid market share gains. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 16% in local currency from last year with comparable sales growth of 14%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco, NAPA and our motorcycle accessories division, all delivering strong profitable growth. Next month, our Australian and New Zealand team will celebrate Repco's 100-year anniversary, which is a testament to the power of the brand, differentiated customer value proposition and Repco's position as the leading automotive aftermarket business in the market. Congratulations to our teammates down under on achieving this incredible milestone. Turning to the Global Industrial segment, during the third quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $570 million or 35.3%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG, increased approximately 20% versus last year. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. The growth was consistent across almost all product categories and major industries serve with particular strength coming from industries such as food, chemicals, aggregate and cement, mining and oil and gas. Industrial segment profit was $243 million or 11.1% of sales representing an 80 basis point increase from the same period last year and a new record for the Industrial segment. The improvement is a result of Motion's strong sales growth and disciplined operating performance, including the KDG synergy realization. For the third quarter, inflation in the industrial segment held in the low single-digit range, consistent with the levels we have seen throughout the year. Key initiatives contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business include sales programs to capture organic profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data-driven strategic pricing and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omnichannel experience and continued ongoing inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives. As an example of footprint optimization efforts, Motion successfully executed its initial fulfillment center and branch optimization initiative in Florida, which is designed to improve the customer experience by offering next-day delivery for an order placed by 3:00 p.m. In addition to an improved customer experience, the strategy reduces duplicative inventory position, increases available product breadth and increases the efficiency and reduces the cost of our last mile delivery logistics. In addition, Motion opened two new strategically located facilities to grow its value-added automation services with existing and new customers. We are pleased with the initiative results and Motion will continue to methodically roll out these strategies nationwide over time. In addition, the integration of KDG continues to exceed our expectations. The teams are executing well-defined plans with customers, suppliers and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined organization. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan, including the colocation and merging of overlapping branches and we are excited for the continued growth opportunities at Motion. Lastly, during the quarter, we were pleased to formally open the GPC Global Technology Center based in Krako\u0301w, Poland. As part of our strategic investments in talent and technology, the center is designed to help accelerate our technology initiatives and capability building. The technology center will serve as an integrated extension of our existing global team and will focus on areas such as digital, supply chain, data platforms, pricing and cybersecurity as a few examples. With nearly 1 million people living in Cracow and approximately 200,000 students, Krako\u0301w is a global hub for next-generation tech balance. As we move forward, we'll consider technology roles in Krako\u0301w to leverage our scale build capabilities and deliver faster path to value for global technology initiatives. As we execute our organic growth initiatives, we continue to complement them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create value. During the third quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in key geographies. The M&A pipeline continues to be active and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth and create long-term value. In summary, our strong third quarter and year-to-date results are being driven by supportive industry fundamentals and our key strategic initiatives. While the macro environment remains dynamic, our teams will prioritize our customers as we analyze our market and performance indicators remain agile and strategically invest with discipline and initiatives that extend our global leadership position. With that, I will turn the call over to Bert Nappier. Yes, Greg, maybe just to answer your question, I mean, we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing through October across the global business. So if that's any indicator, we're not seeing a slowdown. We're proud of the teams for continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter. Just maybe some other thoughts. As you think about kind of what's implied in the Q4, I'd just remind you, Q4 \u201821 for auto had a big comp, high teens. So the guide for auto on a 2 year is kind of close to that 20%. And that holds true for U.S. auto and kind of each of the pieces of global automotive. So still really solid performance. And as I said, encouraged by what we're seeing through October. Thank you, Greg. Chris, maybe just some other perspective to add to Paul's comments, sales cadence was consistent for the industrial team through the quarter, as Paul said, the vast majority, if not all the product categories were growing north of 20% plus, which were high single digits 2 plus 20%. All of our end markets, we're seeing super strong growth. We track 15 different industries. All are performing very well. We called out a few in the script, equipment machinery, food products, iron steel, automotive, mining, oil and gas. And I'd tell you, geographically, we're seeing strength pretty broad-based, including Canada and Mexico as well as our service business, fluid power automation conveyance. So are the customers just like everybody trying to predict what happens in 2023, certainly, those discussions happen when we were out in the field. But the backlogs are strong, and the recent trends have been strong. So we feel bullish about certainly closing the year and then coming into next year with some momentum. Thanks Kate. Thanks for the question. Let me take a pass at that and Bert and Paul will jump in. Maybe just starting at the top, for U.S. auto, consistent growth through the quarter, we have recognized and celebrated a variety of different sales records through the quarter, so super proud of the teams for that. As we mentioned, both DIFM and do-it-yourself, we are strong and positive through the quarter, which is always good to see. If you look at the subsets of the business, the mid-single digit performance from our major accounts in our AutoCare, we had low-double digit to low teens in our fleet and government business. And we had, as we said, mid-single digit retail performance on tough comp. No change in trends from ticket and transactions. We talked about that, I think last quarter, transactions down, ticket up, but that was as we expected, our categories of strength, batteries, filters, brakes, commodities and chemicals. And then we saw really broad-based strength across the geographies, with particular outperformance in our mountain region, which is Texas through Montana and Alaska for our business and then down the eastern part of the United States, including the Northeast Atlantic region and Southeast. So, we saw some strength in our accessories category, which is the retail category for us, a smaller piece of the business, but I think that's somewhat discretionary in nature, and we saw a nice strength there. So, really strong broad-based performance through the quarter around the business on the U.S. auto side. Yes. Bret, it's neutral. Generally speaking, on average it's neutral. So, either a good guy or a bad guy. And I would just add to Paul's comments, I figured you asked a follow-up. But as he said, we are continuing to see really good strength broadly in each one of our countries, Germany, mid-teens growth, Benelux, low-double digits, mid single-digit growth in the UK and the French market. So, as Paul said, NAPA is a big part of each one of those country strategies and initiatives and they have got nice traction delivering super nice results. So, good to see. That's the strategy over time, obviously, getting the brand into the market, putting it into the line logic and penetrating the market as kind of step one and then over time as it develops the following, we will revisit that. Look, I am looking down our list, but I am not sure I can call out one where we are not pleased. I mean we are seeing really broad-based strength across all the product categories. So, I can't call out one where we are disappointed. Obviously, if there are some inventory opportunities, those would be \u2013 that will be the commentary where we would want to do better, but I am not sure that's a function of the demand drivers or kind of our strategy. So, sorry for not being more helpful, but I think that's the honest truth. Yes, Carolina, it's Will. I think you nailed it. We are super proud. We have made a lot of progress on all things, technology and digital for our retail business all around the globe, but in particular, U.S. automotive and in Canada and investments in the catalog, investments in search, investments in kind of product data quality have been making a real difference. So, more work to do, but proud of the progress the teams are making."

            "content": "Thank you Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. As I review the key highlights for the third quarter, our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which excludes the non-recurring costs related to the integration of KDG. Total GPC sales were $5.7 billion in the third quarter, up $856 million or 17.8% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects a 12.7% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation, and a 9.1% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact of foreign currency, in line with our assumptions. Hurricane Ian did not have a material impact on our third quarter financial results. Our gross margin was 34.9%, a 60 basis point decrease compared to the third quarter last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted by three key factors: first, moderating supplier incentives, which pressured gross margin by approximately 80 basis points. Second, foreign currency, which impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. And finally, a shift in the mix of our sales based on the strength of our industrial segment, which impacted gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by the positive impact of our data-driven pricing and sourcing programs where our teams continue to leverage our growing global scale. These actions and our expertise drove an 85 basis point favorable impact to gross margin in the third quarter. We currently expect our full year gross margin to be in line with our third quarter and 9-month rate. Our total operating and non-operating expenses excluding non-recurring items, were approximately $1.6 billion, up 15% from 2021 and at 27.5% of sales compared to 28% of sales the prior year. We continue to drive leverage across our businesses, and our teams remain focused on effective cost controls and executing our initiatives to produce operational efficiencies. With our strong performance, segment profit was $552 million, up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.7%, a 40 basis point increase from last year and up 170 basis points from 2019. We believe the multiyear improvement in our segment margin is the result of transformation to a stronger and more agile company. Our teams have taken actions to streamline our operations and optimize our portfolio of automotive and industrial segments. We have also enhanced our pricing and sourcing capabilities to ensure that we deliver profitable growth. In addition, we've generated significant cost savings over the last few years to lower our cost structure. Collectively, these actions, along with continued hard work by our teams, set the foundation for long-term strategic growth. Our third quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $4.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share and non-recurring KDG integration costs was $317 million, or $2.23 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $270 million or $1.88 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 19%. This exceptional performance is a result of the crisp execution of our initiatives, which are translating to GPC, delivering accelerated growth and profitability. As we turn to the balance sheet, changes in the key elements of our working capital were generally in line with our sales growth. At September 30, our total accounts receivable were up 17%, with inventory up 15%. Likewise, accounts payable increased 15% from 2021, which also correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flow with $454 million in cash from operations in the third quarter and $1.2 billion for the 9 months, up 23% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7x. This compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. The key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these include reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $244 million in capital expenditures, including $91 million in the third quarter, primarily in technology and other projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity. We have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $542 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $369 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $173 million in cash to repurchase 1.3 million shares. The continued strength of our cash flow provides us the ability to manage our capital allocation through all business cycles and has allowed GPC to increase our dividend for 66 consecutive years. Turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance and raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.05 to $8.15, which represents an increase of 16% to 18% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.80 to $7.95. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in the range of 15% to 16%, an increase from 12% to 14%. By business segment, we're guiding to the following: 7% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an update from 6% to 8%. This new outlook also reflects 7% to 8% comparable sales growth. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales growth outlook to 31% to 32%, an increase from our previous outlook of 26% to 28%. The new outlook includes a 15% to 16% comparable sales increase, which is up from 9% to 11%. We are pleased with the positive momentum in our business in the third quarter and through the 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the continued confidence in our execution balanced against the backdrop of a dynamic and uncertain macro environment. Our continued strong cash flow generation provides us with full flexibility to support our growth plans through ongoing investments in the business and return of cash to our shareholders while remaining balanced and disciplined. We look forward to reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our next call in February. Thank you, and we will now turn it back over to the operator for your questions. Sure, Greg. It's Bert. Thanks for joining. Thanks for the question. I'll start just with the reiteration, we were down 60 basis points to 34.9 on a consolidated basis. The quarter benefited from an 85 basis point improvement in the underlying execution of our day-to-day strategic pricing and sourcing programs. That really reflects the outstanding execution from the team across the environment. I don't really want to break it down into each segment. I mean we're all performing well on the underlying core of the business. We're pleased with the actions on both segments. And the teams are really doing an exceptional job, as you can imagine, in a very, very dynamic environment. That's hard to see, unfortunately, here in the quarter. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had three key factors. I'll reiterate those year-over-year moderation in supplier incentives, that's 80 bps; currency, which you're aware at the end of the quarter there we had a lot of movement in currency rates, 30 basis points. And then the industrial performance and the acquisition of KDG, a 35 basis point drag there. That's a lower gross margin business relative to automotive. But at the same time, we trade that off for a higher margin business. And as you heard Will mentioned in his prepared remarks, an 11.1% margin for industrial for the quarter, which is a record. Just a little more color on the supplier rebates. Those moderated from a year ago when heightened supply chain challenges. We're constraining things as we're all aware. The positive is that we now have more inventory. We have a more available base of inventory for our customers, which is a good thing. Another reminder, a year ago, that was a 116 basis point benefit to margin from that issue. So look, as I mentioned, for the full year, we think the gross margin rate for the full year will be in line with the third quarter. But despite all that, we see expansion of margin here in the fourth quarter \u2013 or I'm sorry, here in the third quarter by 40 basis points to 9.7% margin. That's the third consecutive quarter of overall margin expansion, and we expect that for the fourth quarter as well. When you look at the fourth quarter looking ahead, I think as you look at that number and guiding to the Q3 levels, we really see the two variables there from where we prior \u2013 from our prior guidance being gross margin performance at Motion continuing to outperform our earlier expectations and currency. Let me take that kind of up one level and give you some color on guidance overall. First, I want to thank our teams. We've had a great third quarter, first 9 months. I think the business continues to be very balanced and resilient, but like everyone, forecasting in this environment has its challenges. We took a number of factors into account in our guidance raise. Firstly, our performance year-to-date and the industry fundamentals and momentum we see. But obviously, we have to balance that against the macro including, we think, with inflation and pressuring cost. We can't ignore any of these tightening conditions and undoubtedly, those will impact businesses and consumers at some point. The macro data has been pretty choppy, as you're aware, but we're very comfortable and confident in our overall guide with the new guidance range of $8.05 to $8.15. That's going to have EPS up year-over-year, 16% to 18% on the back of a really, really strong year a year ago. We're being prudent, I think it's probably the right way to phrase it. Eyes wide open on things to watch. We've got inflation, geopolitical tension, supply chain constraints, effect, fuel and energy prices, all moving around on us. But at the same time, there is probably, Greg, a little modesty here. We outperformed in the fourth quarter a year ago, and we've outperformed so far this year, and we're not necessarily a management team that will continue to count on the same level of outperformance. When I look at the fourth quarter, I'd kind of call your attention to a few things for the fourth quarter guide and the full year. We've got incremental foreign currency, as I mentioned, $0.03 headwind in the fourth quarter relative to when we gave you guidance before. The gross margin rate compression that we just discussed and also, we have 1 fewer working day in the fourth quarter. So that's something to be aware of. But look, my dad used to say be baseball ready and that needs to be ready for whatever comes. I think we're doing that. We're going to look for additional growth opportunities and efficiency and discipline. And I'm going to let Will give you a little bit more color on the segment side on the sales. Hi, Chris, it's Bert. I'll take that one. Look, I think as the new CFO coming in and taking a look at this business, I'm sitting here looking around and we're asking ourselves questions about what's the full potential of the two businesses together. So I know you would appreciate that exercise as the new guy. We're not ready to give you a target on that. I want to do some homework here over the next several months as we sharpen our pencil around that. But we're doing that work. I think the historical perspective here has been this business can be a 7% and then an 8% and then we're marching our way up the chain there. You've seen a margin at 9.7% this quarter consolidated which is another improvement in the third consecutive one \u2013 this third consecutive quarter in a row of improvement there. As I look ahead with a fresh set of eyes coming in, I see a tremendous amount of opportunity for things that are within our own control, not necessarily reliant on external. Some of those are underway. Some of those would be sourcing and category management initiatives, which are in early innings, pricing initiatives, which are in early innings. The business demonstrated a great ability through the pandemic to transform continue to be more efficient and lower cost structure, that's going to continue. And I think there is a tailwind there. We have got two really great businesses with great size and scale. And when you have that kind of power behind you, I think you do have an ability to continue to grow and improve margins. We will have some modernization of our supply chain and DCs that continue. Will talked about that a little bit in his prepared remarks around the Florida facility for Motion. So, there are just a tremendous amount of opportunities. And we owe you to come back and give you some full longer term targets there, but hopefully, that gives you a little perspective as the new CFO. Hi Kate, it's Bert. I will take that one. Look, I mean I will kind of point this out, and I will reiterate it. Our expectation, let's talk about the fourth quarter because that's a bit of a setup for 2023. Our expectation at this point for inflation for Q4 is that it stays consistent with the Q3 level. And I think in our view that means it's stabilizing on some level to moderating. However, as many of you know, the inflow of moderating or stabilizing levels of inflation takes some time to flow through supply chain. I think that will lag into 2023. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of monetary policy action afoot, and that will take some time to have an effect into 2023, but we would anticipate that it would. As we turn the corner into the next year, I think we will see continued pressure on labor costs and on product costs at this point. Again, I mean we are looking several months ahead here. So, that's a little bit of our initial view. When we think about it from our perspective, it's a tough and dynamic environment, and our teams are really focused on this and it requires intense focus. Our strategy remains unchanged in that regard as we look ahead. We are going to continue to pass along inflation impacts to protect our gross margin rate. I think we have done a nice job of managing that in a very dynamic environment, and we are going to continue to focus on those category management and pricing actions. So hopefully, that gives you a little color. We are talking about something several months away, but that's our initial view on that front. Thanks Kate. No, I don't think it has anything necessarily to do with Europe. When you look at the landscape \u2013 this is Bert, by the way, I don't think it has anything to do with the European landscape. Look, the business has changed fundamentally over the last year. We have a large acquisition of KDG in the Motion business. But when we look at our working capital metrics, we are very pleased with where we are. We have had a six-day reduction in our cash conversion cycle during the course of the year. So, we are pleased with that. Managing payables well. DSO is down, managing inventory very well as well. And so I don't think there is anything that I would call out as a structural shift. It's something that we stay very focused on a day-to-day basis, given the unlock of cash as we are smarter about how we do that. Look, as we look ahead, I mean nobody is perfect. We do have opportunities to optimize on the inventory side, and we will continue to do that. And we have got great teams here that are focused on that as well. So, I wouldn't place any overreliance or over-indexing on any one factor. Bottom line is we have had very strong cash flow through the course of the year. We will have a great result for the rest of the year in terms of free cash flow and for the full year. And that takes us back to our long-standing ability to continue to be very disciplined and thoughtful on capital allocation and reinvest in the business, which we will continue to do because we see great opportunities there. And at the same time, return capital back to shareholders, which as you all know, we have a long-standing history of doing so. No. I wouldn't point to a temporary benefit. I think we are very consistently \u2013 I know some of this predates me, but consistently showing improvement across cash conversion and our working capital elements."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Before diving into the details of the quarter, we want to say that our hearts go out to our teammates, suppliers, customers and all those affected by the devastating impact of Hurricane Ian in late September. GPC is committed to providing care and support through our GPC Relief Fund and our partners at the American Red Cross. So now turning to the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our results for 2022 and we are proud of the great work by all of our 53,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. Our team delivered record results with double-digit sales and earnings growth driven by the execution of effective strategies and continued resilience of our automotive and industrial businesses. Let's review several of our Q3 highlights. Total sales of $5.7 billion, up 18% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.23, up 19% from last year. Record quarterly sales for the automotive and industrial segments and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall, record quarterly earnings and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. The ongoing integration of KDG, which continues to create significant value. And finally, continued strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. Our teams are executing on key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive ongoing momentum in our top and bottom line results. We remain agile in navigating a dynamic operating environment created by inflation and economic conditions, the geopolitical landscape and supply chain challenges. We continue to benefit from the competitive advantages of our size and scale and we remain focused on advancing our technology to optimize inventory availability, enhance network productivity and maximize the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. We are making significant progress in our operations through our efforts in all these areas as evident in the expansion of operating margins again in the third quarter. Our automotive and industrial businesses continue to take advantage of several industry tailwinds. In automotive, the increase in year-to-date miles driven and aging car park, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are all supportive of healthy demand in the aftermarket. In industrial, the manufacture and economy remains expansionary with PMI holding at greater than 50%, while industrial production just had its ninth straight quarter of growth, up 2.9% year-over-year. Our teams continue to operate well in a challenging environment. And as we wind down the year, we remain focused on driving our strategic initiatives across all of our global operations. This past quarter, we spent considerable time in the field visiting stores and branches, meeting with many of our strategic suppliers and customers and we came away encouraged by the general outlook for continued growth in the automotive aftermarket and industrial space. In addition, during the quarter, our global leadership team met to review our near-term initiatives and collaborate on our long-term strategic roadmap. Our teams are well aligned and we are confident in our strategic plans to deliver long-term sales and earnings growth and margin expansion. Our strong cash flow generation and exceptional balance sheet position GPC with the financial strength and flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities via investments in both organic and acquisitive growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So before I pass the call over to Will, we would like to highlight our 2022 Sustainability Report, which we published earlier this month. The new report advances GPC's long-term sustainability strategy and expands our reporting and disclosure to reflect the extent of our global operations. We do this through a focus on three key areas, including improving diversity, equity and inclusion, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing ESG governance. Two highlights from the report include: the completion of our 2022 employee engagement survey, where we had significant participation across our global teams and received an 80% global engagement score. And secondly, the calculation and disclosure of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and plans for greenhouse gas reduction programs across our global operations. We believe that our 2022 sustainability report illustrates GPC's strong ESG strategy and a way forward that underscores our commitment to keeping the world moving. We encourage you to visit the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress in this important area. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering on another great quarter of record results. So now, I will turn the call over to Will. Thank you, Greg. Yes, Chris, thanks. This is Paul. I would tell you, and we have spent a good bit of time in the field late. I traveled with the Motion team I don't know, a few weeks back. And we spent a good bit of time with that group this week. The overall sentiment from our Motion team, Chris, remains really strong, optimistic. They are seeing increases across just about every customer segment in every product segment. So I'm aware of the other industrial group, you mentioned that reported earlier this week. But I have to tell you, we're not seeing it on our side, Chris. And I would just remind you, we're still seeing expansion in PMI, which we generally track pretty closely with through the years anyway. And industrial production came out earlier this week in industrial production, again, post a good result in September. So I would tell you, overall, our Motion team continues to perform at an incredibly high level. And as Will said, early numbers in October point to that continuing well into Q4. Chris, you are coming back for another one? I think we just had, Chris. I will talk to you later Chris. And Kate, I would just add to Will's comments that a driver of that business is certainly fuel prices. We are seeing fuel prices coming down a bit, which is always a good thing for our auto business. We certainly expect to see miles driven ticking back. People are taking to the roads. And they are a little \u2013 still a little bit reticent to get on mass transit and airplanes. So, all those factors, I believe will continue to bode well for our auto business going into next year. Good morning. So, Bret, I will take a stab at this one, and let the other guys jump in. I was with our European team all last week over in Spain and pleased to report that the NAPA brand rollout continues to expand across Europe, not only in the new markets, we will be launching in Spain and Portugal later this year, early next year, but also expanding the number of product categories that we are currently positioning under the NAPA brand. The acceptance, I have to tell you, Bret, has been beyond expectation. All that said, it's still about 10%, give or take, of our total business. So, it's meaningful. But look, we are still \u2013 we still have a long way to go, and before NAPA becomes a real dominant piece of our overall business over there. So, very pleased with where we find ourselves. And look, there is a lot of discussion around Europe, a lot of concern around Europe. But I can tell you, Bret, you saw the numbers, you heard Will talk about the numbers in Q3, another really, really strong quarter, up 20% plus local currency. And pleased to tell you that despite all the noise through the first couple of weeks of October, business in fourth quarter looks good as well. So, we continue to be very bullish about our European business. Thank you, Bret. Yes. I appreciate you pointing that out, Liz. We are seeing used car prices coming down a bit. I honestly don't see that being a huge impact on our business overall. We look at \u2013 look, the key drivers for our business have always been and will continue to be, I believe the average age of the vehicle on the road, which is at a new record again in this year over 12 years. Miles driven is always going to be a key element for us. And we are seeing an uptick in miles driven as fuel prices moderate just a bit. And I think you are going to see that as folks do begin to return to the workplace and are again, a bit hesitant to get on mass transit. I think we will continue to see that drive forward. So, look, in terms of new car sales, Liz, it's a little bit of a double-edged sword. We need those new car sales because 5 years from now, those are going to be our customers as they come to the aftermarket. So, if new car sales tick up a bit, that's not going to have a big impact on our business in the short-term. In the long-term, it's a good thing for us. And if we go back to the 17 million vehicle new car vehicles produced each year sold each year, that's not a bad thing for us at all because that's our future customers. So, I think any way you slice it, the \u2013 our business \u2013 our U.S. automotive business and our global automotive business is in a good place and the fundamentals are very sound. Okay. Thanks. Thanks Liz. Good morning Scot. So Scot, thanks for the question. And you are right to point out that the moderation in PMI. But again, anything over 50, if we are growing and we continue to grow. That said, the motion footprint Scot, is different today than we were historically. So, we have expanded our footprint into segments like conveyance, conveyors and all things around that product category, which as we have seen the distribution center model, expand across the U.S. We have seen great expansion in that product category, automation and robotics is a growing double digit \u2013 strong-double digit category for us, and we believe we have huge upside in that area. So, if you look at the motion of today, Scot, it's different than it was 3 years to 5 years ago when we were primarily a power transmission and industrial supplies-type business. And that has been intentional from our team. And I think will shelter us going forward and will give us a leg up as we go forward if we do see continued softening because Scot, you are not alone. We continue to have people and analysts and investors question the industrial business and do we believe that we will continue to see the great growth that we have seen out of that business in the last couple of years. And certainly, while we have shown 20% comp growth in Q3, we are not going to stay at 20%. We are realistic enough to know that, but we also do believe that that's a business that we can continue to grow 6% to 8% year-after-year-after-year regardless of what PMI and industrial production numbers might call out. Thank you. No problem. Good morning."

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the presentation and instructions will be given at that time. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSid Jones: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; and Bert Nappier, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the Genuine Parts Company Investor Relations' website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today\u2019s discussion of our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, I'm here with Will as well as Bert, who was on his first earnings call as CFO. Welcome to the call Bert. We are pleased to report continued strong results from Genuine Parts Company in the second quarter of 2022. The GPC team had another record quarter consisting of double-digit sales and earnings increases and a steady cadence of continued growth throughout April, May and June. Total sales were $5.6 billion, up 17%, and adjusted earnings per share were $2.20, up 26% from last year. We continue to benefit from the resiliency of our automotive and industrial businesses and the strategic mix of our operations. We would like to thank our 53,000 talented GPC teammates for their exceptional work and commitment to excellence. A few highlights in the quarter include another quarterly sales record for GPC and our automotive and industrial segment, segment operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall, record quarterly earnings and double-digit EPS growth for the eighth consecutive quarter and strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. We continue to execute our key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive positive momentum in our top and bottom line results despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Our teams are doing an excellent job of navigating supply chain disruptions, enabling our business with the product we need to serve our customers and capture market share. For example, we are investing in our businesses to enhance forecast accuracy for product demand, improve fill rates and optimize our network footprint. Our size and global scale continue to be an advantage as we work to have the right part in the right place at the right time. Likewise, our pricing strategies have proven valuable in substantially offsetting product inflation and rising freight cost. Our M&A strategy has also been effective. As you will hear from Will, the accelerated integration of KDG has been executed with a high degree of precision and has had a meaningful impact on our industrial performance. In addition, our global automotive teams have been active with ongoing strategic bolt-on acquisitions, such as the addition of [indiscernible], which rounds out our national footprint in Germany, the largest economy in Europe. We continue to explore a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets and M&A remains an important part of our global growth strategy. Additionally, we are benefiting from ongoing initiatives, such as accelerating the rollout of the NAPA brand, our international markets, as well as further investing in B2B and B2C omnichannel enhancements to both our catalog data and technology platforms. We also continue to upgrade our pricing and product category management strategies to further extend our leadership positions in the global automotive and industrial markets. As we look at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive and industrial business are benefiting from several tailwinds. The continued increase in miles driven and the average age of vehicles, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are supporting demand in the automotive aftermarket and driving continued strength in the DIFM segment. In Industrial, PMI continues to signal manufacture and expansion and industrial production showed gains again in the second quarter, representing the eight consecutive quarter of growth. We are closely monitoring potential consumer headwinds, including the effective, historically high inflation and its impact on gas prices, freight and wages. However, we will stay focused on our strategic initiatives and remain agile in the execution of our business on a day-to-day basis. The enthusiasm and momentum in our business was on full display last week, when for the first time in seven years, we hosted our 2022 NAPA Expo in Las Vegas. This gathering brought together more than 15,000 global attendees, including Napa AutoCare customers, independent Napa store owners, Napa store managers, key suppliers and leaders across our operations. It was an extraordinary event packed with seminars, insights, business, building strategies, and an extensive trade show featuring our global suppliers and key business partners. We took the opportunity to introduce our new Napa brand campaign, Get Up & Go. And you could feel the positive energy and excitement for the future of Napa and the automotive aftermarket overall. The biggest takeaway is that the Napa team in the U.S. and across the globe is well positioned for the future. During the quarter, we also had the opportunity to spend time in the field with our Motion leadership team. We visited our operations and customers across the Midwest and saw firsthand the momentum in our industrial business and the progress of the KDG acquisition. As we mentioned in our last call, we have been active in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. This has included formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy, as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We look forward to providing additional details in our progress in these areas later this year, as we publish our 2022 corporate sustainability report. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering another quarter of record results. Now I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the team effort and hard work to deliver great results around the world. During the second quarter, we built on solid momentum and delivered strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by team execution and discipline focused on strategic initiatives. We continue to align our initiatives around five foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology. We will highlight select initiative examples as we review the business performance. Turning to the performance details by segment total sales for our global automotive segment were $3.5 billion in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $271 million or 8.5% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was relatively consistent in all three months of the quarter and on a comparable basis sales growth for the quarter was plus 8%. Our global teams delivered mid-single digit to low double digit comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and focused team execution. Global Automotive segment profit was $323 million and segment operating margin was 9.3%, representing a 20 basis point increase from the same period last year. The improvement in segment profit was driven by strong operating discipline across our operations, despite a dynamic environment. During the second quarter, our automotive business experienced slightly higher product cost inflation compared to the mid-single-digit experience in the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational and we're pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management initiatives. Looking ahead, we believe current levels of inflation will continue through the second half of 2022. Now turning to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of 7%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with breaks, filters and fluids, all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth with many of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which moderated to mid-single-digit growth as expected. Our commercial business representing approximately 80% of U.S. auto sales saw broad based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with low double-digit sales growth during the second quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience. Others select U.S. initiative examples to highlight include the rollout of an enhanced PROLink, our B2B digital commerce platform, new sales and marketing programs, including the new NAPA Get Up and Go brand campaign, pricing and sourcing analytics, inventory and forecasting tools and DC productivity initiatives, to name just a few. In Canada, sales grew approximately 16% in local currency during the second quarter. Comparable sales were up 14% and up 26% on a two-year stack reflective of the continued strength of the reopening of the Canadian market and solid team execution. To highlight an example of emerging technology initiatives, during the second quarter, we officially launched NexDrive in Canada. Originally launched in Europe in 2020, NexDrive is a program that enables our network of automotive service centers to repair next-generation hybrids and EV vehicles. As part of this program, we partner with our vast service center network to offer product training tools and technology. We currently have over 100 NexDrive service centers in the European market and we're excited to bring this offering to the Canadian market. Our emerging technology council comprised of global strategic partners also continues to help inform and advance our strategies. In Europe, our automotive team delivered a terrific quarter as well despite the dynamic geopolitical environment. Sales in Europe increased 19% in local currency in the second quarter. Comparable sales increased 7% for the quarter and are up more than 40% on a two-year stack basis. Growth continues to be driven by continued focus on strategic initiatives. Initiative highlights in Europe include new account expansion, continued NAPA rollout within and across the region and technology and supply chain investments. The recent Lausan and Canol [ph] acquisitions in Spain and Germany respectively are also exceeding our expectations and we're encouraged by the opportunities we're working on to capture in these businesses. In the Asia-Pac automotive business sales in the second quarter increased 11% in local currency from last year. Comparable sales were up 8% from last year and up 26% on a two-year stack, both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco and NAPA growth driven by strong execution of complimentary customer value propositions and robust demand. Our motorcycle accessories division also performed well, benefiting from ongoing store expansion. In addition, during the second quarter, our Asia-Pac team completed the acquisition of Steady [ph], a leading Australian branded direct-to-consumer distributor of lighting products focused on the four-wheel drive market. The acquisition creates a differentiated product offering in a multi-billion dollar profitable high growth segment in Australia and New Zealand. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the second quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $547 million or 34.5%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG increased 18% versus last year. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable growth driven by the strong performance in our North American business. The strength in our North American industrial performance was broad based with double-digit sales growth across virtually all product categories and major industry served with particular strengths coming from equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement and automotive customers. Industrial segment profit was $225 million or 10.6% of sales, a new record for the Industrial segment. This represents a 110 basis point increase from the same period last year. The improvement is a result of Motion\u2019s impressive growth and disciplined operating performance. For the second quarter, inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low-single digit range, consistent with the levels we saw on the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational and we do not expect any significant shifts in product inflation in our industrial business through the balance of 2022. Select initiative highlights contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business include sales programs to capture profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data driven, strategic pricing, and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omni-channel experience and inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives. As Paul mentioned, the KDG acquisition has added to the Motion team momentum. The teams are executing well defined plans with customers, suppliers, and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined business. To provide a bit more commentary on the recent integration progress, the team successfully onboarded KDG associates to Motion HR programs, accelerated the realignment of functional support teams, integrated systems and accelerated the co-location of overlapping branches. In addition, the team partnered with vendors to improve programs and product availability, utilized cross-functional field teams to sell services across shared customers, harmonize inventory strategies and rebranded stores under the Motion banner. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the momentum of the integration efforts and excited for the growth opportunities as one Motion team. As we execute on our global initiatives, we compliment them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. The M&A pipeline continues to be active and will remain discipline to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth, and create long-term value. In summary, we had another terrific quarter, which resulted in record sales and profit for Genuine Parts Company. We acknowledged that the macro environment remains dynamic, but we learned as a team from the challenges presented by the pandemic. We continued to prioritize our customers as we analyze our business indicators remain agile and strategically invest with discipline in initiatives that extend our global leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for an exceptional quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we had an excellent second quarter and I\u2019m pleased to walk you through the key highlights. Our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which exclude non-recurring items that I will cover in more detail shortly. Total GPC sales were $5.6 billion in the second quarter, up $819 million or 17.1% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects an 11.5% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single digit inflation and an 8.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 3.3% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Our gross margin was 35%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to the second quarter last year and in line with our expectations. Our gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by headwinds from anticipated moderation and supplier incentives, foreign currency, and the timing of inflation in certain product categories. These headwinds were substantially offset by the ongoing favorable impact of strategic category management initiatives, where we continue to leverage our growing global scale. As an example of our strategic initiatives and category management, our teams are utilizing technology, innovative data analytics and AI to forecast supply chain lead times and changes in market demand to ensure optimal levels. These actions along with our pricing initiatives positively impacted our gross margin in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect our gross margin rate to be consistent with 2021, as we are relentlessly managing the impact of product and supplier price increases in our costs. Our total operating and non-operating expenses, excluding non-recurring items were approximately $1.5 billion up 15% from 2021 and at 27.6% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales in the prior year. We continue to leverage our expenses despite ongoing inflationary pressures across all costs, particularly in freight and shipping charges. Our teams remain focused on further reducing expenses and driving operational efficiencies across the business. With our strong performance, segment profit was $548 million up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.8%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and up 160 basis points from 2019. With a very challenging operating environment over the past few years, ranging from the pandemic to current inflationary dynamics, we are very proud of the work our teams have done to improve our segment margin over the last three years. As outlined in our earnings release, our second quarter results include two non-recurring items. The first item relates to the sale of S.P. Richards real estate, which generated $140 million in cash proceeds and resulted in a non-recurring gain of $103 million. The S.P. Richards properties sold this quarter were not divested with that business in 2020. And we are extremely pleased to monetize these assets and reinvest this capital across the GPC portfolio. In addition, during the second quarter, we incurred approximately $25 million of costs related to our KDG acquisition, including a non-cash impairment charge of $17 million for legacy motion brand name that will no longer be used as a result of the acquisition of KDG. Our second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $59 million or $0.42 per diluted share and the non-recurring items I just discussed was $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted debt income of $253 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 26%. The strong growth is indicative of the crisp execution of our initiatives to deliver accelerated growth and profitability. As we turn to our balance sheet at June 30, our total accounts receivable balances were up 18% with inventory up 17% and both in line with the increase in sales. Likewise, accounts payable increased 14% from 2021, which correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flows with $392 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $791 million for the six months up 12% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We close the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8 times. This is slightly below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. The key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these included reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A, and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $153 million in capital expenditures, including $75 million in the second quarter and continue to plan for additional strategic investments through the balance of the year. These investments are primarily in technology and projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity throughout the business. Beyond CapEx, during 2022 we have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $366 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $243 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $123 million in cash to repurchase 943,000 shares. As a reminder, we have increased the annual dividend for 66 consecutive years. Turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our first quarter earnings release. We are raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.80 to $7.95, which represents an increase of 13% to 15% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.85. Our revised EPS guidance includes an incremental headwind of approximately $0.08 due to foreign currency relative to the outlook we provided in April. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in a range of 12% to 14%, an increase from 10% to 12% previously. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 6% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from 5% to 7% previously. The new outlook reflects 6% to 8% comp sales growth consistent with our previous estimate. For the Industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to 26% to 28% an increase from our previous outlook of 21% to 23%. The new outlook includes a 9% to 11% comp sales increase, which is up from 5% to 7% previously. We\u2019ve had an exceptional first half of 2022 boosted by our industrial business and the success of our acquisition of KDG along with solid global automotive results. Our outlook for the full year reflects our ongoing confidence in our businesses to execute on our strategies, despite a dynamic and uncertain external landscape. Our continued strong cash flow generation also provides us with full flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return cash to our shareholders through our dividend. We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nQ - Chris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a few questions from a top line perspective, so focusing first on the U.S. NAPA business. Interesting to note that your DIY business was up, some of your peers talked about a late spring impacting sort of the start of the quarter. So can you give us a sense if that customer how consistent that comp cadence was during the quarter? And then moreover, as you think about quarter to date, what are you seeing in the U.S. Walmart pre-announced earlier this week, talking about pressures on the low end consumer and some other companies have said that as well. So just curious if you\u2019re seeing any variation in the DIY side of the business in the U.S.?\nWill Stengel: Yes. Chris, good morning. It\u2019s Will here. Let me take a crack and Bert and Paul can jump in if you have anything to add. So as you alluded to generally speaking U.S. automotive combine, do it for me, do it yourself consistent through the quarter on a monthly basis. I would say, on the do it yourself side, we did see some moderation through the quarter as we expected based on year-over-year comparables. I would say that we\u2019re not reading into a softness in the customer based on what we\u2019re seeing in our data. And so I\u2019m not sure that we have the same takeaway that perhaps some of your traditional retailers are reading through in terms of the help of the consumer.\nPaul Donahue: And I would \u2013 Chris, I would just add onto that, you kind of asked about the current quarter please report that U.S. Automotive continues to be in good shape. The trends we\u2019re seeing in July are very similar to what we saw in Q2. So all is positive on the U.S. Automotive front.\nChris Horvers: So just to double click on that a little bit, the DIY moderation was really just anniversary in stimulus from April of last year?\nPaul Donahue: We agree.\nChris Horvers: And then separately on the Motion business, Motion is doing in incredibly well. One of your peers in the industrial parts distribution business talked about some signs of moderation as they saw other quarter progress and into the current quarter. So curious, if you had any comments on that side as well.\nWill Stengel: Yes, Chris, similarly we saw very consistent strength through the quarter. And as Paul alluded to kind of early looks and commentary around July, we\u2019re seeing that continued strength coming out of the quarter, as well as we had in our prepared remarks. We saw broad strength across all of our end markets. We saw broad strength across all of our product categories. And we spend a lot of time in the field talking with customers, and I would say the mood is cautious, but on the margin quite positive. We\u2019re obviously watching it and cautiously optimistic, but we feel good about what we\u2019re seeing in the business.\nChris Horvers: And one last quick follow on, obviously a lot of questions about, what\u2019s going on in Europe? How\u2019s that business holding up as sort of the years played out with the war and energy prices over in that region?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, I\u2019ll take that Chris. Our European business continues to be rock solid. We had another really good quarter. I could not be more proud of our European team. And we saw it across all of our markets. We saw really nice sales increase in Germany. Our Netherlands business is strong, really pleased to see our business in France, posting mid-single-digits. So all is good there. As you know, we\u2019re not in Russia or Ukraine, and so not necessarily feeling that impact. You mentioned the energy issue, Chris, which obviously is getting a lot of press we\u2019re watching it closely. We are not an energy dependent business. So our DCs, our stores will continue to operate as they always have. So, we\u2019re watching it certainly, we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re a little concerned over the potential for some economic challenges, but again, please to say really strong quarter by our team, and we\u2019re seeing that strength carryover into Q3 as well.\nChris Horvers: Thanks very much. Best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, if I could about the sales guidance, which seems to imply to hit the midpoint for the full year, for example, an automotive, 400 bps to 500 bps of moderation. And then a 10 percentage point plus slow down for industrial. Just wanted to see if that\u2019s kind of more conservatism, if there\u2019s something, in particular that you\u2019re seeing, how we should think about that in light of some of the traction that you\u2019ve discussed for your initiatives?\nBert Nappier: I\u2019ll take that one, its Bert. Hey Mike. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Look first, I\u2019d just like to thank our teams for the tremendous work so far in the first half. And I\u2019ll try to give you some color on the guidance from there. Certainly exceeded our expectations in the first half. The business continues to be very resilient and balanced, but a number of factors were contemplated into how we raised guidance, obviously the sales numbers that I provided in my prepared comments, the outperformance in the first half, and the momentum we see in the underlying business that Paul and Will have talked about. We needed to balance that against the fact that we just can\u2019t ignore that there\u2019s tightening economic conditions that potentially could impact businesses in the second half. So, we\u2019re trying to balance the strength of the first half and our momentum exiting Q2 while being eyes wide open and prudent about what we see out there.  And again, we've already talked about a few of these things with inflation lingering COVID conditions, the geopolitical landscape, ongoing supply chain constraints. So look, on the back half guide for sales our original plan for the year assume some normalization of growth rates in the second half. And our views are really unchanged on that. When you look at a year ago, the outperformance we had in the second half was quite significant and we just can't expect a year-for-year repeat of that level of outperformance. So we moderated that a little bit, look at a normalized growth rate in the second half.  As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do have some FX headwinds that are incremental to our guide in April about $0.08 as we look at that. But look, we're going to stay focused, look for additional growth opportunities in the second half, stay disciplined on costs and look for efficiency gains. But at the end of the day, we're going to improve operating margin and have operating margin expansion for the full year. And we think that's a pretty good outcome.\nMichael Montani: Got it. Thank you. And then if I could follow up just on the cost side, one question bit housekeeping but just how to think about interest expense in light of some of the move up in interest rates? And then secondly on gross margins, given the strong organic growth and then inorganic increases kind of why the supplier incentive pressure there would think you guys might have had some incremental benefits going on there?\nBert Nappier: Yeah, I'll take \u2013 I guess I'll take both of those. Look, I think, we're really in a positive spot on our capital structure. We're at 1.8 times levered that's below our range of two to 2.5 times. We have a very strong investment grade rating. And we look at our debt structure, it's nearly 100% fixed with some episodic borrowing against our revolver usually intra-month. But when you look at that, I don't see a lot of volatility there. We've got a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. The only place we've seen a little bit of pressure is in our AR securitization program, in operating expenses. But it's still very, very attractive capital source for us and really not anything of consequence to call out there. In terms of gross margin, back to your question on that, look we landed at 35% for the quarter that was in line with our own expectations. The underlying execution from our teams, which has been absolutely tremendous in core activities around category management and pricing has driven significant margin improvement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Unfortunately, that's a bit hard to see this quarter. We got three big factors masking that some expected moderation in supplier rebates as you mentioned and I'll talk about that here shortly, foreign currency and inflation.  When you look at the supplier rebates those moderated from a year ago we had some heightened supply chain challenges in the prior year that you're all intimately aware of, and those impacted the amounts we received from our suppliers. And so that's abated a bit, if you recall, we had a 40 basis point margin expansion from those a year ago and so that's as anticipated moderated. The great part about that, the flip side of that is we have more inventory to get to our customers, and we've got a better level of availability to be able to drive through to the business. I'll just land that point with, we expect gross margin for the full year to be consistent with 2021. And again, we think that's a great outcome in this very dynamic environment.\nMichael Montani: Thank you. And good luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Liz Suzuki at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thank you. Just on inflation which is the kind of topic. Sure. What do you think pricing and margins could look like when inflation ultimately moves in the other direction? As in, if we find ourselves in a deflationary environment, can you hold on to price actions you've taken or do you think the competitive environment has changed such that it might get more challenging to keep pricing sticky?\nBert Nappier: Hey, Liz, it\u2019s Bert how you doing? I hope you having a good summer. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll take that one a bit. Look, the inflationary environment has persisted and it's no doubt, a tough dynamic out there for everyone retires, very intense focus from everyone and our teams are doing a great job of managing it and have been able to generally pass along as you pointed out price increases to mitigate the impact. Our strategy there has been to protect gross margin rate, so that's our focus.  If you look at the downside of that, we wouldn't expect to see the environment pull back on pricing. Obviously that would take some time to work through, but we wouldn't see an immediate pullback in the environment. We'll stay competitive on that front and watch the marketplace. But again, I think the bottom line is, we wouldn't see a big pull back in terms of pricing or the pricing environment in general and obviously cost changes take quite some time to work through the supply chain.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you. And just how much of the comp growth in each of your segments? Do you think will be attributable to inflation or your SKU for \u2013 SKU inflation for the year, and as you look out into next year, do you expect that to moderate?\nBert Nappier: I think I\u2019ll start with the back half of your question and just say for the back half of the year, we really, as Will mentioned in his remarks expect inflation levels to stay where they are from here for the rest of the year. That\u2019s how we contemplated it in our guide. That\u2019s a slight uptick from what we saw on the first quarter. And then if you look at it all up for GPC consolidated, we see the impact kind of mid-single digits on the top line within the motion industrial business. That\u2019s low-single digits on the top line. And then for the auto business globally, we see that in the high single digits on the top line for the rest of the year.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Of course.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So just a clarification on that same-SKU inflation concept specifically in the U.S. So are we basically seeing that units are fairly steady or flat with the comp gains coming from rising prices or is there another lever in there we have to be cognizant of?\nBert Nappier: Hey Scot. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s Bert. I\u2019m on a roll here. I\u2019ll keep taking these, yes, I think, the best way to characterize it is how you\u2019ve couched it there. We\u2019d see the environment to flattish in terms of how the U.S. auto business is performing.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then pivot to the European business once again, we know our experience in the U.S. has been when you have a spike in gas prices, people tend to often drive less, they need a little less maintenance, because there\u2019s less wear and tear on the vehicles. Because we have an energy centric challenge for a lot of countries that you guys are operating in Europe and what could become a lot worse in the next call it six, nine months? What is your view and what is your history say regarding those markets? Do they act any differently than what we see in the U.S. or is it pretty consistent kind of geography?\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Scot. This is Paul. I\u2019ll take that. The \u2013 look, the environment we see in Europe in our five years now in that market is very consistent with what we see in the U.S. And look, it\u2019s steady as we\u2019ve seen in the U.S., the automotive aftermarket is incredibly resilient. If there is a recession, which many are predicting, but it remains to be seen. We expect our business to continue to move in a positive direction. So we\u2019re very pleased with our team, with our performance, with our footprint which excludes Eastern Europe and with our performance to date, which has been very, very strong. And as you heard in the quarter Scot, we expanded our footprint first quarter into Spain and certainly expanded our footprint in Germany this past quarter. So we\u2019re in a good place with a great team and with a positive outlook for the balance of the year.\nScot Ciccarelli: Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nPaul Donahue: You bet.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning guys.\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Bret.\nBert Nappier: Hey, Bret,\nBret Jordan: Could you talk about, I think you mentioned fill rates improving. But could you talk about sort of where you are on supply chain improvement and obviously a year ago, first half of 2021, there are a lot of supply constraints, but maybe where are we versus sort of target or normal levels?\nWill Stengel: Yes. It\u2019s Will here. I\u2019ll take that one. So I would characterize global supply chain as stable to slightly improved over the last 100 days. We\u2019ve seen a moderation in our ocean freight rate. I would say that the ports continue to be more congested than average in particular on the East Coast now relative to what we saw early in the year on the West Coast. But the suppliers aren\u2019t experiencing problems, obtaining vessel space, which is a positive development. Lockdowns are moderating over in Asia, which is a positive development. And I think for us as we\u2019ve thought through and worked through these developments, we\u2019ve improved actually how we execute.  So we've rebalanced some of our poor activity. We've rebalanced some of our supplier geographies and we're gaining some nice traction there. So the one thing that I would call out is the transport from port to final destination that is still challenged, whether we're talking rail or freight logistics, but net-net were slightly improved relative to where we were 100 days ago.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And I think you talked about the cadence of the quarter from the sales standpoint. Did you say anything interesting regionally? Is there any real dispersion in U.S. auto?\nPaul Donahue: We sell nice strengths down the Eastern half of the United States. One could make the case that fuel prices on the west coast impacted that given there's so much more elevated relative to the national average, but the Northeast, the Southeast in our Atlantic region showed nice strength through the quarter.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And the final, I guess any sign of trade down you talked about stable consumer demand, but is there any kind of a mix-shift particularly around the lower end consumer where they're looking for the lower price point option?\nBert Nappier: Hey, Bret, it's Bert. I'll take that one and look we're not just \u2013 we're not seeing much evidence of consumers trading down, customers trading down at all. I think the customer's been pretty resilient despite the rising fuel prices and other inflationary pressures. When you look at the auto business, it's non-discretionary to a large degree; you need your car fixed in this environment, particularly with a shortage of new cars and higher use of car prices as well. So customers are focusing on availability and service, which is our sweet spot and we've got product readily available. Same on the industrial side we're not seeing a pull back there. The momentum continues as you saw in our Q2 results. And so we just really continue to focus on as Will talked about supply chain, inventory management and having the right product in the right place.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey, good morning guys, thanks. I wanted to circle back on the pricing backdrop. Obviously it's been topical with some of your big peers investing in price. It sounds like you guys aren't really feeling the impact of that yet. I guess first is it still true, you guys really aren't feeling any discernible impact? And then Will, if not using price, you talk through a number of initiatives in you're prepared remarks on the auto side. Can you talk about which of those you expect to drive the most share gains or kind of what you guys are leaning into as you look out to next year and get back to share gains not just recouping some of the underperformance during COVID?\nWill Stengel: Yes. Daniel, let me see if I can't break down your questions. First piece was, are we seeing any impact from competitive pricing strategies in the market? And I would tell you that we're not seeing an impact from anything that's been announced by competitors as it relates to pricing the market continues to be rational. And as we've talked a lot about here we're doing our own strategic work around pricing to be agile and react to the market and super proud of the team there. The second part of your question was which part of our initiative stack is driving share gains near term and recently? And all of our work around sales force effectiveness obviously is turning into nice momentum. The pricing work is turning into nice momentum and all of our technology investments that's improving the customer experience and making us easier to do business with. And while I talk about, I think your question was U.S. auto specific, all of those initiatives are relevant as we look around the globe. We have flavors and versions of all of those same initiatives which I think is contributing to very nice global broad-based strength.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes, that's helpful. And then Paul, maybe follow-up on the industrial piece; you guys talked about momentum continuing through the second quarter across all of your end markets. It is still true about half that business is contracted. So you guys have good visibility into the back half of this year. And then just within those end markets and quarter-to-date, are you seeing any signs of weakness among different end markets or any particular concerns you see there?\nPaul Donahue: No. And you are correct, Daniel. It is about half of our business is under contract and pleased to say we are not seeing any signs of slowdown in our business segments. And certainly we could call out a few that were continuing to see accelerate as we go into the second half. So yes, industrial is performing incredibly well as you've heard throughout this call.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. I'll leave it there. Best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Thanks Daniel.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's final question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning guys. My first question is just around the outlook for, especially the U.S. NAPA business. Just thinking about the trends and miles driven as gas prices are still very elevated. Do you expect pressure on your business units declining perhaps on a comparable store basis in the U.S. in the back half of the year, as we see some of the moderation and key leading indicators for your business?\nBert Nappier: Hey, Seth its Bert. I'll take that, maybe will have a little will can have a little perspective to add to it as well. But look, I think our guidance assumes that we continue to perform, as Paul said as well in the U.S. auto business. It's a dynamic environment out there. You see gas prices dropping and over the last several weeks. So that's a positive in terms of miles driven. We continue to look at that very closely; miles driven were up a little over 1% in May. Most recent data we've seen. And so I think the underlying fundamentals remain very robust for that market. You got the average age of a car up for the fifth consecutive year. You've got all time, low scrap rates. You have pent-up demand for travel. I think, across the U.S. in terms of people wanting to get out and take vacations. And so I think the underlying fundamental for the marketplace is there to continue to perform well. And our guide reflects that.\nPaul Donahue: I would just add on to that Seth. Bert mentioned gasoline is coming down and it's coming down quickly. It's been its down. I think, I heard this morning, $0.17 in the past week. And what we're seeing is an incredibly resilient consumer. We heard from our friends at AAA 88% of travelers over the July 4th weekend, which gasoline was well over $5 a gallon in that timeframe. 88% of travelers were on the road in their vehicles. So as always the automotive aftermarket is incredibly resilient. I think our consumers are pretty resilient. So we're feeling, good about our NAPA business in the second half.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thanks. And then a follow up question on a competitive environment and some of the big competitor\u2019s price investments. You're not seeing any major impact, but as the supply situation improves for WDs, do you expect that change the competitive environment at all?\nBert Nappier: I don't think we do Seth.\nPaul Donahue: It remains to be seen Seth, but look I think the improvements we're seeing in our NAPA business, we saw it firsthand last week. We had 15,000 of our NAPA store owners, auto care centers. The positive momentum we have coming out of that conference. The positive momentum that I hear from our teams and our independent owners our NAPA auto care centers are major accounts. Our guys are in a good place. And I expect that to continue in the second half of the year.\nBert Nappier: Seth, I would just, I would also add, I think this is a market where scale really matters. I think we've talked about that before. And so as product comes into the market, I think your scale and your global relationships make a difference. So we feel like that, that's a nice tailwind for us as we move forward.\nSeth Basham: Good to hear. Thank you very much.\nPaul Donahue: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen I\u2019m showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to the management team for any final remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Yes, thanks Roco [ph]. And to, all of our participating analyst out there. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for participating. And look, I\u2019ve just closed with our teams are doing great work. We couldn't be more proud of the results we turned in Q2. And as we look ahead to Q3 and the balance of 2022, we continue to believe GPC is really well positioned with the financial strength to continue to support our growth plan. So listen, thanks again for your interest in GPC. Enjoy your summer, and we'll see you in October. Thanks.\nBert Nappier: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC teams as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the team effort and hard work to deliver great results around the world. During the second quarter, we built on solid momentum and delivered strong results across both our automotive and industrial businesses. Our results were driven by team execution and discipline focused on strategic initiatives. We continue to align our initiatives around five foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology. We will highlight select initiative examples as we review the business performance. Turning to the performance details by segment total sales for our global automotive segment were $3.5 billion in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $271 million or 8.5% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was relatively consistent in all three months of the quarter and on a comparable basis sales growth for the quarter was plus 8%. Our global teams delivered mid-single digit to low double digit comp growth across each of our operations. And as Paul mentioned, the automotive segment continues to be driven by solid industry fundamentals and focused team execution. Global Automotive segment profit was $323 million and segment operating margin was 9.3%, representing a 20 basis point increase from the same period last year. The improvement in segment profit was driven by strong operating discipline across our operations, despite a dynamic environment. During the second quarter, our automotive business experienced slightly higher product cost inflation compared to the mid-single-digit experience in the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational and we're pleased with the ongoing positive impact of our category management initiatives. Looking ahead, we believe current levels of inflation will continue through the second half of 2022. Now turning to an overview of our automotive businesses by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 11% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of 7%. Sales were solid across each U.S. region and broadly across product categories with breaks, filters and fluids, all posting double-digit increases in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with market share growth with many of our categories. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with low double-digit commercial growth outpacing retail, which moderated to mid-single-digit growth as expected. Our commercial business representing approximately 80% of U.S. auto sales saw broad based strength across all customer segments. Digital channels across all customers also performed well with low double-digit sales growth during the second quarter, reflecting continued traction from investments in our omnichannel experience. Others select U.S. initiative examples to highlight include the rollout of an enhanced PROLink, our B2B digital commerce platform, new sales and marketing programs, including the new NAPA Get Up and Go brand campaign, pricing and sourcing analytics, inventory and forecasting tools and DC productivity initiatives, to name just a few. In Canada, sales grew approximately 16% in local currency during the second quarter. Comparable sales were up 14% and up 26% on a two-year stack reflective of the continued strength of the reopening of the Canadian market and solid team execution. To highlight an example of emerging technology initiatives, during the second quarter, we officially launched NexDrive in Canada. Originally launched in Europe in 2020, NexDrive is a program that enables our network of automotive service centers to repair next-generation hybrids and EV vehicles. As part of this program, we partner with our vast service center network to offer product training tools and technology. We currently have over 100 NexDrive service centers in the European market and we're excited to bring this offering to the Canadian market. Our emerging technology council comprised of global strategic partners also continues to help inform and advance our strategies. In Europe, our automotive team delivered a terrific quarter as well despite the dynamic geopolitical environment. Sales in Europe increased 19% in local currency in the second quarter. Comparable sales increased 7% for the quarter and are up more than 40% on a two-year stack basis. Growth continues to be driven by continued focus on strategic initiatives. Initiative highlights in Europe include new account expansion, continued NAPA rollout within and across the region and technology and supply chain investments. The recent Lausan and Canol [ph] acquisitions in Spain and Germany respectively are also exceeding our expectations and we're encouraged by the opportunities we're working on to capture in these businesses. In the Asia-Pac automotive business sales in the second quarter increased 11% in local currency from last year. Comparable sales were up 8% from last year and up 26% on a two-year stack, both commercial and retail sales performed well with Repco and NAPA growth driven by strong execution of complimentary customer value propositions and robust demand. Our motorcycle accessories division also performed well, benefiting from ongoing store expansion. In addition, during the second quarter, our Asia-Pac team completed the acquisition of Steady [ph], a leading Australian branded direct-to-consumer distributor of lighting products focused on the four-wheel drive market. The acquisition creates a differentiated product offering in a multi-billion dollar profitable high growth segment in Australia and New Zealand. Turning to the Global Industrial segment. During the second quarter, total sales at Motion were $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $547 million or 34.5%. The sales cadence was consistently strong throughout the quarter and comparable sales, which exclude the benefit of KDG increased 18% versus last year. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable growth driven by the strong performance in our North American business. The strength in our North American industrial performance was broad based with double-digit sales growth across virtually all product categories and major industry served with particular strengths coming from equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement and automotive customers. Industrial segment profit was $225 million or 10.6% of sales, a new record for the Industrial segment. This represents a 110 basis point increase from the same period last year. The improvement is a result of Motion's impressive growth and disciplined operating performance. For the second quarter, inflation in the Industrial segment held in the low-single digit range, consistent with the levels we saw on the first quarter. The pricing environment remains rational and we do not expect any significant shifts in product inflation in our industrial business through the balance of 2022. Select initiative highlights contributing to the strong performance in the industrial business include sales programs to capture profitable share of wallet with target accounts, data driven, strategic pricing, and sourcing programs, technology investments to enhance the omni-channel experience and inventory productivity and footprint optimization initiatives. As Paul mentioned, the KDG acquisition has added to the Motion team momentum. The teams are executing well defined plans with customers, suppliers, and teammates to deliver growth and create value as a combined business. To provide a bit more commentary on the recent integration progress, the team successfully onboarded KDG associates to Motion HR programs, accelerated the realignment of functional support teams, integrated systems and accelerated the co-location of overlapping branches. In addition, the team partnered with vendors to improve programs and product availability, utilized cross-functional field teams to sell services across shared customers, harmonize inventory strategies and rebranded stores under the Motion banner. All major work streams are at or ahead of plan. We're extremely pleased with the momentum of the integration efforts and excited for the growth opportunities as one Motion team. As we execute on our global initiatives, we compliment them with strategic bolt-on acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. The M&A pipeline continues to be active and will remain discipline to pursue transactions that advance our strategy, deliver profitable growth, and create long-term value. In summary, we had another terrific quarter, which resulted in record sales and profit for Genuine Parts Company. We acknowledged that the macro environment remains dynamic, but we learned as a team from the challenges presented by the pandemic. We continued to prioritize our customers as we analyze our business indicators remain agile and strategically invest with discipline in initiatives that extend our global leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for an exceptional quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Yes. Chris, good morning. It's Will here. Let me take a crack and Bert and Paul can jump in if you have anything to add. So as you alluded to generally speaking U.S. automotive combine, do it for me, do it yourself consistent through the quarter on a monthly basis. I would say, on the do it yourself side, we did see some moderation through the quarter as we expected based on year-over-year comparables. I would say that we're not reading into a softness in the customer based on what we're seeing in our data. And so I'm not sure that we have the same takeaway that perhaps some of your traditional retailers are reading through in terms of the help of the consumer. Yes, Chris, similarly we saw very consistent strength through the quarter. And as Paul alluded to kind of early looks and commentary around July, we're seeing that continued strength coming out of the quarter, as well as we had in our prepared remarks. We saw broad strength across all of our end markets. We saw broad strength across all of our product categories. And we spend a lot of time in the field talking with customers, and I would say the mood is cautious, but on the margin quite positive. We're obviously watching it and cautiously optimistic, but we feel good about what we're seeing in the business. Yes. It's Will here. I'll take that one. So I would characterize global supply chain as stable to slightly improved over the last 100 days. We've seen a moderation in our ocean freight rate. I would say that the ports continue to be more congested than average in particular on the East Coast now relative to what we saw early in the year on the West Coast. But the suppliers aren't experiencing problems, obtaining vessel space, which is a positive development. Lockdowns are moderating over in Asia, which is a positive development. And I think for us as we've thought through and worked through these developments, we've improved actually how we execute.  So we've rebalanced some of our poor activity. We've rebalanced some of our supplier geographies and we're gaining some nice traction there. So the one thing that I would call out is the transport from port to final destination that is still challenged, whether we're talking rail or freight logistics, but net-net were slightly improved relative to where we were 100 days ago. Yes. Daniel, let me see if I can't break down your questions. First piece was, are we seeing any impact from competitive pricing strategies in the market? And I would tell you that we're not seeing an impact from anything that's been announced by competitors as it relates to pricing the market continues to be rational. And as we've talked a lot about here we're doing our own strategic work around pricing to be agile and react to the market and super proud of the team there. The second part of your question was which part of our initiative stack is driving share gains near term and recently? And all of our work around sales force effectiveness obviously is turning into nice momentum. The pricing work is turning into nice momentum and all of our technology investments that's improving the customer experience and making us easier to do business with. And while I talk about, I think your question was U.S. auto specific, all of those initiatives are relevant as we look around the globe. We have flavors and versions of all of those same initiatives which I think is contributing to very nice global broad-based strength."

            "name": "Bert Nappier",
            "content": "Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Paul and Will have shared, we had an excellent second quarter and I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights. Our comments this morning focused primarily on our adjusted quarterly results, which exclude non-recurring items that I will cover in more detail shortly. Total GPC sales were $5.6 billion in the second quarter, up $819 million or 17.1% from last year. Our increase in total sales reflects an 11.5% increase in comparable sales, including mid-single digit inflation and an 8.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 3.3% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Our gross margin was 35%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to the second quarter last year and in line with our expectations. Our gross margin in the second quarter was negatively impacted by headwinds from anticipated moderation and supplier incentives, foreign currency, and the timing of inflation in certain product categories. These headwinds were substantially offset by the ongoing favorable impact of strategic category management initiatives, where we continue to leverage our growing global scale. As an example of our strategic initiatives and category management, our teams are utilizing technology, innovative data analytics and AI to forecast supply chain lead times and changes in market demand to ensure optimal levels. These actions along with our pricing initiatives positively impacted our gross margin in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect our gross margin rate to be consistent with 2021, as we are relentlessly managing the impact of product and supplier price increases in our costs. Our total operating and non-operating expenses, excluding non-recurring items were approximately $1.5 billion up 15% from 2021 and at 27.6% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales in the prior year. We continue to leverage our expenses despite ongoing inflationary pressures across all costs, particularly in freight and shipping charges. Our teams remain focused on further reducing expenses and driving operational efficiencies across the business. With our strong performance, segment profit was $548 million up 24%, and our segment profit margin was 9.8%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and up 160 basis points from 2019. With a very challenging operating environment over the past few years, ranging from the pandemic to current inflationary dynamics, we are very proud of the work our teams have done to improve our segment margin over the last three years. As outlined in our earnings release, our second quarter results include two non-recurring items. The first item relates to the sale of S.P. Richards real estate, which generated $140 million in cash proceeds and resulted in a non-recurring gain of $103 million. The S.P. Richards properties sold this quarter were not divested with that business in 2020. And we are extremely pleased to monetize these assets and reinvest this capital across the GPC portfolio. In addition, during the second quarter, we incurred approximately $25 million of costs related to our KDG acquisition, including a non-cash impairment charge of $17 million for legacy motion brand name that will no longer be used as a result of the acquisition of KDG. Our second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes $59 million or $0.42 per diluted share and the non-recurring items I just discussed was $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted debt income of $253 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 26%. The strong growth is indicative of the crisp execution of our initiatives to deliver accelerated growth and profitability. As we turn to our balance sheet at June 30, our total accounts receivable balances were up 18% with inventory up 17% and both in line with the increase in sales. Likewise, accounts payable increased 14% from 2021, which correlates to the increase in inventory. We continue to generate strong cash flows with $392 million in cash from operations in the second quarter and $791 million for the six months up 12% from last year. For the full year, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range with free cash flow of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We close the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.8 times. This is slightly below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, and highlights our financial strength and flexibility. The key priorities for capital allocation at GPC remain unchanged. As a reminder, these included reinvestment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A, and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2022, we have invested $153 million in capital expenditures, including $75 million in the second quarter and continue to plan for additional strategic investments through the balance of the year. These investments are primarily in technology and projects to further automate and consolidate our distribution networks and drive productivity throughout the business. Beyond CapEx, during 2022 we have also invested $1.6 billion for acquisitions and returned $366 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $243 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $123 million in cash to repurchase 943,000 shares. As a reminder, we have increased the annual dividend for 66 consecutive years. Turning to our current outlook for 2022. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our first quarter earnings release. We are raising adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.80 to $7.95, which represents an increase of 13% to 15% from 2021 and up from our previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.85. Our revised EPS guidance includes an incremental headwind of approximately $0.08 due to foreign currency relative to the outlook we provided in April. We expect total sales growth for 2022 to be in a range of 12% to 14%, an increase from 10% to 12% previously. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 6% to 8% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from 5% to 7% previously. The new outlook reflects 6% to 8% comp sales growth consistent with our previous estimate. For the Industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to 26% to 28% an increase from our previous outlook of 21% to 23%. The new outlook includes a 9% to 11% comp sales increase, which is up from 5% to 7% previously. We've had an exceptional first half of 2022 boosted by our industrial business and the success of our acquisition of KDG along with solid global automotive results. Our outlook for the full year reflects our ongoing confidence in our businesses to execute on our strategies, despite a dynamic and uncertain external landscape. Our continued strong cash flow generation also provides us with full flexibility to continue to invest in the business and return cash to our shareholders through our dividend. We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. I'll take that one, its Bert. Hey Mike. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Look first, I'd just like to thank our teams for the tremendous work so far in the first half. And I'll try to give you some color on the guidance from there. Certainly exceeded our expectations in the first half. The business continues to be very resilient and balanced, but a number of factors were contemplated into how we raised guidance, obviously the sales numbers that I provided in my prepared comments, the outperformance in the first half, and the momentum we see in the underlying business that Paul and Will have talked about. We needed to balance that against the fact that we just can't ignore that there's tightening economic conditions that potentially could impact businesses in the second half. So, we're trying to balance the strength of the first half and our momentum exiting Q2 while being eyes wide open and prudent about what we see out there.  And again, we've already talked about a few of these things with inflation lingering COVID conditions, the geopolitical landscape, ongoing supply chain constraints. So look, on the back half guide for sales our original plan for the year assume some normalization of growth rates in the second half. And our views are really unchanged on that. When you look at a year ago, the outperformance we had in the second half was quite significant and we just can't expect a year-for-year repeat of that level of outperformance. So we moderated that a little bit, look at a normalized growth rate in the second half.  As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do have some FX headwinds that are incremental to our guide in April about $0.08 as we look at that. But look, we're going to stay focused, look for additional growth opportunities in the second half, stay disciplined on costs and look for efficiency gains. But at the end of the day, we're going to improve operating margin and have operating margin expansion for the full year. And we think that's a pretty good outcome. Yeah, I'll take \u2013 I guess I'll take both of those. Look, I think, we're really in a positive spot on our capital structure. We're at 1.8 times levered that's below our range of two to 2.5 times. We have a very strong investment grade rating. And we look at our debt structure, it's nearly 100% fixed with some episodic borrowing against our revolver usually intra-month. But when you look at that, I don't see a lot of volatility there. We've got a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%. The only place we've seen a little bit of pressure is in our AR securitization program, in operating expenses. But it's still very, very attractive capital source for us and really not anything of consequence to call out there. In terms of gross margin, back to your question on that, look we landed at 35% for the quarter that was in line with our own expectations. The underlying execution from our teams, which has been absolutely tremendous in core activities around category management and pricing has driven significant margin improvement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Unfortunately, that's a bit hard to see this quarter. We got three big factors masking that some expected moderation in supplier rebates as you mentioned and I'll talk about that here shortly, foreign currency and inflation.  When you look at the supplier rebates those moderated from a year ago we had some heightened supply chain challenges in the prior year that you're all intimately aware of, and those impacted the amounts we received from our suppliers. And so that's abated a bit, if you recall, we had a 40 basis point margin expansion from those a year ago and so that's as anticipated moderated. The great part about that, the flip side of that is we have more inventory to get to our customers, and we've got a better level of availability to be able to drive through to the business. I'll just land that point with, we expect gross margin for the full year to be consistent with 2021. And again, we think that's a great outcome in this very dynamic environment. Hey, Liz, it's Bert how you doing? I hope you having a good summer. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll take that one a bit. Look, the inflationary environment has persisted and it's no doubt, a tough dynamic out there for everyone retires, very intense focus from everyone and our teams are doing a great job of managing it and have been able to generally pass along as you pointed out price increases to mitigate the impact. Our strategy there has been to protect gross margin rate, so that's our focus.  If you look at the downside of that, we wouldn't expect to see the environment pull back on pricing. Obviously that would take some time to work through, but we wouldn't see an immediate pullback in the environment. We'll stay competitive on that front and watch the marketplace. But again, I think the bottom line is, we wouldn't see a big pull back in terms of pricing or the pricing environment in general and obviously cost changes take quite some time to work through the supply chain. I think I'll start with the back half of your question and just say for the back half of the year, we really, as Will mentioned in his remarks expect inflation levels to stay where they are from here for the rest of the year. That's how we contemplated it in our guide. That's a slight uptick from what we saw on the first quarter. And then if you look at it all up for GPC consolidated, we see the impact kind of mid-single digits on the top line within the motion industrial business. That's low-single digits on the top line. And then for the auto business globally, we see that in the high single digits on the top line for the rest of the year. Of course. Hey Scot. Thanks for the question. It's Bert. I'm on a roll here. I'll keep taking these, yes, I think, the best way to characterize it is how you've couched it there. We'd see the environment to flattish in terms of how the U.S. auto business is performing. Hey, Bret, Hey, Bret, it's Bert. I'll take that one and look we're not just \u2013 we're not seeing much evidence of consumers trading down, customers trading down at all. I think the customer's been pretty resilient despite the rising fuel prices and other inflationary pressures. When you look at the auto business, it's non-discretionary to a large degree; you need your car fixed in this environment, particularly with a shortage of new cars and higher use of car prices as well. So customers are focusing on availability and service, which is our sweet spot and we've got product readily available. Same on the industrial side we're not seeing a pull back there. The momentum continues as you saw in our Q2 results. And so we just really continue to focus on as Will talked about supply chain, inventory management and having the right product in the right place. Thank you. Thanks Daniel. Hey, Seth its Bert. I'll take that, maybe will have a little will can have a little perspective to add to it as well. But look, I think our guidance assumes that we continue to perform, as Paul said as well in the U.S. auto business. It's a dynamic environment out there. You see gas prices dropping and over the last several weeks. So that's a positive in terms of miles driven. We continue to look at that very closely; miles driven were up a little over 1% in May. Most recent data we've seen. And so I think the underlying fundamentals remain very robust for that market. You got the average age of a car up for the fifth consecutive year. You've got all time, low scrap rates. You have pent-up demand for travel. I think, across the U.S. in terms of people wanting to get out and take vacations. And so I think the underlying fundamental for the marketplace is there to continue to perform well. And our guide reflects that. I don't think we do Seth. Seth, I would just, I would also add, I think this is a market where scale really matters. I think we've talked about that before. And so as product comes into the market, I think your scale and your global relationships make a difference. So we feel like that, that's a nice tailwind for us as we move forward. Thanks everyone."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, I'm here with Will as well as Bert, who was on his first earnings call as CFO. Welcome to the call Bert. We are pleased to report continued strong results from Genuine Parts Company in the second quarter of 2022. The GPC team had another record quarter consisting of double-digit sales and earnings increases and a steady cadence of continued growth throughout April, May and June. Total sales were $5.6 billion, up 17%, and adjusted earnings per share were $2.20, up 26% from last year. We continue to benefit from the resiliency of our automotive and industrial businesses and the strategic mix of our operations. We would like to thank our 53,000 talented GPC teammates for their exceptional work and commitment to excellence. A few highlights in the quarter include another quarterly sales record for GPC and our automotive and industrial segment, segment operating margin expansion in both segments and for GPC overall, record quarterly earnings and double-digit EPS growth for the eighth consecutive quarter and strong cash flow generation and the further strengthening of our balance sheet. We continue to execute our key strategic initiatives to deliver market share gains and drive positive momentum in our top and bottom line results despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Our teams are doing an excellent job of navigating supply chain disruptions, enabling our business with the product we need to serve our customers and capture market share. For example, we are investing in our businesses to enhance forecast accuracy for product demand, improve fill rates and optimize our network footprint. Our size and global scale continue to be an advantage as we work to have the right part in the right place at the right time. Likewise, our pricing strategies have proven valuable in substantially offsetting product inflation and rising freight cost. Our M&A strategy has also been effective. As you will hear from Will, the accelerated integration of KDG has been executed with a high degree of precision and has had a meaningful impact on our industrial performance. In addition, our global automotive teams have been active with ongoing strategic bolt-on acquisitions, such as the addition of [indiscernible], which rounds out our national footprint in Germany, the largest economy in Europe. We continue to explore a healthy pipeline of acquisition targets and M&A remains an important part of our global growth strategy. Additionally, we are benefiting from ongoing initiatives, such as accelerating the rollout of the NAPA brand, our international markets, as well as further investing in B2B and B2C omnichannel enhancements to both our catalog data and technology platforms. We also continue to upgrade our pricing and product category management strategies to further extend our leadership positions in the global automotive and industrial markets. As we look at the operating environment more broadly, our automotive and industrial business are benefiting from several tailwinds. The continued increase in miles driven and the average age of vehicles, limited new car inventory and elevated used car prices are supporting demand in the automotive aftermarket and driving continued strength in the DIFM segment. In Industrial, PMI continues to signal manufacture and expansion and industrial production showed gains again in the second quarter, representing the eight consecutive quarter of growth. We are closely monitoring potential consumer headwinds, including the effective, historically high inflation and its impact on gas prices, freight and wages. However, we will stay focused on our strategic initiatives and remain agile in the execution of our business on a day-to-day basis. The enthusiasm and momentum in our business was on full display last week, when for the first time in seven years, we hosted our 2022 NAPA Expo in Las Vegas. This gathering brought together more than 15,000 global attendees, including Napa AutoCare customers, independent Napa store owners, Napa store managers, key suppliers and leaders across our operations. It was an extraordinary event packed with seminars, insights, business, building strategies, and an extensive trade show featuring our global suppliers and key business partners. We took the opportunity to introduce our new Napa brand campaign, Get Up & Go. And you could feel the positive energy and excitement for the future of Napa and the automotive aftermarket overall. The biggest takeaway is that the Napa team in the U.S. and across the globe is well positioned for the future. During the quarter, we also had the opportunity to spend time in the field with our Motion leadership team. We visited our operations and customers across the Midwest and saw firsthand the momentum in our industrial business and the progress of the KDG acquisition. As we mentioned in our last call, we have been active in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. This has included formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy, as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We look forward to providing additional details in our progress in these areas later this year, as we publish our 2022 corporate sustainability report. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering another quarter of record results. Now I'll turn the call over to Will. And I would \u2013 Chris, I would just add onto that, you kind of asked about the current quarter please report that U.S. Automotive continues to be in good shape. The trends we're seeing in July are very similar to what we saw in Q2. So all is positive on the U.S. Automotive front. We agree. Yes, I'll take that Chris. Our European business continues to be rock solid. We had another really good quarter. I could not be more proud of our European team. And we saw it across all of our markets. We saw really nice sales increase in Germany. Our Netherlands business is strong, really pleased to see our business in France, posting mid-single-digits. So all is good there. As you know, we're not in Russia or Ukraine, and so not necessarily feeling that impact. You mentioned the energy issue, Chris, which obviously is getting a lot of press we're watching it closely. We are not an energy dependent business. So our DCs, our stores will continue to operate as they always have. So, we're watching it certainly, we're concerned, we're a little concerned over the potential for some economic challenges, but again, please to say really strong quarter by our team, and we're seeing that strength carryover into Q3 as well. Yes. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Mike. Hey, Scot. This is Paul. I'll take that. The \u2013 look, the environment we see in Europe in our five years now in that market is very consistent with what we see in the U.S. And look, it's steady as we've seen in the U.S., the automotive aftermarket is incredibly resilient. If there is a recession, which many are predicting, but it remains to be seen. We expect our business to continue to move in a positive direction. So we're very pleased with our team, with our performance, with our footprint which excludes Eastern Europe and with our performance to date, which has been very, very strong. And as you heard in the quarter Scot, we expanded our footprint first quarter into Spain and certainly expanded our footprint in Germany this past quarter. So we're in a good place with a great team and with a positive outlook for the balance of the year. You bet. Hey, Bret. We sell nice strengths down the Eastern half of the United States. One could make the case that fuel prices on the west coast impacted that given there's so much more elevated relative to the national average, but the Northeast, the Southeast in our Atlantic region showed nice strength through the quarter. No. And you are correct, Daniel. It is about half of our business is under contract and pleased to say we are not seeing any signs of slowdown in our business segments. And certainly we could call out a few that were continuing to see accelerate as we go into the second half. So yes, industrial is performing incredibly well as you've heard throughout this call. Thank you. I would just add on to that Seth. Bert mentioned gasoline is coming down and it's coming down quickly. It's been its down. I think, I heard this morning, $0.17 in the past week. And what we're seeing is an incredibly resilient consumer. We heard from our friends at AAA 88% of travelers over the July 4th weekend, which gasoline was well over $5 a gallon in that timeframe. 88% of travelers were on the road in their vehicles. So as always the automotive aftermarket is incredibly resilient. I think our consumers are pretty resilient. So we're feeling, good about our NAPA business in the second half. It remains to be seen Seth, but look I think the improvements we're seeing in our NAPA business, we saw it firsthand last week. We had 15,000 of our NAPA store owners, auto care centers. The positive momentum we have coming out of that conference. The positive momentum that I hear from our teams and our independent owners our NAPA auto care centers are major accounts. Our guys are in a good place. And I expect that to continue in the second half of the year. Okay, thank you. Yes, thanks Roco [ph]. And to, all of our participating analyst out there. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for participating. And look, I've just closed with our teams are doing great work. We couldn't be more proud of the results we turned in Q2. And as we look ahead to Q3 and the balance of 2022, we continue to believe GPC is really well positioned with the financial strength to continue to support our growth plan. So listen, thanks again for your interest in GPC. Enjoy your summer, and we'll see you in October. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSid Jones: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President; Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bert Nappier, our EVP and CFO-Elect.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, we\u2019re happy to have Bert Nappier on the call with us today. Bert joined us on February 28 as CFO-Elect and has been working side by side with Carol to ensure a smooth transition in this key role. Turning to the first quarter, we were pleased with the continued strength and our results to start the year and we\u2019re proud of the great work by all of our 52,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. A few highlights in the quarter include new quarterly sales records for GPC and our automotive and industrial segment, segment margin expansion of 50 basis points, strong double-digit EPS growth and a strengthened balance sheet and strong cash flow. The GPC team is focused on key strategic priorities to sustain accelerated sales growth, improved gross margins and enhanced operational efficiencies in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures at levels we haven\u2019t seen in 40 plus years. We also executed on our acquisition strategy and our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of Kaman Distribution Group. And with the addition of Lausan, which we announced last week, we\u2019ve expanded our automotive footprint in Europe, with the entry into key markets in Spain and Portugal, Europe\u2019s fifth largest market. For the first quarter, total sales were 5.3 billion, a 19% increase from last year. We delivered our 18th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. All in adjusted earnings per share were up 24%, representing our seventh straight quarter of double digit EPS growth. Total sales for global automotive were 3.3 billion for the quarter, and 11% increase from 2021 and representing 62% of total company\u2019s sales. On a comp basis, sales were up 10% driven by low double digit comps in the US and Canada and high single digit sales comps in Europe and Australasia. This sales cadence through the quarter was relatively steady with our strongest performance coming in the month of March with our team\u2019s posting a 30 plus percent increase on a two years stack. Our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales. And we have maintained our gross margins despite mid-single digit inflation for the quarter. As we look ahead, we believe the sales environment continues to support our pricing actions and we expect current levels of inflation to continue through at least the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our strongest Q1 comps were in North America. In Canada, the continued reopening of the economy drove strong demand, and a 14% increase in total sales, with comp sales up 13%. In the US, total sales were up 14.5%, with comp sales up 12% from last year. These results reflect strengthening trends on our two year stacks for both markets. In the US, sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive, with double-digit commercial sales growth outperforming DIY. In addition, ticket and traffic counts were both positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Sales were strong across a number of product categories such as brakes, heating and cooling, and chassis. DIY sales continue to trend well above historical growth rates with enhanced in-store merchandising, improved product assortment, and our digital initiatives all driving solid growth. NAPA online continues to be our fastest growing sales channel, up nearly 50% from last year. In addition, our AfterPay payments service, which offers existing and new customers buy now pay later option has been well received by consumers and is driving higher basket sizes. We have launched AfterPay in other global markets and we are excited to see the growth generated from this new service, both online and in-store. The strength in commercial sales was driven by double-digit growth across the majority of our customer segment. Sales to our major account partners, NAPA auto care centers, fleet, government, and other wholesale customers were all strong, driven by the continued strength and demand for commercial repairs and maintenance. Our sales teams were also effective in attracting new business with national and regional accounts, fleets and auto care accounts, so an outstanding job by our teams and strong results across all our commercial accounts. Furthering our commitment to the commercial segment, we are excited to return to the classroom with in-person training for our auto technicians across the industry. NAPA Auto Tech provides industry leading virtual online and classroom training programs as a value added service for over 50,000 technicians each year. We are particularly proud to have more than 2000 new techs in our accredited training program. Our European operations also had a strong start to the year with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. These results reflect solid growth across each of our seven European markets, and are especially impressive given the headwinds of a mild winter across Europe. Our AAG team continues to drive share gains through key account expansion and the continued rollout of NAPA branded products. As announced last week, we expanded our presence into key markets in Spain and Portugal with the addition of Lausan. Lausan is a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts based in Bilbao, Spain, with a nationwide footprint including one national distribution center, and nine regional DC servicing over 14,000 customer partners and key account. With our entree into Spain and Portugal, both highly fragmented markets, we expect to further strengthen Lausan\u2019s market-leading position by capitalizing on our European scale and purchasing expertise as well as leveraging our NAPA brand. We welcome the Lausan team to the GPC family and we are excited to work together to maximize the growth opportunities in our European business. In our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 10% from 2021 with comp sales up 8% and the strongest two years sales tax across our automotive operations. This represents a terrific start to 2022, despite the headwinds posed by the COVID outbreak and severe flooding during the quarter. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by the increased demand and share gains from accelerated digital strategies and store expansion. With 2022 representing Repco\u2019s 100th anniversary, it\u2019s only fitting the Asia Pac team would have a standout year. So now let\u2019s discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were 2 billion for the quarter, a 34% increase from last year and representing 38% of total GPC sales. On a comp basis, which excludes KDG, sales were up 16%, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit comps, driven primarily by the strong growth in our North American business. The sales cadence strengthened throughout the quarter with March being the strongest of the three months. The strong sales momentum in our industrial business reflects the benefits of our many growth initiatives and continued strength of the industrial economy, as evidenced by the PMI and industrial production indices. PMI has consistently held at expansionary levels of 57 or above every month since October of 2020 and industrial production was up 8% in the first quarter, its strongest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our industrial team is executing on its sales programs to accelerate organic growth, and delivered positive sales growth across every major product category and industry served with most up double digits. As mentioned earlier, our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of KDG. While Will is going to go into greater detail in a few moments, I would summarize by saying that we are on plan in generating expected synergies. Wrapping up our industrial review, our strong first quarter results gives us confidence in our growth plans and pricing actions and we enter the second quarter with strong momentum. We expect continued healthy activity levels across the vast majority of our products and industries. Finally, it\u2019s important to add that we have been busy in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. Our focus areas in 2022 include formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy, and establishing reduction targets as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We will provide additional details and report on our progress in these areas in our 2022 sustainability report later this year.  So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will. Will?\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to echo Paul\u2019s comments and thank the global GPC teams for the impressive start to 2022. The teams did a great job during the quarter and built on the strong finish to 2021. As we traveled and visited the global operations during the quarter, the team energy is positive. There\u2019s a strong sense of focus and alignment and it\u2019s encouraging to see the broad base strength across the business. Our discussion centered around performance trends, initiative progress, talent, and finding better ways to serve our customers. Global supply chain and inflation challenges are common topics and all are doing an excellent job to respond. The in-flight strategic initiatives continued to deliver impact. Our foundational priorities are talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Strategic M&A complements our initiatives.  We added to our talent momentum during the quarter. In addition to Bert joining the team, we welcome Jeff England as EVP, Chief Supply Chain Officer of the US Automotive business. Jeff joins us following an impressive career over nearly two decades at Walmart. He will lead end-to-end supply chain execution for us automotive and brings discipline strategic leadership and relevant expertise. We\u2019re excited to have him on the team. During our travels, we had the chance to meet with the Canadian automotive leadership team in person for the first time in two years. As Paul mentioned, the Canadian economy is showing encouraging signs of strength, as it reopens from prolonged lockdowns and our Canadian team is well-positioned with detailed market-level plans to capture the growth. We also traveled to Australia where we visited locations and performed deep dive initiative reviews. Like Canada, this was the first time in over two years, the extended GPC and Australian leadership team was together in person. GPC Asia Pac continues to capture market share with its differentiated customer value propositions, new store rollouts, and unique digital and brand strategies, all of which are delivering winning profitable growth. We look forward to celebrating the 100th year anniversary with the GPC Asia Pac team later this year. In both Australia and Canada, sales effectiveness initiatives focused on market density, data and analytics, and customer loyalty are proving effective.  Our technology initiatives are building momentum. The teams are gaining positive traction in our efforts across B2B digital, inventory store systems, payments, and workforce management platforms. We continue to invest in diverse engineering talent across the technology organization, and evolve our operating approach to leverage common solutions around the globe. Our supply chain initiatives are advancing well. In the quarter we visited with various US automotive DC leadership teams in the mid Atlantic region, where we walked facilities, assessed operational performance, and thanked the teams. Our US automotive distribution facilities are working hard to process strong demand, despite challenging supply chain and labor dynamics. We also spend time with our industrial business and met with the extended Motion leadership team. We reviewed the successes of our fulfillment center and network optimization effort in Florida. The strategy improved service levels, enhances product depth, and reduces duplicative fixed costs. Similarly, while in Australia, we received an encouraging update on the traction of network and automation investments in New Zealand and Victoria. In each example, our supply chain investments improved the customer experience and enhanced operating productivity. Our emerging technology initiatives made progress in the quarter as well. We hosted our first emerging tech supplier council session with various automotive partners to learn from each other and explore opportunities. We executed various targeted inventory strategies to serve current EV market needs, rolled out marketing efforts, added dedicated emerging tech talent, and advanced numerous emerging tech commercial partnership discussions across Europe, Canada, and the US. M&A bolt on execution continues to be active. We remain focused on adding density to existing priority markets entering complementary strategic geographies and/or adding new product expertise or capabilities. The KDG integration and synergy efforts are ahead of plan. The dedicated integration team is executing a disciplined playbook to deliver value. The feedback from teammates, customers, and vendors continues to be extremely positive. The executive leadership functional and field operating structures are already realigned, and the teams are working well together as one motion team. As an example, the team rebranded the combined fluid power offering to Motion fluid power solutions. Based on Motion\u2019s existing vendor relationships, we onboard over 20 new strategic fluid power supplier relationships, which added 2 million SKUs to our offering, ultimately giving our customers more choice, and our vendor partners and sales teams more opportunity to deliver growth. The team also realigned our automation and robotics business under the Motion AI, or Motion Automation Intelligence brand, which now creates a $500 million leading national automation platform. We are really pleased with the early momentum of the integration efforts and are excited about the value creation outlook. In summary, our travels during the quarter reinforce that our initiatives are well defined, and the teams are focused to execute. Our people care about serving our customers, always impressed with their deep expertise and are energized to deliver results.  Before I turn it over to Carol, I\u2019d like to again acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we thank you for all you\u2019ve done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol? \nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Will. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focused on our quarterly adjusted results which exclude the transaction and other costs related to the acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, as outlined in our press release.  Total GPC sales were 5.3 billion in the first quarter, up 830 million or 19% from last year. Our gross margin for the quarter was 34.6%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter last year, primarily driven by the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. These gains were partially offset by slight headwinds from supplier incentives, shifts in business mix, foreign currency and the timing of inflation in certain product categories.  Our total operating and non-operating expenses were 1.4 8 billion, up 18% from 2021 and at 27.9% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales last year. Double digit comp sales growth in the first quarter drove SG&A expense leverage, despite the ongoing inflationary pressures in areas such as wages and freight. Our teams are focused on executing our strategic initiatives to further reduce expenses and drive operational efficiencies.  With our strong sales and improvement in gross margin and SG&A, segment profit was 453 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 8.6%, a 50 basis point increase from last year. Our tax rate was 24.5% compared to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2021. With the increase in rate due to several factors, including the impact of prior year gains on the sale of real estate and geographic shifts in income. First quarter adjusted net income was 266 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.86. This compares to 218 million or $1.50 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 24%; really solid work across our global teams to achieve this strong growth in the first quarter. So turning to our first quarter results by segment. Total automotive revenue was 3.3 billion, up 11% from last year. Segment profit was 265 million, up 12% with profit margin at 8.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from 2021 and up 120 basis points from 2019. Our industrial sales were 2 billion in the quarter, up 34% from 2021. Segment profit of 188 million was up a strong 50% from a year ago and profit margin improved to 9.3%, up 100 basis points from 2021 and up 180 basis points from 2019. This margin improvement reflects the benefits of strong sales growth and strategic initiatives in areas such as category management and pricing. In addition, the industrial team is also advancing their plans to gain further operational efficiencies. Both our automotive and industrial teams are doing a tremendous job of managing through a dynamic environment and delivering margin expansion. Through their steady focus on our strategic priorities, we\u2019ve improved our total segment profit margin by 150 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So now let\u2019s turn our comments to the balance sheet. At March 31, our total accounts receivable was up 18%, including the sale of 200 million in receivables under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our inventory was up 17% or up 9%, excluding KDG, a function of the sales increase and accounts payable increased 16% from 2021, in line with the increase in inventory. Our AP to inventory ratio of 124% was unchanged from December 31 and the prior year.  Our total debt at March 31 is 3.5 billion, up 900 million or 34% from March of last year, driven by the 1 billion in new public debt related to the KDG acquisition. We closed the first quarter with available liquidity of 2 billion and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is two times. This is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and supportive of our investment grade rating.  We generated 399 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which has improved from last year. For the full year we expect cash from operations to be in the 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion range and free cash flow of 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion. We believe our continued strong cash flow and the financial strength and flexibility of our balance sheet support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value creating capital allocation.  Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, capital expenditures totaled 78 million for a broad range of productivity enhancing investments. We also invested 1.4 billion of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth and while KDG represents most of this investment, we also acquired several automotive store groups across North America. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional acquisitions and we remain focused on the successful integration of KDG into Motion. In the first quarter, we also paid 116 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend every year since going public in 1928 and the 10% increase for 2022 represents our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. And as part of our share repurchase program, we used 73 million to purchase 570,000 shares in the first quarter. The company is authorized to repurchase up to 11.3 million additional shares and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. So turning to our current outlook for 2022, we are raising all full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 1.5% to 2% headwind from foreign currency translation, and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business segment, we are guiding to plus 5% to plus 7% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. The new outlook reflects plus 6% to plus 8% comp sales growth, which is up from our previous estimate a plus 5% to plus 7%. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to plus 21% to plus 23%, an increase from our previous outlook of plus 20% to plus 22%. This new outlook includes a plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales increase, which is up from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. On the earning side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.70 to $7.85, which is up 11% to 14% from 2021. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $7.45 to $7.60. So while the operating environment remains very dynamic, we\u2019re encouraged by the strength of our first quarter and the continued momentum in our businesses, as we move forward into the second quarter.  To close, as we previously noted, I will be retiring from GPC at the end of May, so this will be my last earnings call as CFO. It\u2019s been a privilege and an honor to work for such an amazing company over the last 30 years and I fully expect the friendships that I\u2019ve made over the years to last a lifetime. I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made together and I know that the best days for GPC are yet to come. I could not be more excited for Bert Nappier to start as CFO on May 2. Bert and I have been working hand-in-hand over the last two months traveling to meet with all of our business units and our leaders, as well as spending time with our finance and accounting teams. It was also nice to meet with many of you on our recent visit to New York. I personally enjoyed seeing everyone in person for the first time in two years and I know that Bert found that time extremely beneficial. I\u2019m confident that Bert\u2019s transition to CFO will be smooth and seamless and now he looks forward to working with each of you very soon.  Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn it over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Carol, another excellent review of our financial performance and fitting that our results were so strong for your last call as CFO. As a reminder to everyone on the call, Carol has had an incredible 30 year career in GPC, serving in nearly every key financial role before being named CFO in 2013. In her nine years of CFO, her leadership and her positive influence on the company\u2019s success has been immeasurable. She has served on our executive leadership team, our investment committee, our cybersecurity committee, and in addition, she has held leadership positions in everything from supply chain and logistics, to real estate and IT, in addition to her financial responsibilities. She has been a valued partner to me and the entire GPC leadership team as well as to our board, and she\u2019ll be greatly missed by all of us. So thank you, Carol, and best wishes to you, to Mike, and your entire family. So in closing, we\u2019re proud of our progress in the first quarter, and the strong results to start the year, delivering a new sales record, continued margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth, a strengthened balance sheet, and strong cash flow highlight our first quarter performance. At the same time, our teams have done a terrific job is integrating KDG into the Motion business. Looking ahead, the increase in our sales and earnings outlook reflects the confidence in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability, as we build on the positive momentum in our automotive and industrial businesses.  While cognizant of the many uncertainties in the global economy, we believe GPC is well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value creating capital allocation while enhancing shareholder value. We thank you for your interest in GPC and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering strong results.  So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Hi, thank you. Good morning. And Carol, thank you, again, and congratulations. Our questions are around the guidance that you raised for the year. We\u2019ve wondered how much of the guidance increase is due to your strong Q1 performance versus maybe what has changed in the outlook for the rest of the year, versus what you were thinking when you first gave guidance? And just has the contribution from inflation changed meaningfully to influence the comp guide?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, thank you for your comments Kate and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the guidance. So certainly what went into our thinking, the stronger quarter that we had, I mean, really couldn\u2019t be more pleased with both our automotive and industrial teams and the stronger comp sales that they delivered. And so that momentum was continuing on was certainly contemplated in our guidance outlook. And then the inflation number was a bit higher than what we anticipated coming out of Q4, and that was contemplated as well. But really based on what we know now, there\u2019s not a ton of clarity around inflation and you know how volatile that is. But we certainly contemplate it a little bit more on the top line growth and a little bit more on inflation. And, on the earning side, certainly the ability to leverage on that growth and a strong Q1 that we have, we just felt like it was appropriate now to use that range that we have. We certainly hope to do better than that but we thought it was an appropriate range to get right now.\nKate McShane: And just as a follow up question, I think, you know, we\u2019ve seen a bit of a fall off in miles driven given the higher gas prices, but it seems that we still are seeing, as you mentioned, a good degree of momentum in automotive. Can you help reconcile for us why you don\u2019t think miles driven is necessarily having as much of an impact on demand and again, how you see that playing out with the higher gas prices?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, I\u2019ll take a shot at that Kate and good morning, welcome to the call. Look, I think, as you look at our tailwinds in the automotive aftermarket, certainly miles driven is a factor we\u2019ve not and unfortunately we don\u2019t get a whole lot of transparency as to where miles driven is trending currently, it usually trails by a couple of months. But given the high gas prices one would assume it is trailing a bit from last year. But when you look at that tailwinds, you\u2019ve got an incredible pent up demand. People want to travel, airfares are incredibly high, so I think you\u2019re going to see folks traveling more both for vacation but I also think that you\u2019re going to see miles driven pickup with folks returning to the workplace. Even though you\u2019ll see a hybrid workforce, I do believe we\u2019ll see a lift there. Used car prices are at all time highs, lack of new car inventory. All of that I believe is going to continue to bode well for the automotive aftermarket. \nKate McShane: Thank you. \nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. And Carol, I\u2019ll add my voice to the thanks for everything over the years.\nCarol Yancey: Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Melich: I guess I have two questions. One for you, Carolyn, I\u2019d start is what comp now do you think you need the lever? Given the broader cost inflation like you talked about mid-single digits in the top line, what do you need to lever now getting comp?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, look, and again, as we have contemplated, when you look at what we\u2019re contemplating for the full year, moving comps of 6% to 8% for automotive and 5% to 7% for industrial, we were pleased to take those comps, up 100 BPs. We also are going into the year with greater operating margin improvement, again contemplated in our guidance and in part based on the stronger results in Q1. So we are certainly comping just fine at those levels but at the same time, this is an inflationary environment that we\u2019ve never seen before and so we\u2019re being very mindful on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of inflation and our product inflation and our costs. But we do know when we look at our numbers and our cost structure that we still have permanently lowered our cost structure going back to 2019. So the in the range of the 3% to 4%, we certainly can see operating margin improvement there with all the actions that we\u2019ve taken.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then maybe, I don\u2019t know Paul or Will, if you want to take this, you\u2019ve mentioned some pretty interesting initiatives in terms of expanding and accelerating growth. I guess I\u2019d love to follow up particularly on the AfterPay. Could you take us as to how big that is and what that program actually entails for both pros or DIY customers? And then Will you talked about adding the SKUs, which I thought was the 2 million SKUs. I thought that was interesting, just some more color on that.\nWill Stengel: Yeah. So on the AfterPay, it is certainly early days, Greg. It\u2019s not a material part of the business but the trends that we\u2019re seeing in our pilots are very encouraging. It is predominantly DIY today with applications for do it for me in the future. One of the things that we\u2019ve done recently is rolled that out online, and we\u2019re seeing an encouraging trend there. So it\u2019s early days, but something that we\u2019re excited about as it relates to acquiring new customers and driving average order value, which is typically higher than what we\u2019ve seen in our core business.  On the supplier side, you know, I think this was a fundamental thesis that we had, when we acquired KDG, the relationship that\u2019s been the supplier and customer base for that matter in the community that Motion has, with that type of transaction, it created a lot of great productive commercial discussions with all of our vendors. And so we called out the fluid power example as one of them but I would say that the discussions that the Motion team is having with its vendor base now with Kaman as part of the family is incredibly encouraging, including the access to new products, new growth segments, etc. So consistent with what we\u2019ve taught before we bought the business, I am really encouraged to see that initiative taking hold. Just as a reminder, it\u2019s only 100 days in on KDG, so again, early days but encouraging trends in the business.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And in my last one, flow got little stronger in the quarter in North America but DIY is still positive. How does that look as you go into the second quarter, especially given the bizarre comps that you\u2019re seeing, particularly in DIY now?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, I\u2019ll take a shot at that, Greg. You mentioned the DIFM comps so up strong-double digits and we\u2019re seeing it across the entire commercial segment from major accounts to auto care to fleet. We\u2019re seeing it across our entire business. DIY is holding up okay. I mean we\u2019re seeing high single digit. Our strength, Greg, is always going to be on the DIFM side and that\u2019s a good 80% of our overall business. For us to generate high single digit numbers in DIY, add to reflect and I think on all the good work our teams are doing in the stores. And look, with inflation that could very well drive people back into the stores attempting to do more DIY type projects. I don\u2019t think the general population is going to get real proficient at changing out their own brakes, but certainly more basic type projects, car care products, I think, will continue to see a good lift in the back half of the year. So yeah, we\u2019re very, very pleased at the mix and anticipate it continuing through the back half of the year. \nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Good luck. \nPaul Donahue: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nChrisHorvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And congratulations, again, Carol, on your retirements. By the time that you depart, we might have spring in the United States, so good news ahead. Maybe starting on the industrial side of the business, you talked about the acceleration in March in the US -- and sorry, and in the quarter. Can you talk about what industries are you seeing the most acceleration? And, obviously, energy and ag, there\u2019s a lot of optimism around those sub sectors, given all the inflation that\u2019s going on in those industries. Can you remind us how significant that is for you and to what extent are you seeing improvements in those sub sectors?\nPaul Donahue: So as I mentioned in my comments, upfront, Chris, the increases we\u2019re seeing are across the board, and in all the segments that we track, we\u2019re seeing really strong double digit with the exception of two and those two are up mid to high single digit. So you called out oil and gas, we\u2019re seeing huge increases in that segment. Not a huge segment for us but I can tell you, the increase is significant. We\u2019re also seeing good increases, solid increases in segments like aggregate, cement, conveyance logistics products, which really points to the strength and expansion we\u2019re seeing in distribution centers around the country; equipment and machinery, which is our single largest segment, again, really, really strong growth in the quarter. So really, it\u2019s broad based and across almost every segment that that we track.\nChrisHorvers: Got it. And then on the US NAPA business in March, an acceleration is pretty impressive considering we are lapping stimulus from a year ago, and to the point on maybe some late spring impact on DIY. So, can you diagnose maybe what helped that acceleration to the extent that it was pro versus DIY? Was it an acceleration on the inflation front? And then was there much difference in terms of the trend in the quarter between company-operated stores and independence?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, I\u2019ll take the last part first, Chris. Not much difference at all, as we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters between our good solid independent owners and our company stores both performed very, very well in the quarter. And as mentioned, we finished strong we had a record sales month in the month of March, but we were up double digit, January, February and March. And you called weather, Chris; the weather has not really been our friend in Q1, certainly not in April with, as you mentioned, snow storms across the upper Midwest and Northeast. I mean, we\u2019re ready to get into spring and get into the ag business, depends on getting out in the field. So weather has not been a positive for us. DIFM versus DIY, I mentioned in an earlier call, strong, strong double digit growth in our core, which is DIFM and that\u2019s across the entire segment. That\u2019s major accounts, fleet, auto care, really pleased to see the surge in our auto care segment; that\u2019s a great call out for us. But DIY continues to be up high single digit and, again, I think that\u2019s evident of the good work that our folks are doing in our stores with a number of initiatives from improved assortments, enhanced store hours, better training, and better in stock availability, so really broad base across the entire NAPA team are all doing well.\nCarol Yancey: And Chris, I would just comment, everything that Paul just said it really was very insignificant in terms of inflationary impact for March, you\u2019re talking about a point or two, Paul said, mid-single digit inflation, we were certainly a bit higher than that in US automotive, but the bulk of it is just all the market initiatives and the growth and really the inflation impact for March specific is really just a point or so, so not significant.\nChrisHorvers: Got it. Thank you very much. \nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So given the pervasiveness of concern in the investment community about a potential recession in the next 12 to 24 months, and then comparing that to the strength you\u2019ve experienced in your business, is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the leading indicators that you track that give you any pause in your outlook for the remainder of the year, maybe a degree of conservatism baked into that raise outlook, just given the uncertainty around potential recession or economic slowdown?\nPaul Donahue: Look, Liz, great question. And certainly, as excited as we are, about our Q1 performance, and how our teams performed really all of 2021 and throughout Q1. We\u2019ve fully realize the environment we\u2019re operating in could get more challenging in the latter part of the year; not as concerned in the US, I think we\u2019ll be fine, industrial remains strong. And I would tell you that our outlook for the balance of the year, we worked really, really hard, and looked at all the factors and we think our guidance for the balance of the year is very prudent.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. And just one follow-up about international expansion, I mean, you guys have been adding new markets to your addressable market for the last -- for several decades and adding a couple of new markets even every couple of years. So are there still -- is there still some low hanging fruit that you see out there, markets where you haven\u2019t entered that seemed like they would make sense as adjacencies to your current business or new regions to enter that you think have the same types of either vehicle dynamics or on the industrial side have similar economic backgrounds as regions where you\u2019re already operating?\nPaul Donahue: So, Liz, I would mention our latest acquisition of Lausan who\u2019s a market leader in Spain and Portugal. That\u2019ll be our eighth and ninth country that we\u2019ve expanded into in Europe and Lausan is just as you -- or Spain is just as you described, it\u2019s a great adjacency to our current markets, fifth largest market in Europe, 35 million vehicles, average age 11 plus years, it\u2019s very under penetrated. We think we\u2019ve got a real opportunity with a great team on the ground in Spain and Portugal to be a first mover in that part of the world. So that\u2019s an exciting move for us.  As we look at, you mentioned industrial, Liz, look, we are incredibly bullish, as we\u2019ve said in these calls before about our industrial business and I think that was borne out in our big acquisition of Kaman in early January. Still plenty of opportunities for our industrial business and continuing to expand. We\u2019ve got arguably less than 5% market share in the MRO space. We\u2019d love the robotics, the automation business. I could certainly see us continuing to expand in those categories. But I can say the same about all of our businesses, Liz. We have less than 10% market share in every business, in every part of the world that we operate in, including our North American automotive business. So yeah, lots of opportunities going forward and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the balance of the year.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thanks very much. \nPaul Donahue: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question is from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys. \nPaul Donahue: Hey, Bret. \nBret Jordan: And congratulations, Carol, again. \nCarol Yancey: Thank you, Bret. \nBret Jordan: On the 12% comp in the US, did you talk about what\u2019s your feelings around share gain were in that number? How do you see the underlying market in the first quarter? And then did you see anything, I guess, relative to pure price dynamics? Is anything other more or less competitive in the US auto market?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah. Bret, being the first one out of the big four to report, it\u2019s hard to say how the others will line up. We\u2019re very, very pleased with our performance in Q1. And if there is any market share gains, my guess is that it perhaps is coming from some of the smaller regional players. But again, until we see the balance of the big four report out, it\u2019d be hard to pinpoint that exactly. In terms of pricing dynamics, Brat, I\u2019m really pleased to tell you that it remains very rational as the automotive aftermarket has for many, many years. Certainly, we\u2019re seeing price increases across all the major categories. But it has remained very, very rational across the industry.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then a question on Europe, could you talk about the cadence of Europe? And obviously a lot of change in Eastern Europe since late February, but is that showing any impacts in Western European demand dynamic? And then just a housekeeping, you talked about the NAPA brand expansion ongoing there, could you talk about what percentage of European sales are in NAPA branded mix?\nPaul Donahue: Yeah, let me take the first part of your question, Bret, in terms of the cadence, again, we had a very good quarter. Well, we had a very good quarter following up on a very good year in 2021 in Europe. So our total sales up 14%, our comps were up 7% in Q1, so very pleased with the performance. As I mentioned earlier, as good as we feel about Q1, we also fully realize that given all of the factors that are occurring in Europe, it could get more challenging in the final three quarters, but I would tell you that our teams are planning accordingly. And, if there\u2019s one thing that we learned, Bret, during the downturn and the pandemic, our teams are very agile, they can turn very quickly and if we do see a downturn in the business, we\u2019ll be ready to pull all the levers to ensure we deliver on the bottom line.  And then the second part of your question, Brat, regarding the NAPA brand, it\u2019s hard to say exactly, but I would tell you, we\u2019re at a point now it\u2019s less than 10% of our overall European business. We launched initially in the UK, it\u2019s more widespread there. And it\u2019s more expansive across a variety of product categories. We have since launched in the Benelux, Germany, France and we\u2019re kind of taking a product category by product category. So we\u2019ve got tremendous upside and many more opportunities to come in. And ultimately now we will launch the NAPA brand as we expand across Spain and Portugal as well. \nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you. \nPaul Donahue: You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Bret.\nOperator: The next question is from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hey, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I\u2019m sure Carol is ready to enjoy her long delayed vacation. Two questions, one on each segment of the business. First, given continuing supply chain challenges, have you seen any signs that companies are trying to increase their domestic production activity? Obviously, that\u2019d be bullish for Motion, if so, and then on the auto business, just given the amount of inflation that\u2019s flowing through both the economy and your own product costs, Paul, have you seen any resistance at all to the higher price points meaning, any kind of demand destruction even if it\u2019s in a small minor category?\nPaul Donahue: Go ahead, Will. Will will take the first question.\nWill Stengel: I\u2019ll take your first question. Absolutely, we\u2019re seeing that. I would say that discussions with the vendor community are more active than they ever have been on the re-shoring concept. So as you alluded to, that\u2019s incredibly bullish for the Motion business over the medium term. I think the global supply chain and the complexities and some of the challenges that everybody\u2019s been working through over the last couple years make it very logical for that manufacturing activity to come back to North America. So we\u2019re bullish about it and we\u2019ll seize that opportunity as it develops.\nPaul Donahue: And then related to your second question, Scott, on automotive, and the higher price points are we seeing consumers trade down; we didn\u2019t see much of it in Q1, I think as evidenced by our strong 12% comp increase, it was strong across just about every product category. But I would tell you with our good better breath -- best strategy we\u2019re well prepared, if we do see consumers begin to trade down to the value lines and we\u2019ve seen that in the past when times get tough, they will trade down. But I would tell you, we did not see much of that in Q1.\nScot Ciccarelli: Excellent. Thanks, guys. \nPaul Donahue: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Yep. Thanks so much, Carol. I have my congratulations and congrats on the first quarter, guys, on the results. \nCarol Yancey: Thank you.\nDaniel Imbro: I wanted to start on the on the industrial piece. Growth was robust, Paul, and with it came some margin leverage. Are you able to disaggregate out of the 1Q margin leverage how much was from any vendor volume rebates versus how much was core sustainable cost removal, just as we model headline growth slowing over time, trying to see how much of that maybe the vendor rebates go away to the back half of this year into next year. Thanks.\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, so on the industrial side, again, the Motion comps were 16% in the quarter, and that is just tremendous operating results. And when you get that kind of comp growth, the leverage on SG&A was extremely impressive. And then on the gross margin side, they\u2019ve done a tremendous job. I mean, they\u2019ve got a long track record of initiatives on the gross margin side, both pricing and category management. And with looking at their improvement in their operating margin, and again, the strong 100 BPs, that\u2019s coming about equally from gross margin and SG&A. The vendor incentives, it certainly is moving in line with what the comps are but it\u2019s incremental dollars, but it\u2019s not necessarily giving us the bump on the rate. So really just strong operating, both on gross margin initiatives on the leverage on the SG&A, and, again, just a tremendous job by the industrial teams. And we certainly are pleased, we don\u2019t have any reason to suspect that that doesn\u2019t continue as we look ahead, because we\u2019ve got full year operating margin implied for them as we look ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. And then maybe one for Will, as I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about bringing in some external talent to lead the supply chain, kind of optimize that. I\u2019m curious as to what drove that decision? Are there particular inefficiencies that you guys were really struggling to address on the supply chain or what made you or why is now the right time to accelerate that investment with external talent you brought in? Thanks. \nWill Stengel: Well, yeah, listen, we\u2019re always looking to add great talent and expertise to the organization. And I would say, we\u2019ve been pretty clear that supply chain technology, our foundational priorities around those elements are clear and talent helps us get there, so nothing to read into it other than we\u2019re adding great folks to the team, and we\u2019re looking forward to build on our momentum.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Daniel.\nOperator: We have time for one more question from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Let me add my congratulations to Carol. I just have a follow up question for you. You talked about the rational pricing environments in the US auto segment. But have you seen any indication of relative price investments from any of your peers who have talked about doing that in the commercial side?\nPaul Donahue: We have not, Seth, and look we\u2019re all attuned to that, given the discussions of a couple of months ago, the team here, Will and I and Carol, and Bert, we spent half a day with our US automotive team, the entire leadership team. And trust me, that was a focal point for us. And I can assure you that we\u2019re not seeing it out there. Might have come here in the second half of the year, perhaps, but we certainly didn\u2019t see it in Q1. \nSeth Basham: Got it. Okay, helpful. And one last follow up, regarding KDG integration, did you see any margin accretion in the industrial segment for addition of that business this quarter or was the margin improvement driven by the other factors that you mentioned?\nCarol Yancey: Yeah, look, we\u2019re going to stay pretty consistent what we talked about at our February call, and also in December with KDG. We certainly -- it\u2019s not -- the contribution of the operating margin improvement was really coming from the core Motion business. Having said that, really pleased with the early execution of the integration and what we\u2019re seeing there is we get to the fully synergize model, it is definitely accretive to the industrial margins but we\u2019re still a bit early on that. So again, the strong comp growth is really what drove the 100 basis point proven and operating margin. But again, KDG performed well in the quarter, they had a similar grid quarter. The teams are really integrated. We spent some time with them. So as we look ahead, we know that we\u2019re going to be at our targets that we talked about, and hopefully be a bit early on the synergies.\nSeth Basham: Wonderful, thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Seth.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nCarol Yancey: We\u2019d like to thank all of you for participating in our Q1 conference call. We appreciate your support. And personally, I appreciate all of your support and your kind remarks today. And the company looks forward to discussing the Q2 results with you in July. Thanks again.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Paul's comments and thank the global GPC teams for the impressive start to 2022. The teams did a great job during the quarter and built on the strong finish to 2021. As we traveled and visited the global operations during the quarter, the team energy is positive. There's a strong sense of focus and alignment and it's encouraging to see the broad base strength across the business. Our discussion centered around performance trends, initiative progress, talent, and finding better ways to serve our customers. Global supply chain and inflation challenges are common topics and all are doing an excellent job to respond. The in-flight strategic initiatives continued to deliver impact. Our foundational priorities are talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, including data and digital, supply chain and emerging technologies. Strategic M&A complements our initiatives.  We added to our talent momentum during the quarter. In addition to Bert joining the team, we welcome Jeff England as EVP, Chief Supply Chain Officer of the US Automotive business. Jeff joins us following an impressive career over nearly two decades at Walmart. He will lead end-to-end supply chain execution for us automotive and brings discipline strategic leadership and relevant expertise. We're excited to have him on the team. During our travels, we had the chance to meet with the Canadian automotive leadership team in person for the first time in two years. As Paul mentioned, the Canadian economy is showing encouraging signs of strength, as it reopens from prolonged lockdowns and our Canadian team is well-positioned with detailed market-level plans to capture the growth. We also traveled to Australia where we visited locations and performed deep dive initiative reviews. Like Canada, this was the first time in over two years, the extended GPC and Australian leadership team was together in person. GPC Asia Pac continues to capture market share with its differentiated customer value propositions, new store rollouts, and unique digital and brand strategies, all of which are delivering winning profitable growth. We look forward to celebrating the 100th year anniversary with the GPC Asia Pac team later this year. In both Australia and Canada, sales effectiveness initiatives focused on market density, data and analytics, and customer loyalty are proving effective.  Our technology initiatives are building momentum. The teams are gaining positive traction in our efforts across B2B digital, inventory store systems, payments, and workforce management platforms. We continue to invest in diverse engineering talent across the technology organization, and evolve our operating approach to leverage common solutions around the globe. Our supply chain initiatives are advancing well. In the quarter we visited with various US automotive DC leadership teams in the mid Atlantic region, where we walked facilities, assessed operational performance, and thanked the teams. Our US automotive distribution facilities are working hard to process strong demand, despite challenging supply chain and labor dynamics. We also spend time with our industrial business and met with the extended Motion leadership team. We reviewed the successes of our fulfillment center and network optimization effort in Florida. The strategy improved service levels, enhances product depth, and reduces duplicative fixed costs. Similarly, while in Australia, we received an encouraging update on the traction of network and automation investments in New Zealand and Victoria. In each example, our supply chain investments improved the customer experience and enhanced operating productivity. Our emerging technology initiatives made progress in the quarter as well. We hosted our first emerging tech supplier council session with various automotive partners to learn from each other and explore opportunities. We executed various targeted inventory strategies to serve current EV market needs, rolled out marketing efforts, added dedicated emerging tech talent, and advanced numerous emerging tech commercial partnership discussions across Europe, Canada, and the US. M&A bolt on execution continues to be active. We remain focused on adding density to existing priority markets entering complementary strategic geographies and/or adding new product expertise or capabilities. The KDG integration and synergy efforts are ahead of plan. The dedicated integration team is executing a disciplined playbook to deliver value. The feedback from teammates, customers, and vendors continues to be extremely positive. The executive leadership functional and field operating structures are already realigned, and the teams are working well together as one motion team. As an example, the team rebranded the combined fluid power offering to Motion fluid power solutions. Based on Motion's existing vendor relationships, we onboard over 20 new strategic fluid power supplier relationships, which added 2 million SKUs to our offering, ultimately giving our customers more choice, and our vendor partners and sales teams more opportunity to deliver growth. The team also realigned our automation and robotics business under the Motion AI, or Motion Automation Intelligence brand, which now creates a $500 million leading national automation platform. We are really pleased with the early momentum of the integration efforts and are excited about the value creation outlook. In summary, our travels during the quarter reinforce that our initiatives are well defined, and the teams are focused to execute. Our people care about serving our customers, always impressed with their deep expertise and are energized to deliver results.  Before I turn it over to Carol, I'd like to again acknowledge her amazing career at GPC. Carol, on behalf of the extended team, we thank you for all you've done for GPC and for all our GPC stakeholders over the years.  With that, I'll turn it over to Carol to detail the financials. Carol? Yeah. So on the AfterPay, it is certainly early days, Greg. It's not a material part of the business but the trends that we're seeing in our pilots are very encouraging. It is predominantly DIY today with applications for do it for me in the future. One of the things that we've done recently is rolled that out online, and we're seeing an encouraging trend there. So it's early days, but something that we're excited about as it relates to acquiring new customers and driving average order value, which is typically higher than what we've seen in our core business.

And so we called out the fluid power example as one of them but I would say that the discussions that the Motion team is having with its vendor base now with Kaman as part of the family is incredibly encouraging, including the access to new products, new growth segments, etc. So consistent with what we've taught before we bought the business, I am really encouraged to see that initiative taking hold. Just as a reminder, it's only 100 days in on KDG, so again, early days but encouraging trends in the business. I'll take your first question. Absolutely, we're seeing that. I would say that discussions with the vendor community are more active than they ever have been on the re-shoring concept. So as you alluded to, that's incredibly bullish for the Motion business over the medium term. I think the global supply chain and the complexities and some of the challenges that everybody's been working through over the last couple years make it very logical for that manufacturing activity to come back to North America. So we're bullish about it and we'll seize that opportunity as it develops. Well, yeah, listen, we're always looking to add great talent and expertise to the organization. And I would say, we've been pretty clear that supply chain technology, our foundational priorities around those elements are clear and talent helps us get there, so nothing to read into it other than we're adding great folks to the team, and we're looking forward to build on our momentum."

As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focused on our quarterly adjusted results which exclude the transaction and other costs related to the acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group, as outlined in our press release.  Total GPC sales were 5.3 billion in the first quarter, up 830 million or 19% from last year. Our gross margin for the quarter was 34.6%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter last year, primarily driven by the positive impact of strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing. These gains were partially offset by slight headwinds from supplier incentives, shifts in business mix, foreign currency and the timing of inflation in certain product categories.  Our total operating and non-operating expenses were 1.4 8 billion, up 18% from 2021 and at 27.9% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales last year. Double digit comp sales growth in the first quarter drove SG&A expense leverage, despite the ongoing inflationary pressures in areas such as wages and freight. Our teams are focused on executing our strategic initiatives to further reduce expenses and drive operational efficiencies.  With our strong sales and improvement in gross margin and SG&A, segment profit was 453 million, up 25%, and our segment profit margin was 8.6%, a 50 basis point increase from last year. Our tax rate was 24.5% compared to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2021. With the increase in rate due to several factors, including the impact of prior year gains on the sale of real estate and geographic shifts in income. First quarter adjusted net income was 266 million with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.86. This compares to 218 million or $1.50 per adjusted diluted share in the prior year, an increase of 24%; really solid work across our global teams to achieve this strong growth in the first quarter. So turning to our first quarter results by segment. Total automotive revenue was 3.3 billion, up 11% from last year. Segment profit was 265 million, up 12% with profit margin at 8.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from 2021 and up 120 basis points from 2019. Our industrial sales were 2 billion in the quarter, up 34% from 2021. Segment profit of 188 million was up a strong 50% from a year ago and profit margin improved to 9.3%, up 100 basis points from 2021 and up 180 basis points from 2019. This margin improvement reflects the benefits of strong sales growth and strategic initiatives in areas such as category management and pricing. In addition, the industrial team is also advancing their plans to gain further operational efficiencies. Both our automotive and industrial teams are doing a tremendous job of managing through a dynamic environment and delivering margin expansion. Through their steady focus on our strategic priorities, we've improved our total segment profit margin by 150 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. So now let's turn our comments to the balance sheet. At March 31, our total accounts receivable was up 18%, including the sale of 200 million in receivables under an accounts receivable sales agreement. Our inventory was up 17% or up 9%, excluding KDG, a function of the sales increase and accounts payable increased 16% from 2021, in line with the increase in inventory. Our AP to inventory ratio of 124% was unchanged from December 31 and the prior year.  Our total debt at March 31 is 3.5 billion, up 900 million or 34% from March of last year, driven by the 1 billion in new public debt related to the KDG acquisition. We closed the first quarter with available liquidity of 2 billion and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is two times. This is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times and supportive of our investment grade rating.  We generated 399 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which has improved from last year. For the full year we expect cash from operations to be in the 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion range and free cash flow of 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion. We believe our continued strong cash flow and the financial strength and flexibility of our balance sheet support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value creating capital allocation.  Our key priorities for cash remain the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, capital expenditures totaled 78 million for a broad range of productivity enhancing investments. We also invested 1.4 billion of cash for strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth and while KDG represents most of this investment, we also acquired several automotive store groups across North America. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of additional acquisitions and we remain focused on the successful integration of KDG into Motion. In the first quarter, we also paid 116 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. The company has paid a cash dividend every year since going public in 1928 and the 10% increase for 2022 represents our 66th consecutive annual increase in the dividend. And as part of our share repurchase program, we used 73 million to purchase 570,000 shares in the first quarter. The company is authorized to repurchase up to 11.3 million additional shares and we expect to remain active in this program in the quarters ahead. So turning to our current outlook for 2022, we are raising all full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 17. We expect total sales for 2022 to be in the range of plus 10% to plus 12%, an increase from plus 9% to plus 11%. These growth rates include an estimated 1.5% to 2% headwind from foreign currency translation, and exclude the benefit of any future acquisitions. By business segment, we are guiding to plus 5% to plus 7% total sales growth for the automotive segment, an increase from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. The new outlook reflects plus 6% to plus 8% comp sales growth, which is up from our previous estimate a plus 5% to plus 7%. For the industrial segment, we are updating our total sales outlook to plus 21% to plus 23%, an increase from our previous outlook of plus 20% to plus 22%. This new outlook includes a plus 5% to plus 7% comp sales increase, which is up from the plus 4% to plus 6% previously. On the earning side, we are raising our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $7.70 to $7.85, which is up 11% to 14% from 2021. This represents an increase from our previous guidance of $7.45 to $7.60. So while the operating environment remains very dynamic, we're encouraged by the strength of our first quarter and the continued momentum in our businesses, as we move forward into the second quarter.  To close, as we previously noted, I will be retiring from GPC at the end of May, so this will be my last earnings call as CFO. It's been a privilege and an honor to work for such an amazing company over the last 30 years and I fully expect the friendships that I've made over the years to last a lifetime. I'm proud of the progress we've made together and I know that the best days for GPC are yet to come. I could not be more excited for Bert Nappier to start as CFO on May 2. Bert and I have been working hand-in-hand over the last two months traveling to meet with all of our business units and our leaders, as well as spending time with our finance and accounting teams. It was also nice to meet with many of you on our recent visit to New York. I personally enjoyed seeing everyone in person for the first time in two years and I know that Bert found that time extremely beneficial. I'm confident that Bert's transition to CFO will be smooth and seamless and now he looks forward to working with each of you very soon.  Thank you and I'll now turn it over to Paul. Yeah, thank you for your comments Kate and I'll talk a little bit about the guidance. So certainly what went into our thinking, the stronger quarter that we had, I mean, really couldn't be more pleased with both our automotive and industrial teams and the stronger comp sales that they delivered. And so that momentum was continuing on was certainly contemplated in our guidance outlook. And then the inflation number was a bit higher than what we anticipated coming out of Q4, and that was contemplated as well. But really based on what we know now, there's not a ton of clarity around inflation and you know how volatile that is. But we certainly contemplate it a little bit more on the top line growth and a little bit more on inflation. And, on the earning side, certainly the ability to leverage on that growth and a strong Q1 that we have, we just felt like it was appropriate now to use that range that we have. We certainly hope to do better than that but we thought it was an appropriate range to get right now. Thanks, Greg. Yeah, look, and again, as we have contemplated, when you look at what we're contemplating for the full year, moving comps of 6% to 8% for automotive and 5% to 7% for industrial, we were pleased to take those comps, up 100 BPs. We also are going into the year with greater operating margin improvement, again contemplated in our guidance and in part based on the stronger results in Q1. So we are certainly comping just fine at those levels but at the same time, this is an inflationary environment that we've never seen before and so we're being very mindful on what we're seeing in terms of inflation and our product inflation and our costs. But we do know when we look at our numbers and our cost structure that we still have permanently lowered our cost structure going back to 2019. So the in the range of the 3% to 4%, we certainly can see operating margin improvement there with all the actions that we've taken. And Chris, I would just comment, everything that Paul just said it really was very insignificant in terms of inflationary impact for March, you're talking about a point or two, Paul said, mid-single digit inflation, we were certainly a bit higher than that in US automotive, but the bulk of it is just all the market initiatives and the growth and really the inflation impact for March specific is really just a point or so, so not significant. Thank you, Bret. Thank you. Yeah, so on the industrial side, again, the Motion comps were 16% in the quarter, and that is just tremendous operating results. And when you get that kind of comp growth, the leverage on SG&A was extremely impressive. And then on the gross margin side, they've done a tremendous job. I mean, they've got a long track record of initiatives on the gross margin side, both pricing and category management. And with looking at their improvement in their operating margin, and again, the strong 100 BPs, that's coming about equally from gross margin and SG&A. The vendor incentives, it certainly is moving in line with what the comps are but it's incremental dollars, but it's not necessarily giving us the bump on the rate. So really just strong operating, both on gross margin initiatives on the leverage on the SG&A, and, again, just a tremendous job by the industrial teams. And we certainly are pleased, we don't have any reason to suspect that that doesn't continue as we look ahead, because we've got full year operating margin implied for them as we look ahead. Yeah, look, we're going to stay pretty consistent what we talked about at our February call, and also in December with KDG. We certainly -- it's not -- the contribution of the operating margin improvement was really coming from the core Motion business. Having said that, really pleased with the early execution of the integration and what we're seeing there is we get to the fully synergize model, it is definitely accretive to the industrial margins but we're still a bit early on that. So again, the strong comp growth is really what drove the 100 basis point proven and operating margin. But again, KDG performed well in the quarter, they had a similar grid quarter. The teams are really integrated. We spent some time with them. So as we look ahead, we know that we're going to be at our targets that we talked about, and hopefully be a bit early on the synergies. We'd like to thank all of you for participating in our Q1 conference call. We appreciate your support. And personally, I appreciate all of your support and your kind remarks today. And the company looks forward to discussing the Q2 results with you in July. Thanks again."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As Sid mentioned, we're happy to have Bert Nappier on the call with us today. Bert joined us on February 28 as CFO-Elect and has been working side by side with Carol to ensure a smooth transition in this key role. Turning to the first quarter, we were pleased with the continued strength and our results to start the year and we're proud of the great work by all of our 52,000 GPC teammates who are at the core of our success. A few highlights in the quarter include new quarterly sales records for GPC and our automotive and industrial segment, segment margin expansion of 50 basis points, strong double-digit EPS growth and a strengthened balance sheet and strong cash flow. The GPC team is focused on key strategic priorities to sustain accelerated sales growth, improved gross margins and enhanced operational efficiencies in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures at levels we haven't seen in 40 plus years. We also executed on our acquisition strategy and our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of Kaman Distribution Group. And with the addition of Lausan, which we announced last week, we've expanded our automotive footprint in Europe, with the entry into key markets in Spain and Portugal, Europe's fifth largest market. For the first quarter, total sales were 5.3 billion, a 19% increase from last year. We delivered our 18th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and our teams drove cost initiatives to enhance productivity and offset inflationary pressures. All in adjusted earnings per share were up 24%, representing our seventh straight quarter of double digit EPS growth. Total sales for global automotive were 3.3 billion for the quarter, and 11% increase from 2021 and representing 62% of total company's sales. On a comp basis, sales were up 10% driven by low double digit comps in the US and Canada and high single digit sales comps in Europe and Australasia. This sales cadence through the quarter was relatively steady with our strongest performance coming in the month of March with our team's posting a 30 plus percent increase on a two years stack. Our pricing actions have contributed positively to sales. And we have maintained our gross margins despite mid-single digit inflation for the quarter. As we look ahead, we believe the sales environment continues to support our pricing actions and we expect current levels of inflation to continue through at least the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, our strongest Q1 comps were in North America. In Canada, the continued reopening of the economy drove strong demand, and a 14% increase in total sales, with comp sales up 13%. In the US, total sales were up 14.5%, with comp sales up 12% from last year. These results reflect strengthening trends on our two year stacks for both markets. In the US, sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive, with double-digit commercial sales growth outperforming DIY. In addition, ticket and traffic counts were both positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Sales were strong across a number of product categories such as brakes, heating and cooling, and chassis. DIY sales continue to trend well above historical growth rates with enhanced in-store merchandising, improved product assortment, and our digital initiatives all driving solid growth. NAPA online continues to be our fastest growing sales channel, up nearly 50% from last year. In addition, our AfterPay payments service, which offers existing and new customers buy now pay later option has been well received by consumers and is driving higher basket sizes. We have launched AfterPay in other global markets and we are excited to see the growth generated from this new service, both online and in-store. The strength in commercial sales was driven by double-digit growth across the majority of our customer segment. Sales to our major account partners, NAPA auto care centers, fleet, government, and other wholesale customers were all strong, driven by the continued strength and demand for commercial repairs and maintenance. Our sales teams were also effective in attracting new business with national and regional accounts, fleets and auto care accounts, so an outstanding job by our teams and strong results across all our commercial accounts. Furthering our commitment to the commercial segment, we are excited to return to the classroom with in-person training for our auto technicians across the industry. NAPA Auto Tech provides industry leading virtual online and classroom training programs as a value added service for over 50,000 technicians each year. We are particularly proud to have more than 2000 new techs in our accredited training program. Our European operations also had a strong start to the year with total sales up 14% and comp sales up 7% from last year. These results reflect solid growth across each of our seven European markets, and are especially impressive given the headwinds of a mild winter across Europe. Our AAG team continues to drive share gains through key account expansion and the continued rollout of NAPA branded products. As announced last week, we expanded our presence into key markets in Spain and Portugal with the addition of Lausan. Lausan is a leading distributor of automotive aftermarket parts based in Bilbao, Spain, with a nationwide footprint including one national distribution center, and nine regional DC servicing over 14,000 customer partners and key account. With our entree into Spain and Portugal, both highly fragmented markets, we expect to further strengthen Lausan's market-leading position by capitalizing on our European scale and purchasing expertise as well as leveraging our NAPA brand. We welcome the Lausan team to the GPC family and we are excited to work together to maximize the growth opportunities in our European business. In our Asia Pac business, total sales were up 10% from 2021 with comp sales up 8% and the strongest two years sales tax across our automotive operations. This represents a terrific start to 2022, despite the headwinds posed by the COVID outbreak and severe flooding during the quarter. Both commercial and retail sales continue to perform well with growth for the Repco and NAPA brands driven by the increased demand and share gains from accelerated digital strategies and store expansion. With 2022 representing Repco's 100th anniversary, it's only fitting the Asia Pac team would have a standout year. So now let's discuss the Global Industrial segment. Total sales for this group were 2 billion for the quarter, a 34% increase from last year and representing 38% of total GPC sales. On a comp basis, which excludes KDG, sales were up 16%, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit comps, driven primarily by the strong growth in our North American business. The sales cadence strengthened throughout the quarter with March being the strongest of the three months. The strong sales momentum in our industrial business reflects the benefits of our many growth initiatives and continued strength of the industrial economy, as evidenced by the PMI and industrial production indices. PMI has consistently held at expansionary levels of 57 or above every month since October of 2020 and industrial production was up 8% in the first quarter, its strongest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our industrial team is executing on its sales programs to accelerate organic growth, and delivered positive sales growth across every major product category and industry served with most up double digits. As mentioned earlier, our industrial team made excellent progress on the integration of KDG. While Will is going to go into greater detail in a few moments, I would summarize by saying that we are on plan in generating expected synergies. Wrapping up our industrial review, our strong first quarter results gives us confidence in our growth plans and pricing actions and we enter the second quarter with strong momentum. We expect continued healthy activity levels across the vast majority of our products and industries. Finally, it's important to add that we have been busy in 2022 building on our commitment to responsible ESG business practices. Our focus areas in 2022 include formalizing our carbon emission reduction strategy, and establishing reduction targets as well as driving continued progress in DE&I. We will provide additional details and report on our progress in these areas in our 2022 sustainability report later this year.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Thank you, Carol, another excellent review of our financial performance and fitting that our results were so strong for your last call as CFO. As a reminder to everyone on the call, Carol has had an incredible 30 year career in GPC, serving in nearly every key financial role before being named CFO in 2013. In her nine years of CFO, her leadership and her positive influence on the company's success has been immeasurable. She has served on our executive leadership team, our investment committee, our cybersecurity committee, and in addition, she has held leadership positions in everything from supply chain and logistics, to real estate and IT, in addition to her financial responsibilities. She has been a valued partner to me and the entire GPC leadership team as well as to our board, and she'll be greatly missed by all of us. So thank you, Carol, and best wishes to you, to Mike, and your entire family. So in closing, we're proud of our progress in the first quarter, and the strong results to start the year, delivering a new sales record, continued margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth, a strengthened balance sheet, and strong cash flow highlight our first quarter performance. At the same time, our teams have done a terrific job is integrating KDG into the Motion business. Looking ahead, the increase in our sales and earnings outlook reflects the confidence in our plans for accelerated growth and profitability, as we build on the positive momentum in our automotive and industrial businesses.  While cognizant of the many uncertainties in the global economy, we believe GPC is well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to support our growth plans and provide for disciplined value creating capital allocation while enhancing shareholder value. We thank you for your interest in GPC and we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers and delivering strong results.  So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Yeah, I'll take a shot at that Kate and good morning, welcome to the call. Look, I think, as you look at our tailwinds in the automotive aftermarket, certainly miles driven is a factor we've not and unfortunately we don't get a whole lot of transparency as to where miles driven is trending currently, it usually trails by a couple of months. But given the high gas prices one would assume it is trailing a bit from last year. But when you look at that tailwinds, you've got an incredible pent up demand. People want to travel, airfares are incredibly high, so I think you're going to see folks traveling more both for vacation but I also think that you're going to see miles driven pickup with folks returning to the workplace. Even though you'll see a hybrid workforce, I do believe we'll see a lift there. Used car prices are at all time highs, lack of new car inventory. All of that I believe is going to continue to bode well for the automotive aftermarket. Thank you. Yeah, I'll take a shot at that, Greg. You mentioned the DIFM comps so up strong-double digits and we're seeing it across the entire commercial segment from major accounts to auto care to fleet. We're seeing it across our entire business. DIY is holding up okay. I mean we're seeing high single digit. Our strength, Greg, is always going to be on the DIFM side and that's a good 80% of our overall business. For us to generate high single digit numbers in DIY, add to reflect and I think on all the good work our teams are doing in the stores. And look, with inflation that could very well drive people back into the stores attempting to do more DIY type projects. I don't think the general population is going to get real proficient at changing out their own brakes, but certainly more basic type projects, car care products, I think, will continue to see a good lift in the back half of the year. So yeah, we're very, very pleased at the mix and anticipate it continuing through the back half of the year. Thank you. So as I mentioned in my comments, upfront, Chris, the increases we're seeing are across the board, and in all the segments that we track, we're seeing really strong double digit with the exception of two and those two are up mid to high single digit. So you called out oil and gas, we're seeing huge increases in that segment. Not a huge segment for us but I can tell you, the increase is significant. We're also seeing good increases, solid increases in segments like aggregate, cement, conveyance logistics products, which really points to the strength and expansion we're seeing in distribution centers around the country; equipment and machinery, which is our single largest segment, again, really, really strong growth in the quarter. So really, it's broad based and across almost every segment that that we track. Yeah, I'll take the last part first, Chris. Not much difference at all, as we've seen in recent quarters between our good solid independent owners and our company stores both performed very, very well in the quarter. And as mentioned, we finished strong we had a record sales month in the month of March, but we were up double digit, January, February and March. And you called weather, Chris; the weather has not really been our friend in Q1, certainly not in April with, as you mentioned, snow storms across the upper Midwest and Northeast. I mean, we're ready to get into spring and get into the ag business, depends on getting out in the field. So weather has not been a positive for us. DIFM versus DIY, I mentioned in an earlier call, strong, strong double digit growth in our core, which is DIFM and that's across the entire segment. That's major accounts, fleet, auto care, really pleased to see the surge in our auto care segment; that's a great call out for us. But DIY continues to be up high single digit and, again, I think that's evident of the good work that our folks are doing in our stores with a number of initiatives from improved assortments, enhanced store hours, better training, and better in stock availability, so really broad base across the entire NAPA team are all doing well. Thanks, Chris. Look, Liz, great question. And certainly, as excited as we are, about our Q1 performance, and how our teams performed really all of 2021 and throughout Q1. We've fully realize the environment we're operating in could get more challenging in the latter part of the year; not as concerned in the US, I think we'll be fine, industrial remains strong. And I would tell you that our outlook for the balance of the year, we worked really, really hard, and looked at all the factors and we think our guidance for the balance of the year is very prudent. So, Liz, I would mention our latest acquisition of Lausan who's a market leader in Spain and Portugal. That'll be our eighth and ninth country that we've expanded into in Europe and Lausan is just as you -- or Spain is just as you described, it's a great adjacency to our current markets, fifth largest market in Europe, 35 million vehicles, average age 11 plus years, it's very under penetrated. We think we've got a real opportunity with a great team on the ground in Spain and Portugal to be a first mover in that part of the world. So that's an exciting move for us.  As we look at, you mentioned industrial, Liz, look, we are incredibly bullish, as we've said in these calls before about our industrial business and I think that was borne out in our big acquisition of Kaman in early January. Still plenty of opportunities for our industrial business and continuing to expand. We've got arguably less than 5% market share in the MRO space. We'd love the robotics, the automation business. I could certainly see us continuing to expand in those categories. But I can say the same about all of our businesses, Liz. We have less than 10% market share in every business, in every part of the world that we operate in, including our North American automotive business. So yeah, lots of opportunities going forward and we're cautiously optimistic about the balance of the year. Thank you. Hey, Bret. Yeah. Bret, being the first one out of the big four to report, it's hard to say how the others will line up. We're very, very pleased with our performance in Q1. And if there is any market share gains, my guess is that it perhaps is coming from some of the smaller regional players. But again, until we see the balance of the big four report out, it'd be hard to pinpoint that exactly. In terms of pricing dynamics, Brat, I'm really pleased to tell you that it remains very rational as the automotive aftermarket has for many, many years. Certainly, we're seeing price increases across all the major categories. But it has remained very, very rational across the industry. Yeah, let me take the first part of your question, Bret, in terms of the cadence, again, we had a very good quarter. Well, we had a very good quarter following up on a very good year in 2021 in Europe. So our total sales up 14%, our comps were up 7% in Q1, so very pleased with the performance. As I mentioned earlier, as good as we feel about Q1, we also fully realize that given all of the factors that are occurring in Europe, it could get more challenging in the final three quarters, but I would tell you that our teams are planning accordingly. And, if there's one thing that we learned, Bret, during the downturn and the pandemic, our teams are very agile, they can turn very quickly and if we do see a downturn in the business, we'll be ready to pull all the levers to ensure we deliver on the bottom line.  And then the second part of your question, Brat, regarding the NAPA brand, it's hard to say exactly, but I would tell you, we're at a point now it's less than 10% of our overall European business. We launched initially in the UK, it's more widespread there. And it's more expansive across a variety of product categories. We have since launched in the Benelux, Germany, France and we're kind of taking a product category by product category. So we've got tremendous upside and many more opportunities to come in. And ultimately now we will launch the NAPA brand as we expand across Spain and Portugal as well. You're welcome. Thank you, Bret. Go ahead, Will. Will will take the first question. And then related to your second question, Scott, on automotive, and the higher price points are we seeing consumers trade down; we didn't see much of it in Q1, I think as evidenced by our strong 12% comp increase, it was strong across just about every product category. But I would tell you with our good better breath -- best strategy we're well prepared, if we do see consumers begin to trade down to the value lines and we've seen that in the past when times get tough, they will trade down. But I would tell you, we did not see much of that in Q1. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Daniel. We have not, Seth, and look we're all attuned to that, given the discussions of a couple of months ago, the team here, Will and I and Carol, and Bert, we spent half a day with our US automotive team, the entire leadership team. And trust me, that was a focal point for us. And I can assure you that we're not seeing it out there. Might have come here in the second half of the year, perhaps, but we certainly didn't see it in Q1. Thank you, Seth."

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during today's call.  With that, let me turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company delivered on our financial commitments in 2023 and finished the year with a solid fourth quarter. Will and Bert will cover our results in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights.  During 2023, total GPC sales topped $23 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the prior year and in line with our expectations. We improved our total company segment profit margins by 50 basis points to nearly double digits, and we had our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. And notably, we returned $788 million to our shareholders this year and today, we announced that our Board approved a 68th consecutive annual increase to the dividend.  Our teams around the globe delivered a strong performance while remaining focused on our long-term strategic initiatives to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 60,000 GPC teammates across the world for their dedication and hard work. Our fourth quarter and full year results again demonstrate the value of our complementary business mix paired with our geographic diversity. At our Investor Day back in March of 2023, we showcased our strategic initiatives and announced long-term financial targets for the first time in our history, all focused on delivering for our customers and delivering shareholder value. Clearly, this past year had its share of challenges and opportunities, but our performance in 2023 was a good start to achieve our three-year goals highlighted by the following. Our Motion team completed the integration of Kaman Distribution Group, and we exceeded our synergy target a full year ahead of plan. As an integrated business, Motion is a clear leader in their space, providing industrial aftermarket solutions with a compelling value proposition to more than 200,000 customers around the world.  In addition, during 2023, Motion continued to roll out their fulfillment center strategy, which is driving cost efficiencies, inventory productivity and improved customer service levels. During the fourth quarter, I had a chance to visit our fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida, and I can't say enough positive things about the team and their dedication to serving our customers. We're excited about the rollout of these facilities in 2024 and 2025.  Within Automotive, our International Automotive businesses outperformed our expectations in 2023. Our European team continues to expand their presence and gained market share through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. In 2023, we expanded our presence in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park with the acquisition of Gaudi, securing our position as the leader in this strategic market. And finally, the rollout of NAPA branded product in the European market has continued to surpass our expectations, a testament to the strength of the NAPA brand. In Australasia, our team is profitably growing market share with their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth on top of industry-leading sales growth. Our supply chain investments in the region have improved the customer experience while driving productivity in our business. In North America, while results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives and continue to make solid progress. We've undertaken a comprehensive review of the NAPA business to identify key issues, and we have taken action to improve the performance at NAPA. We are confident we are focused on the right initiatives to positively impact our performance in the quarters ahead. These initiatives, along with plans for long-term investments, were rolled out to our field leadership teams and across our independent owner group in December. The teams' competitive drive and energy were on full display, and we know that the best days for NAPA are in front of us.  And finally, as part of our long-term growth strategy, our teams continue to expand our footprint through bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, our global automotive store count expanded by 173 net new stores, up approximately 2% from 2022. We remain disciplined on our playbook for acquisitions and are confident in our ability to continue seamlessly integrating future businesses across all our segments and geographies to create value for our shareholders.  As we look ahead to 2024, we are seeing supportive industry fundamentals in both the Automotive and Industrial end markets. Within our global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs all supportive for the Automotive aftermarket, and we remain uniquely positioned in this space with our global footprint. Within our industrial business, macro indicators like industrial production, and the Purchasing Managers' Index continue to show improvement after 15 months of contraction. We stand to benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets and we are well positioned now and in the future to capitalize on reshoring trends. While industry fundamentals remain supportive, broader macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and persistent inflation in everyday purchases are pressuring the consumer and businesses alike. That said, the vast majority of parts and solutions we provide across both businesses are great fits and non-discretionary in nature. In our business, parts availability is paramount, and we are leveraging our enhanced data analytics and science to have the right part in the right place at the right time. As we continue to navigate the environment in 2024, it is imperative that we remain agile and move forward with a sense of urgency. Given current market conditions, we need to continuously take action to position our business for long-term success. This morning, we announced a global restructuring initiative to further simplify and streamline our business. Will and Bert will share more about the specific actions we are taking, along with the financial implications. So in closing, we are proud to have delivered on our financial commitments for 2023.  We accomplished this while taking decisive actions to improve our NAPA business in the U.S. while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth. We believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our teams' relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, both now and for years to come.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC team for another great year and for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the year, we also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, many of which we shared at our Investor Day last March. Globally, we align our strategic initiatives around five foundational priorities, which include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by disciplined and value-creating M&A. Our focus around these priorities drives global team alignment as we continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Turning to our results by business segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.1 billion, an increase of 2% with comparable sales growth of 1% versus the same period last year and 18% on a two-year basis. Average daily sales were essentially flat in October with low single-digit growth in both November and December.  Motion saw mixed results across its various end markets similar to last quarter, with particular strength in iron and steel, chemicals and mining. Categories like equipment and machinery and oil and gas were underperformers relative to the fourth quarter average.  Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives, including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share and improve productivity. For the full year, Motion sales grew $414 million or 5% with comparable sales of 5% and 22% on a 2-year basis. I'd like to take a quick moment to highlight our Motion team in Asia Pacific, who delivered a fantastic year. Sales and profit were up double digits in 2023 and the team continues to outperform our expectations. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $275 million, up 19% and 12.9% sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, Industrial segment profit was $1.1 billion up 24% and 12.5% of sales, representing a 200 basis point increase from the same period last year and exceeding the 2025 target that we set at our Investor Day.  Bert will take you through more detail on our outlook for the Industrial segment margin, but we're confident that our strategic initiatives can continue to deliver margin expansion. Throughout 2023, the profit improvement in Industrial was primarily driven by strategic pricing excellent operating discipline, the execution of our productivity initiatives and the accelerated integration of KDG. When we announced the acquisition of KDG in December of 2021 we set a target of approximately $50 million of synergies to be accomplished over a three-year period. We're proud to say that the integration of KDG is complete and we've realized $70 million of synergies a full year ahead of schedule. Turning to the Global Automotive segment, during the fourth quarter our International Automotive businesses posted positive sales growth in local currency, while sales declined at U.S. Automotive. Total sales for global automotive increased approximately 1% for the quarter, with comparable store sales decreasing 3%. For the full year, total sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 4% with comparable store sales increasing 2%, in-line with our guidance. The moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continues to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated throughout the year and ended the year in the low single-digit range compared to a high single-digit range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Global Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $259 million and segment operating margin was 7.5%, down 110 basis points. In the fourth quarter, all of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, although Global Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by the performance at U.S. Automotive. For the full year, automotive segment profit decreased approximately 1% versus the same period last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 4%. For the year, total sales growth was 16% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 8%. We're winning profitable market share gains across our European markets due to the on-going execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we saw low single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies and for the year, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our markets. This was driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand, generating over $400 million in the region, which exceeds our internal target for 2023. Congratulations to the entire AAG team for another outstanding year. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. This compares to strong double-digit growth in the comparable period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the fourth quarter. The team is executing well, converting the sales momentum in the quarter into strong operating margin expansion. For the year, sales increased 7% in local currency and comparable sales increased 6%. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the year with commercial growth up mid-single digits and retail growth up high single digits. Our Asia-Pacific team had another fantastic year and their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. They continue to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically invest for long-term success. Congratulations again to the Asia-Pacific team on another great year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 1% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 1%. For the year, total sales grew 5% in local currency, with comparable sales increasing 4%. We're pleased with the Canadian team's growth this year and the execution of their strategic initiatives, despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer in Canada.  In the US, automotive sales declined 5.6% during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales down 6.1%. A reminder that our comparable sales figure includes same-store sales out from our company-owned stores, as well as same-store sales into our independent owned stores. In the quarter, sales to commercial customers were down low single digits, while sales to DIY customers were down mid-single digits. For commercial, NAPA Auto Care saw low single-digit growth while major accounts sales were down mid-single digits.  Let me provide an update on the priority actions we're taking at NAPA that we explained on our third quarter call. We detailed three key areas to improve, including operational rigor in our stores, addressing fill rates in key product categories and working with our commercial teams to address growth opportunities in the field. First, we completed changes to certain key suppliers to improve fill rates. The changes have improved category trends in the fourth quarter and we're encouraged by the positive momentum. Second, our in-store service levels measured by on-time delivery to customers have significantly improved, as a result of increased focus on last-mile operating disciplines. Lastly, our commercial efforts are on-going and were highlighted by the appointment of Tom Skov to a newly created role of EVP Sales and Store Operations for NAPA. Previously serving as a Division Vice President in the West, Tom has over 20 years of field sales and operations experience with NAPA. He's an automotive parts expert and has a deep understanding of our customer's field sales and store operations. We're excited for the strong leadership Tom will bring to our sales and store operations field teams. While these actions drove encouraging improvements, the fourth quarter results at NAPA still missed our expectations. As we mentioned previously, the fourth quarter and December in particular, were difficult year-over-year sales comparisons for NAPA. Our average daily sales growth for NAPA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 10%, which included approximately 8% benefit from inflation with December 2022 sales up 13%. As expected, the benefit from inflation did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, December 2022 included the benefits of extreme winter weather for most of the U.S. With that context, as we look within the current fourth quarter for U.S. Automotive, the first two months of the quarter were in-line with our outlook that we shared last quarter. December performance, however, was well below our expectations, driven by unseasonably warm weather and moderated purchases from our independent owners. We have the opportunity to be with many of our largest owners at a week-long meeting in December. It was a productive series of discussions with high energy and good engagement. The outlook for the market fundamentals remains positive. We reviewed areas of commercial focus and detailed key initiatives to deliver profitable growth together. The NAPA competitive spirit is certainly high. A theme from the owner's feedback highlighted on-going efforts to manage their purchases as they balance operating costs in the current environment. Based on the session feedback, however, we remain optimistic that owners purchasing behaviors return to more normal patterns in 2024 and we're encouraged by the performance in January, albeit it's only one month. As we reflect on 2023 and move forward, we will continue to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive. We will be more intentional about owning more stores. A higher mix of company-owned stores in targeted priority markets enables us to service our repair shop and commercial customers more consistently and completely. We are also working actively to better align incentives with our independent owners to partner and grow together. We have current and future opportunities to create value in both our owned and independent owned locations. As an example, during the fourth quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 33 NAPA stores from our independent owners, ending the year with approximately 1,560 company-owned stores up 20% versus 2021. While owner acquisitions have been a long-standing aspect of the business, these trends accelerated in the fourth quarter and second half of 2023 and we would expect these accelerated trends to continue into 2024. The NAPA business navigated unexpected challenges in 2023, but the team adjusted and took decisive action to step up our operational intensity, simplify our priorities and improve service to our customers. As we look back during the year, a few highlights. We brought in new leadership with Randy Brow now leading the team and a proven internal leader as the new CFO. These seasoned executives got to work quickly identifying opportunities and improved our business clarity and priorities. We quickly assessed costs and took action to increase productivity and efficiency. We partnered with new suppliers to address poor fill rates in select key categories and surgically invested in inventory breadth and depth. We identified opportunities within our stores and DCs to improve our processes to ensure that we're delivering our customer commitments and executing locally. We accelerated progress on foundational talent, technology and supply chain investments, including as one example, a strategic global partnership with Google for analytics and search. And we're encouraged by some recent wins, including a structured inside sales program, planned introduction of new product lines and recent traction with loyalty programs with key customers. In 2024, we believe that supportive industry fundamentals combined with clear priorities and urgent action position NAPA to deliver success. For GPC, overall, our global teams are already actively executing 2024 priorities, focused on our key strategic initiatives across our businesses. We know evolving market environments require us to continuously evolve with them and to that end, as Paul mentioned, we announced a coordinated restructuring program across each of our global geographies.  The primary objective of the global program is to continue to simplify and streamline our operations, consistent with our overall business strategy. When we simplify, we increase the speed of local service, deliver operational productivity, improve the efficiency of our teams and reduce our overall cost to serve. This program is a similar playbook to our previous GPC program implemented in fall 2019 that delivered positive results. Aspects of the restructuring are already in flight and some will take place in the months ahead. Bert will go over the financial details of our restructuring and his remarks and update you on how it's reflected in our 2024 outlook. In closing, GPC delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results and we achieved the plan we laid out for 2023. This was driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Most importantly, it was driven by incredible effort from our global teammates to take care of our customers, live our GPC values every day and deliver performance. We're committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you, again, to the entire GPC team for another great year.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year continues to demonstrate our long history of delivering earnings and cash flow growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results, which include double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for 2023 were achieved while navigating through a dynamic and challenging year. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2023. Our comparisons to prior year, however, exclude nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG and an adjustment in the fourth quarter related to a remeasurement of our product liability reserve. As we look at 2023, sales totalled $23.1 billion, up 4.5% from 2022 and consistent with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 1.1% and with a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% favorable impact of foreign currency and other. These items were partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in comparable sales. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit levels of inflation in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations. As Will outlined, our fourth quarter sales performance was highlighted by the growth in Europe, Australasia and industrial, offset by the decline in U.S. Automotive. During the fourth quarter, our gross margin expanded by approximately 70 basis points. And for the year, our gross margin was 35.9%, an 80 basis point improvement from our adjusted gross margin in 2022. Our gross margin expansion was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives through investments in technology that enabled us to leverage data and analytics to ensure we have the right inventory for our customers to meet their needs. Total operating and non-operating expenses were 28.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from total adjusted expenses in the prior year. For the year, total expenses were 28.4% of sales, a 50 basis point increase from adjusted expenses in 2022. During 2023, we anticipated 60 basis points of deleverage related to our planned investments in team members and increased spending in technology, both of which came in line with our expectations. These investments were partially offset by cost actions throughout the year, particularly at U.S. Automotive. Despite the deleverage in SG&A, our fourth quarter gross margin expansion drove segment profit margin up 10 basis points to 9.6%. For the year, segment profit margin was 9.9%, a notable 50 basis point increase from 2022 and highlighted by our team at Motion driving an impressive 200 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit sales growth with industrial now representing approximately 50% of GPC's profit pool. Our fourth quarter earnings were $2.26 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per adjusted diluted share in the same period last year, an increase of 10.2%. For the full year, earnings were $9.33 per diluted share compared to $8.34 per adjusted diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.9%. Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and over $900 million in free cash flow, both in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior unsecured notes and used $250 million of the proceeds to repay debt that matured in December 2023. We closed the year with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, which compares to our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. Our capital expenditures in 2023, which totaled approximately $500 million or 2.2% of revenue, we're focused on driving the strategic initiatives we showcased at our March 2023 Investor Day. For 2023, 60% of our CapEx was growth capital centered on technology and supply chain capabilities, including projects related to distribution center expansion and modernization, fulfilment centers at Motion and using technology to enhance our catalogue and payment platforms. While modestly above our original expectations, the areas where we are investing are delivering good returns well above our cost of capital. We continue to make progress on the M&A front in 2023, a long-standing aspect of our growth strategy. During the year, we completed approximately 90 transactions, investing $309 million, with virtually all of these transactions in the Automotive segment. The blended EBITDA rate of the businesses acquired was over 9% on a pre-synergy basis and is accretive to our overall Automotive segment margin, demonstrating the discipline we have in the space. In 2023, we returned approximately $788 million or 55% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $527 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $261 million in cash used to repurchase 1.8 million shares. Before we turn to our outlook for 2024, as you heard earlier from Paul and Will, this morning, we announced a global restructuring designed to reduce our SG&A costs, improve efficiency and accelerate investments. In 2024, we expect to incur costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million related to our restructuring efforts, and we will report this as a nonrecurring expense. Through these efforts, we anticipate a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. Our current restructuring activities reflect our discipline to continuously refine and improve our business and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. As we turn to 2024, we are balancing solid industry fundamentals, which remain supportive for long-term growth across our businesses against a backdrop of mixed economic conditions, driven by high interest rates and persistent cost inflation.  Despite this, we remain confident in the execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect to realize. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate a more moderated first half and stronger second half in 2024 for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments. We are targeting full year gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points from further investments in technology. Our technology investments are key to enabling our strategic initiatives. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90, which represents an increase of 4% to 6% to last year. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance includes approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit related to our restructuring initiatives, which represents about half of the savings we are targeting for 2024. The successful execution of all our restructuring initiatives in 2024 provides an additional $0.05 to $0.10 EPS benefit, not included in our guidance. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. As we consider our sales guidance for automotive, our growth rate will be negatively impacted in 2024 and by approximately 100 basis points from new incentive programs associated with changes to certain supplier arrangements we previously announced in the U.S. Automotive business. Historically, these programs have been managed by our suppliers. Under the new arrangements, these will be managed by our U.S. automotive team. The new arrangements will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue, however, have a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and as a result, have no negative impact to gross profit. For Global Automotive segment margin, we expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year after finishing 2023 at 12.5%. Our performance in 2023 exceeded our long-term target of 12%, driven in part by our outstanding work to integrate KDG a year ahead of schedule. We will revisit our long-term target for Industrial in the future, but we see further opportunities for margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities; capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we added a new capability and further flexibility to pursue strategic investments with our commercial paper program launched in December. Our cash flows will remain strong in 2024 as we expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. As we outlined at Investor Day, investments in our supply chain and IT capabilities are central to our success. For 2024, we expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue, consistent with 2023. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast will drive modernization of our supply chain through automation and new DCs and fulfilment locations that are partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience like our investments in catalogue and search platforms through our partnership with Google. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value. Our strong track record of success, combined with our ability to put our balance sheet to work positions us well to further grow our global scale and footprint. In maintaining our focus on shareholder returns, this morning, our Board approved a $4 per share annual dividend for 2024, representing our 68th consecutive increase to our annual dividend. This represents a 5.3% increase from the $3.80 per share paid in 2023. In closing, our teams managed the business through a dynamic environment in 2023, including navigating unexpected pressures in our U.S. automotive business, while achieving mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to strategically invest in our business for the long term while taking actions to better align our assets in the near term and maintain our strong balance sheet. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thanks, good morning guys. So my first question is regarding the independent versus the company-operated stores. Can you talk at a high level what the comp look like between those two segments? And more importantly, do you have a sense of what POS is versus inventory at those independents. Presumably the deferral can only last so long. And would you expect that catch-up to happen relatively quickly?\nWillStengel: Morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I'll take your first part there to start. The independent owners and company-owned stores for NAPA through the quarter were relatively similar with the exception of December, where we saw a tail off as we noted in our prepared remarks, from the independent owner purchases. So I would say largely similar through the quarter with the exception of December. On the inventory levels and purchasing relative to sales out we did see a positive inflection as we went through the quarter towards the end of the year. And so we are encouraged that as we come into 2024, those inventory levels will better reflect the sales out activity.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then I guess as a follow-up and thinking about that, there was bad weather in December, good weather in January. So and you had the destock, restock. So I guess in light of that, can you talk about how you're thinking about the trend of the business? What's January? Should we look at those 2 months together? And how does that inform the cadence of U.S. NAPA over the year?\nBert Nappier: Chris, it's Bert. I'll take that 1 a little bit and maybe pull it up first before I talk specifically about January and getting into '24. But in terms of guidance, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're looking for 970 to 990 for the full year, 5% at the midpoint. Just to give you a little bit more color, we think the first half is a bit more moderated on both segments than the second half. Second half, we think will be a bit stronger. And that's really around how we're thinking about the interest rate environment, perhaps what could happen there in the second half and rebounding and improving industrial activity in the second half as well for the Motion business. Beyond that, you know the macro environment is pretty choppy. We've got high interest rates, stubborn inflation. We've got a lot of geopolitical considerations we're looking at, including an election here in the U.S. On the other side, we've got some of our own headwinds with some interest rate expense headwind for the year, and we'll be normalizing, as I said in my prepared remarks on inflation benefits against 23 million and looking at the cadence of the quarters, I don't want to give quarterly guidance. But as I just talked about, moderated first half, stronger second half and a few things specifically for Q1, we'll have some interest rate headwind -- interest expense headwind, excuse me, and a difficult comp promotion, they comped at 12% last year. Still strong industrial production Q1 of 2023. We'll come up against that here in the first quarter of '24. And for the NAPA U.S. auto business, we'll be looking at a comp against some high single-digit inflation from Q1 a year ago. Taking all that together, a long answer here, but taking all that together, we do expect the NAPA business to improve sequentially from Q4 on a reported basis even with that headwind from inflation. And we're encouraged, as Will said, with what's happening in January. We really feel like we're off to a good start, met our expectations for what we were looking for in January. But as you also look at the cadence of the year, I still expect Q1 to be our weakest earnings quarter of 2024, but remain very confident in our full year guidance.\nChris Horvers: And just a finer point on that, would you expect both Motion and Industrial and U.S. NAPA to be negative in 1Q on an organic comp basis?\nBert Nappier: Well, look, I don't want to get into giving you intra-quarter guidance since I'm not going to give you the quarterly guidance. I'll just kind of stick with where we are, not focus on 1 month since 1 month doesn't make a quarter but we're encouraged by January, particularly in the NAPA business, it improved sequentially from December and better expectations to start the quarter.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please go ahead.\nJosh Young: Hi. Good morning. This is Josh Young on for Scot. So if we look at the performance of the U.S. auto business, why do you guys think you're losing so much share there? And what do you need to do to gain back share given that it's typically pretty difficult to drive meaningful share shifts in this industry?\nWillStengel: Yes. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think we've shared both last quarter and this quarter, a lot of specificity about the work that we're doing proud of the progress that we're making. The script laid out a lot of the actions that we've taken specifically around operational intensity, inventory technology investments, field leadership, store operations, a big body of work, and we're highly confident that the team is going to turn it around as we move forward. So there's a lot to like -- we know we've got opportunities to get better, and we've got a lot of confidence in the team.\nPaul Donahue: Josh, I would just tag on to what Will said. We -- look, we own our results for '23. We've touched on that. It's now behind us. We've got new leadership at NAPA. We've got an improved supply chain -- we've got improved search capabilities, new sales structure in the field, and we're confident that business, as I think I said in my prepared remarks, our best days are in front of us. So we're encouraged, as Bert said, by the early days and early weeks of 2024. And again, looking for better days ahead.\nJosh Young: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one on margin. So if we think about the targets you outlined last year, obviously, you're running above that on industrial and you're talking about expansion for next year. But given what we've seen in auto for '23, how are you thinking about the target you laid out there?\nPaulDonahue: Yes. On the Automotive segment margin, we're guiding to 20 to 40 basis points of improvement for the coming year. We're building off of a continued strength in Europe and Australasia. We've got great businesses there with great share and good growth opportunities. And as Will outlined, we're optimistic about where both of those businesses are headed. When we turn back to the U.S., we've got a lot of actions in flight, and we're bullish on the things that are happening Will outlined all of those, but I don't want to be repetitive. But January is off to a good start for NAPA. We're encouraged by the result there. And we think that business improves, as I said, as we move throughout 2024. I would couple that with our restructuring, our restructuring activities that we announced this morning are intended to streamline the business and improve our efficiency, and we expect to get good benefits there as well.\nJosh Young: Yes. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. On the Industrial segment, where do you think margins can go now that you've experienced such significant growth over the last few years? And is there any reason to believe that you should give some of the growth back in the coming years?\nBertNappier: Thanks, Michael. Look, we guided to 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion for industrial in 2024 coming off of 12.5% in 2023 and 200 basis points of improvement this past year. I would just say the last 2 years have just delivered exceptional margin expansion for that business. We had good industrial production over that period. And most importantly, we had an outstanding execution of the integration of KDG. We got that a year earlier than we expected and at a higher level of synergy than we expected. So that helped the result in 2023. I'll be a little bit outsized, which is probably what's a normal run rate for the business. As we look at 2024, we'll operate in a little tighter economic environment. We'll have a little less top line in the first half than we did a year ago in the first half. And we're also going to be lapping those same KDG benefits that I just mentioned a moment ago. So 2024, we see a little bit of a recalibration for industrial back to what would be more historical for GBC in terms of growth, always committing to that 10 to 20 basis points of improvement. But having said all that, we see a long runway here. The industrial business is something we love. That team is just executing at a very high level. Will mentioned their operating discipline. They're focused on gross margin and we expect that to continue, which is why we've guided to more improvement this year, and we'll see that as we move into 2024 and beyond.\nPaul Donahue: And Michael, I would just tag on to what Bert said, we've been able to accomplish this while in the midst of the longest contraction on the PMI numbers, I think, since about '08. So we fully expect -- well, we're encouraged by the move in the right direction in the PMI numbers, we'll see industrial production, I think, today comes out. But we're expecting that manufacturing to shift back to a positive sometime in 2024. And that's just going to benefit the top line, which will benefit the overall business.\nMichael Lasser: Got you. My follow-up question is on North American auto business. What if you assume for market growth for 2024 within that segment, just so we can get a sense for how you're assuming your market share will trend in the year ahead? And have you made any assumptions around acquisitions within your growth expectations for this year? Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Yes, Michael, it's Bert. So we gave comp sales guidance for Global Automotive segment of 2% to 4%. I don't want to get into too much geographic difference. But we'll say that the market, when you take all of our geographies together, is somewhere between flat to 2% up. We've already talked about inflation, that will be about one point or so. And we're assuming that we'll get one point or so from acquisitions as we look at the automotive segment when we move through 2024. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the breakdown of how we're thinking about sales growth.\nMichael Lasser: Got it. All right, thank you very much and good luck.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hi, good morning, guys. Morning, Bret. Could you talk a bit more about the strategy of expanding the NAPA company-owned store base? I mean it sounds like you've added reasonably substantially to that. And are there either sort of a profile of the target acquisition by market or size? And sort of how do we think about that from a CapEx and margin impact going forward?\nWill Stengel: Yes. I'll take the first part, and then I'll pass it to Bert. Look, I think in 2023, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we reflected deeply on where we've got opportunities in the NAPA business here in the U.S. And part of that reflection was the strategic impact of owning more stores relative to independent owners. And that was accelerated as we talked about, based on some of the feedback that we heard from owners as they work through this kind of higher cost inflation and higher interest rate environment. And that led us to be very specific and strategic about market prioritization categorizing specific markets into different categories and then thinking about our operating model through that prism. And so the benefits of that, obviously, is takes some variation out of our network. It simplifies our network when we invest in initiatives the execution of those initiatives become easier throughout the network. And so I think there's a lot of qualitative and quantitative benefits that come from an evolution. The evolution will take time, obviously, but we think it's the right thing for us to do as we move forward. The good news, Bret, is that even when we look within our independent owner network and our company-owned network we've got great operations out there for us to replicate. And so while we will evolve over time, the value creation and operational opportunity in front of us is to get on both sides of the house, the underperforming stores up to best-in-class. And so that's a very actionable body of work. As it relates to capital allocation, I'll ask Bert to make a few comments.\nBert Nappier: Look, on the capital allocation side, this will show up as M&A. These are small acquisitions. And so that won't really be a CapEx number, but more of an M&A number. And look, they're very attractive to us. We have got a great balance sheet a lot of financial strength and flexibility to be able to lean in here and we'll have the ability to do that. These are attractive in terms of being accretive almost immediately as we recapture some of the margin we were sharing previously with an independent owner. We get to reduce some of the structural costs and the way we serve our customers. We'll capture some SG&A synergies, particularly on the IT side and with some of the team members and the overhead and back office ranks. And we'll drive some incremental sales, as Will mentioned. We really have an ability to partner our commercial activities where also with an independent owner, they may not be fully NAPA sourced, we'll be able to increase that as well. These are asset deals and always and generally in high-performing markets. So we like the lean here, and we think there's a lot to love.\nBret Jordan: Great. And then you commented that December, in particular, you saw independent volumes down or purchasing down. Is there anything -- was that a weather impact? Was that a sort of compounding effect of high rates on their cost of carrying inventory, sort of what do you attribute that air pocket and the independence too?\nWill Stengel: Bret, I think you nailed it. I think it was a cumulative effect of both of those cumulative effect of rates through the year, getting to year-end, closing the books, if you will, softer weather and then just getting ready for maybe a more robust 2024. So as we said in our comments, we're encouraged by the first 3 or 4 weeks of the year here and hoping for a more normal 2020 for as we move forward.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Brett.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore. Please go ahead. \nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I'd like to circle back on the restructuring activity. So Bert, could you help us understand the $100 million to $200 million? Is it cash, noncash? What's the portion there? And in terms of the synergies, what segments do they show up? Where will we see that in the P&L over time?\nBert Nappier: I'll start maybe with the second part of that. So in terms of where will they show up in the P&L, this is a global restructuring. So we'll have all the business units participating. In terms of breakdown of where you'll see things -- the biggest part of our SG&A cost is people cost. And so you'll see the vast majority of the benefit. About 2/3 of the benefit we expect to get will come out of the people side. It will be about half of the cost. It starts already. So we've announced last week, a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. That is the preponderance of the activity, and you'll see that show up in our U.S. business results as we move forward. The offer period for that closes here in the first quarter. So we won't expect any Q1 benefits of that, but you'll see those build as we get through the second half or last 3 quarters of the year. In terms of cash, noncash, I would say it's predominantly cash. We do have DC and facility consolidation. Some of that will be a noncash charge. But I would say at this point, particularly with the voluntary retirement offer in the U.S., it's predominantly cash. And then we both report it all at the nonrecurring expense as we move forward and call that out for you guys.\nGreg Melich: Got it. I appreciate that. And I guess, back on the business, could you just level set us now I know we're up to the 1,500 stores that are company owned. Could you level set us on what isn't company-owned, Well, how many independents there are, what's company-owned and then also the mix of business that's NAPA AutoCare major accounts and then up and down the street.\nWill Stengel: Yes. So today, Greg, for the NAPA business here in the U.S., it's about 25%, 30% company-owned and the balance independent owned. We have over 2,000 independent owners roughly. So that gives you some perspective. In total, we've got 6,000 stores in the U.S. So that gives you all the math there. As you look around the world, we have the independent owner model in Europe, obviously, it's about 1/3, 2/3 company-owned to independent on and about that same ratio in our Canadian business. And then we're a 100% company owned in our Asia Pac business.\nPaul Donahue: Greg, this is Paul. I'll jump in on the second part of your question regarding the business breakdown, major accounts roughly in the high teens, 20% range. NAPA AutoCare, which we're incredibly excited about the progress we're seeing in NAPA AutoCare. We've had a big surge in memberships over the last 90 days. That's about 20% of our overall commercial business. You mentioned small kind of mom and pop up and down the street. We've got a program as well in place where we're focusing in on getting back some of that business. That's about 20% roughly. And then you've got government and fleet, which for us, Greg, that's a significant part of our commercial business and one that -- we have long been incredibly strong and that's about the balance of your 40% of your commercial business. So I hope that helps.\nGreg Melich: It does. Thanks, and good luck, guys\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Please go ahead. \nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, Anne. Good morning. My question is on sell-in versus sell-through to independents in 2024. So as we sit here today, are you anticipating your guidance, those to be pretty equivalent?\nBert Nappier: Seth, I'm not sure I fully follow that. Run that one more time.\nSeth Basham: Sell-in versus sell-out for your independents. How they finished destocking from your perspective so that we should see more pressure on comps from that effect?\nWill Stengel: Yes, I think we're expecting 2024 to be a more normal year coming off of 2023, which was clearly challenged and different than our expectations.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And then my follow-up is, Paul, you talked about the up and down the street customers. Perhaps that's 1 area where you've seen some of the most pressure on your business. Are there competitive dynamics there that you didn't anticipate? And what are your plans for getting back to that business specifically?\nPaul Donahue: So I think Will mentioned, Seth, in his prepared remarks, he made some comments about our sales force restructuring more of and also taking an opportunity to learn a bit from our industrial team with an inside sales group that is focused on that type customer. There's nothing new on the competitor said, look, Seth, we've got great competitors, and they're tough and they ultimately raise the bar on us and make us better. And that's exactly how we're responding. So we think there's an opportunity to go back and capture some of that business, and we've got programs, incentives and people in place to make that happen. So again, encouraged 6 weeks into the year, early days, but we are encouraged with what we're seeing.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thank you. \nPaul Donahue: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nDaniel Imbro: Yes, hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions.\nPaul Donahue: Good morning, Daniel\nDaniel Imbro: Well, I want to start on the industrial side. I did get disconnected during Q&A, so apologies if you said this but obviously, industrial growth continued to outperform, I think, the broader market. I guess, what end markets are showing the most relative strength? And is that just share gains? And then when we look at the monthly cadence, this low single digit, is that the right exit rate as we think about 1Q and organic growth in the industrial side?\nWill Stengel: Daniel, I'll take the first part of your question. I think previously, we've shared some commentary with you on the end markets that we track here internally. There are about 14 of them. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's similar to Q3, it's a mixed mosaic as it relates to kind of growth versus contraction. Having said that, just maybe a few additional data points. As we look at the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter across those 14 in the fourth quarter, we had 9 of 14 in growth mode, which is an increase of 2 versus the prior quarter. And if you decomp that growth, we've got low single digits in 3 of them mid-single digits and 2 of them high single digits in 1 of them and double-digit growth in 3 of them. So on balance, we're encouraged by the sequential improvement versus third quarter and even in the 5 of 14 that are declining, we saw 3 of those 5 improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of, call it, the last 6 months' trends on all things end markets.\nPaul Donahue: And then, Daniel, you asked about Q1. As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. What I would tell you, Q1 will be our toughest comp of the year, Daniel. And I think as Bert mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're looking for really a strong -- much stronger second half. But I will tell you this, our industrial team is focused, you hit it in your question. I do believe we're taking share. We've got the best team in the industry, and I have no doubt they'll deliver for us in Q1 as well.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. I appreciate that. And then for a follow-up, I wanted to follow up on the restructuring. You talked about in the previous question, maybe where we're going to see it in the reported numbers. But I'm curious if we dig into like what kind of jobs are we actually reducing across the business? And how do you weigh that against the risk of service levels? It feels like some of your auto peers are investing into stores and into distribution. And so curious how you guys think about the competitive dynamics and how you view that risk in '24 as you try to maybe gain back some of the share?\nBert Nappier: Daniel, thanks for the question. Look, I would tell you that the big construct here is to protect the field customer-facing selling organization. It's super important to how we go to market how we can stay very competitive. And so as we look at the voluntary program in the U.S., which is, as I said earlier, the substantial majority of all the activity we're taking that voluntary program is very thoughtful. It's targeted to those that are closer to retirement, which is why it's a voluntary retirement offer. And mostly focused on management and back office spans and layers. And so I would just say that we feel really good about the thoughtfulness that was put in by our teams of how to make sure that we strike the balance here between continuing to serve our customers and deliver every single day, but at the same time, do the right thing for the business for the long term and streamline some of our costs.\nDaniel Imbro: Thanks, Bert. Good luck, you all.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Daniel.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC team for another great year and for their ongoing dedication to serving our customers. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the year, we also made significant progress on our strategic initiatives, many of which we shared at our Investor Day last March. Globally, we align our strategic initiatives around five foundational priorities, which include talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology complemented by disciplined and value-creating M&A. Our focus around these priorities drives global team alignment as we continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Turning to our results by business segment. During the fourth quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.1 billion, an increase of 2% with comparable sales growth of 1% versus the same period last year and 18% on a two-year basis. Average daily sales were essentially flat in October with low single-digit growth in both November and December.  Motion saw mixed results across its various end markets similar to last quarter, with particular strength in iron and steel, chemicals and mining. Categories like equipment and machinery and oil and gas were underperformers relative to the fourth quarter average.  Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives, including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share and improve productivity. For the full year, Motion sales grew $414 million or 5% with comparable sales of 5% and 22% on a 2-year basis. I'd like to take a quick moment to highlight our Motion team in Asia Pacific, who delivered a fantastic year. Sales and profit were up double digits in 2023 and the team continues to outperform our expectations. Industrial segment profit in the fourth quarter was $275 million, up 19% and 12.9% sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, Industrial segment profit was $1.1 billion up 24% and 12.5% of sales, representing a 200 basis point increase from the same period last year and exceeding the 2025 target that we set at our Investor Day.  Bert will take you through more detail on our outlook for the Industrial segment margin, but we're confident that our strategic initiatives can continue to deliver margin expansion. Throughout 2023, the profit improvement in Industrial was primarily driven by strategic pricing excellent operating discipline, the execution of our productivity initiatives and the accelerated integration of KDG. When we announced the acquisition of KDG in December of 2021 we set a target of approximately $50 million of synergies to be accomplished over a three-year period. We're proud to say that the integration of KDG is complete and we've realized $70 million of synergies a full year ahead of schedule. Turning to the Global Automotive segment, during the fourth quarter our International Automotive businesses posted positive sales growth in local currency, while sales declined at U.S. Automotive. Total sales for global automotive increased approximately 1% for the quarter, with comparable store sales decreasing 3%. For the full year, total sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 4% with comparable store sales increasing 2%, in-line with our guidance. The moderation in the sales benefit from inflation continues to be a factor in our year-over-year comparisons. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated throughout the year and ended the year in the low single-digit range compared to a high single-digit range in the fourth quarter of 2022. Global Automotive segment profit in the fourth quarter was $259 million and segment operating margin was 7.5%, down 110 basis points. In the fourth quarter, all of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, although Global Automotive segment margin was negatively impacted by the performance at U.S. Automotive. For the full year, automotive segment profit decreased approximately 1% versus the same period last year and segment operating margin was 8.2%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter with total sales growth of 10% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 4%. For the year, total sales growth was 16% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 8%. We're winning profitable market share gains across our European markets due to the on-going execution of our initiatives and strategic value-creating acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we saw low single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies and for the year, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our markets. This was driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expanding the NAPA brand, generating over $400 million in the region, which exceeds our internal target for 2023. Congratulations to the entire AAG team for another outstanding year. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the fourth quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. This compares to strong double-digit growth in the comparable period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the fourth quarter. The team is executing well, converting the sales momentum in the quarter into strong operating margin expansion. For the year, sales increased 7% in local currency and comparable sales increased 6%. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the year with commercial growth up mid-single digits and retail growth up high single digits. Our Asia-Pacific team had another fantastic year and their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth. They continue to drive market share gains, deliver strong operating leverage and strategically invest for long-term success. Congratulations again to the Asia-Pacific team on another great year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 1% in local currency during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 1%. For the year, total sales grew 5% in local currency, with comparable sales increasing 4%. We're pleased with the Canadian team's growth this year and the execution of their strategic initiatives, despite a softer macroeconomic backdrop and a more cautious consumer in Canada.  In the US, automotive sales declined 5.6% during the fourth quarter, with comparable sales down 6.1%. A reminder that our comparable sales figure includes same-store sales out from our company-owned stores, as well as same-store sales into our independent owned stores. In the quarter, sales to commercial customers were down low single digits, while sales to DIY customers were down mid-single digits. For commercial, NAPA Auto Care saw low single-digit growth while major accounts sales were down mid-single digits.  Let me provide an update on the priority actions we're taking at NAPA that we explained on our third quarter call. We detailed three key areas to improve, including operational rigor in our stores, addressing fill rates in key product categories and working with our commercial teams to address growth opportunities in the field. First, we completed changes to certain key suppliers to improve fill rates. The changes have improved category trends in the fourth quarter and we're encouraged by the positive momentum. Second, our in-store service levels measured by on-time delivery to customers have significantly improved, as a result of increased focus on last-mile operating disciplines. Lastly, our commercial efforts are on-going and were highlighted by the appointment of Tom Skov to a newly created role of EVP Sales and Store Operations for NAPA. Previously serving as a Division Vice President in the West, Tom has over 20 years of field sales and operations experience with NAPA. He's an automotive parts expert and has a deep understanding of our customer's field sales and store operations. We're excited for the strong leadership Tom will bring to our sales and store operations field teams. While these actions drove encouraging improvements, the fourth quarter results at NAPA still missed our expectations. As we mentioned previously, the fourth quarter and December in particular, were difficult year-over-year sales comparisons for NAPA. Our average daily sales growth for NAPA in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 10%, which included approximately 8% benefit from inflation with December 2022 sales up 13%. As expected, the benefit from inflation did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Further, December 2022 included the benefits of extreme winter weather for most of the U.S. With that context, as we look within the current fourth quarter for U.S. Automotive, the first two months of the quarter were in-line with our outlook that we shared last quarter. December performance, however, was well below our expectations, driven by unseasonably warm weather and moderated purchases from our independent owners. We have the opportunity to be with many of our largest owners at a week-long meeting in December. It was a productive series of discussions with high energy and good engagement. The outlook for the market fundamentals remains positive. We reviewed areas of commercial focus and detailed key initiatives to deliver profitable growth together. The NAPA competitive spirit is certainly high. A theme from the owner's feedback highlighted on-going efforts to manage their purchases as they balance operating costs in the current environment. Based on the session feedback, however, we remain optimistic that owners purchasing behaviors return to more normal patterns in 2024 and we're encouraged by the performance in January, albeit it's only one month. As we reflect on 2023 and move forward, we will continue to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive. We will be more intentional about owning more stores. A higher mix of company-owned stores in targeted priority markets enables us to service our repair shop and commercial customers more consistently and completely. We are also working actively to better align incentives with our independent owners to partner and grow together. We have current and future opportunities to create value in both our owned and independent owned locations. As an example, during the fourth quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 33 NAPA stores from our independent owners, ending the year with approximately 1,560 company-owned stores up 20% versus 2021. While owner acquisitions have been a long-standing aspect of the business, these trends accelerated in the fourth quarter and second half of 2023 and we would expect these accelerated trends to continue into 2024. The NAPA business navigated unexpected challenges in 2023, but the team adjusted and took decisive action to step up our operational intensity, simplify our priorities and improve service to our customers. As we look back during the year, a few highlights. We brought in new leadership with Randy Brow now leading the team and a proven internal leader as the new CFO. These seasoned executives got to work quickly identifying opportunities and improved our business clarity and priorities. We quickly assessed costs and took action to increase productivity and efficiency. We partnered with new suppliers to address poor fill rates in select key categories and surgically invested in inventory breadth and depth. We identified opportunities within our stores and DCs to improve our processes to ensure that we're delivering our customer commitments and executing locally. We accelerated progress on foundational talent, technology and supply chain investments, including as one example, a strategic global partnership with Google for analytics and search. And we're encouraged by some recent wins, including a structured inside sales program, planned introduction of new product lines and recent traction with loyalty programs with key customers. In 2024, we believe that supportive industry fundamentals combined with clear priorities and urgent action position NAPA to deliver success. For GPC, overall, our global teams are already actively executing 2024 priorities, focused on our key strategic initiatives across our businesses. We know evolving market environments require us to continuously evolve with them and to that end, as Paul mentioned, we announced a coordinated restructuring program across each of our global geographies.  The primary objective of the global program is to continue to simplify and streamline our operations, consistent with our overall business strategy. When we simplify, we increase the speed of local service, deliver operational productivity, improve the efficiency of our teams and reduce our overall cost to serve. This program is a similar playbook to our previous GPC program implemented in fall 2019 that delivered positive results. Aspects of the restructuring are already in flight and some will take place in the months ahead. Bert will go over the financial details of our restructuring and his remarks and update you on how it's reflected in our 2024 outlook. In closing, GPC delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results and we achieved the plan we laid out for 2023. This was driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Most importantly, it was driven by incredible effort from our global teammates to take care of our customers, live our GPC values every day and deliver performance. We're committed to our plans for long-term growth, and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you, again, to the entire GPC team for another great year.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. I'll take your first part there to start. The independent owners and company-owned stores for NAPA through the quarter were relatively similar with the exception of December, where we saw a tail off as we noted in our prepared remarks, from the independent owner purchases. So I would say largely similar through the quarter with the exception of December. On the inventory levels and purchasing relative to sales out we did see a positive inflection as we went through the quarter towards the end of the year. And so we are encouraged that as we come into 2024, those inventory levels will better reflect the sales out activity. Yes. Thanks for the question. Listen, I think we've shared both last quarter and this quarter, a lot of specificity about the work that we're doing proud of the progress that we're making. The script laid out a lot of the actions that we've taken specifically around operational intensity, inventory technology investments, field leadership, store operations, a big body of work, and we're highly confident that the team is going to turn it around as we move forward. So there's a lot to like -- we know we've got opportunities to get better, and we've got a lot of confidence in the team. Yes. I'll take the first part, and then I'll pass it to Bert. Look, I think in 2023, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we reflected deeply on where we've got opportunities in the NAPA business here in the U.S. And part of that reflection was the strategic impact of owning more stores relative to independent owners. And that was accelerated as we talked about, based on some of the feedback that we heard from owners as they work through this kind of higher cost inflation and higher interest rate environment. And that led us to be very specific and strategic about market prioritization categorizing specific markets into different categories and then thinking about our operating model through that prism. And so the benefits of that, obviously, is takes some variation out of our network. It simplifies our network when we invest in initiatives the execution of those initiatives become easier throughout the network. And so I think there's a lot of qualitative and quantitative benefits that come from an evolution. The evolution will take time, obviously, but we think it's the right thing for us to do as we move forward. The good news, Bret, is that even when we look within our independent owner network and our company-owned network we've got great operations out there for us to replicate. And so while we will evolve over time, the value creation and operational opportunity in front of us is to get on both sides of the house, the underperforming stores up to best-in-class. And so that's a very actionable body of work. As it relates to capital allocation, I'll ask Bert to make a few comments. Bret, I think you nailed it. I think it was a cumulative effect of both of those cumulative effect of rates through the year, getting to year-end, closing the books, if you will, softer weather and then just getting ready for maybe a more robust 2024. So as we said in our comments, we're encouraged by the first 3 or 4 weeks of the year here and hoping for a more normal 2020 for as we move forward. Thanks, Brett. Yes. So today, Greg, for the NAPA business here in the U.S., it's about 25%, 30% company-owned and the balance independent owned. We have over 2,000 independent owners roughly. So that gives you some perspective. In total, we've got 6,000 stores in the U.S. So that gives you all the math there. As you look around the world, we have the independent owner model in Europe, obviously, it's about 1/3, 2/3 company-owned to independent on and about that same ratio in our Canadian business. And then we're a 100% company owned in our Asia Pac business. Yes, I think we're expecting 2024 to be a more normal year coming off of 2023, which was clearly challenged and different than our expectations. Daniel, I'll take the first part of your question. I think previously, we've shared some commentary with you on the end markets that we track here internally. There are about 14 of them. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's similar to Q3, it's a mixed mosaic as it relates to kind of growth versus contraction. Having said that, just maybe a few additional data points. As we look at the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter across those 14 in the fourth quarter, we had 9 of 14 in growth mode, which is an increase of 2 versus the prior quarter. And if you decomp that growth, we've got low single digits in 3 of them mid-single digits and 2 of them high single digits in 1 of them and double-digit growth in 3 of them. So on balance, we're encouraged by the sequential improvement versus third quarter and even in the 5 of 14 that are declining, we saw 3 of those 5 improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of perspective of, call it, the last 6 months' trends on all things end markets."

            "content": "Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year continues to demonstrate our long history of delivering earnings and cash flow growth, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our results, which include double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter and for 2023 were achieved while navigating through a dynamic and challenging year. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter and 12 months of 2023. Our comparisons to prior year, however, exclude nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG and an adjustment in the fourth quarter related to a remeasurement of our product liability reserve. As we look at 2023, sales totalled $23.1 billion, up 4.5% from 2022 and consistent with our guidance. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 1.1% and with a 2% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% favorable impact of foreign currency and other. These items were partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in comparable sales. During the quarter, we experienced low single-digit levels of inflation in both our automotive and industrial segments in line with our expectations. As Will outlined, our fourth quarter sales performance was highlighted by the growth in Europe, Australasia and industrial, offset by the decline in U.S. Automotive. During the fourth quarter, our gross margin expanded by approximately 70 basis points. And for the year, our gross margin was 35.9%, an 80 basis point improvement from our adjusted gross margin in 2022. Our gross margin expansion was primarily driven by the execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives through investments in technology that enabled us to leverage data and analytics to ensure we have the right inventory for our customers to meet their needs. Total operating and non-operating expenses were 28.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from total adjusted expenses in the prior year. For the year, total expenses were 28.4% of sales, a 50 basis point increase from adjusted expenses in 2022. During 2023, we anticipated 60 basis points of deleverage related to our planned investments in team members and increased spending in technology, both of which came in line with our expectations. These investments were partially offset by cost actions throughout the year, particularly at U.S. Automotive. Despite the deleverage in SG&A, our fourth quarter gross margin expansion drove segment profit margin up 10 basis points to 9.6%. For the year, segment profit margin was 9.9%, a notable 50 basis point increase from 2022 and highlighted by our team at Motion driving an impressive 200 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit sales growth with industrial now representing approximately 50% of GPC's profit pool. Our fourth quarter earnings were $2.26 per diluted share compared to $2.05 per adjusted diluted share in the same period last year, an increase of 10.2%. For the full year, earnings were $9.33 per diluted share compared to $8.34 per adjusted diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.9%. Turning to our cash flows. For the year, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and over $900 million in free cash flow, both in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we issued $800 million of senior unsecured notes and used $250 million of the proceeds to repay debt that matured in December 2023. We closed the year with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, which compares to our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. Our capital expenditures in 2023, which totaled approximately $500 million or 2.2% of revenue, we're focused on driving the strategic initiatives we showcased at our March 2023 Investor Day. For 2023, 60% of our CapEx was growth capital centered on technology and supply chain capabilities, including projects related to distribution center expansion and modernization, fulfilment centers at Motion and using technology to enhance our catalogue and payment platforms. While modestly above our original expectations, the areas where we are investing are delivering good returns well above our cost of capital. We continue to make progress on the M&A front in 2023, a long-standing aspect of our growth strategy. During the year, we completed approximately 90 transactions, investing $309 million, with virtually all of these transactions in the Automotive segment. The blended EBITDA rate of the businesses acquired was over 9% on a pre-synergy basis and is accretive to our overall Automotive segment margin, demonstrating the discipline we have in the space. In 2023, we returned approximately $788 million or 55% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $527 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $261 million in cash used to repurchase 1.8 million shares. Before we turn to our outlook for 2024, as you heard earlier from Paul and Will, this morning, we announced a global restructuring designed to reduce our SG&A costs, improve efficiency and accelerate investments. In 2024, we expect to incur costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million related to our restructuring efforts, and we will report this as a nonrecurring expense. Through these efforts, we anticipate a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. Our current restructuring activities reflect our discipline to continuously refine and improve our business and ensure we are taking the necessary actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. As we turn to 2024, we are balancing solid industry fundamentals, which remain supportive for long-term growth across our businesses against a backdrop of mixed economic conditions, driven by high interest rates and persistent cost inflation.  Despite this, we remain confident in the execution of our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect to realize. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in a range of 3% to 5%. We anticipate a more moderated first half and stronger second half in 2024 for both automotive and industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels contributing less than 1% for both business segments. We are targeting full year gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 40 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 and 30 basis points from further investments in technology. Our technology investments are key to enabling our strategic initiatives. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90, which represents an increase of 4% to 6% to last year. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance includes approximately $0.10 of EPS benefit related to our restructuring initiatives, which represents about half of the savings we are targeting for 2024. The successful execution of all our restructuring initiatives in 2024 provides an additional $0.05 to $0.10 EPS benefit, not included in our guidance. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. As we consider our sales guidance for automotive, our growth rate will be negatively impacted in 2024 and by approximately 100 basis points from new incentive programs associated with changes to certain supplier arrangements we previously announced in the U.S. Automotive business. Historically, these programs have been managed by our suppliers. Under the new arrangements, these will be managed by our U.S. automotive team. The new arrangements will be accounted for as a reduction of revenue, however, have a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and as a result, have no negative impact to gross profit. For Global Automotive segment margin, we expect 20 to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% and with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate Global Industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year after finishing 2023 at 12.5%. Our performance in 2023 exceeded our long-term target of 12%, driven in part by our outstanding work to integrate KDG a year ahead of schedule. We will revisit our long-term target for Industrial in the future, but we see further opportunities for margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities; capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we added a new capability and further flexibility to pursue strategic investments with our commercial paper program launched in December. Our cash flows will remain strong in 2024 as we expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. As we outlined at Investor Day, investments in our supply chain and IT capabilities are central to our success. For 2024, we expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue, consistent with 2023. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast will drive modernization of our supply chain through automation and new DCs and fulfilment locations that are partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience like our investments in catalogue and search platforms through our partnership with Google. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value. Our strong track record of success, combined with our ability to put our balance sheet to work positions us well to further grow our global scale and footprint. In maintaining our focus on shareholder returns, this morning, our Board approved a $4 per share annual dividend for 2024, representing our 68th consecutive increase to our annual dividend. This represents a 5.3% increase from the $3.80 per share paid in 2023. In closing, our teams managed the business through a dynamic environment in 2023, including navigating unexpected pressures in our U.S. automotive business, while achieving mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to strategically invest in our business for the long term while taking actions to better align our assets in the near term and maintain our strong balance sheet. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Chris, it's Bert. I'll take that 1 a little bit and maybe pull it up first before I talk specifically about January and getting into '24. But in terms of guidance, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're looking for 970 to 990 for the full year, 5% at the midpoint. Just to give you a little bit more color, we think the first half is a bit more moderated on both segments than the second half. Second half, we think will be a bit stronger. And that's really around how we're thinking about the interest rate environment, perhaps what could happen there in the second half and rebounding and improving industrial activity in the second half as well for the Motion business. Beyond that, you know the macro environment is pretty choppy. We've got high interest rates, stubborn inflation. We've got a lot of geopolitical considerations we're looking at, including an election here in the U.S. On the other side, we've got some of our own headwinds with some interest rate expense headwind for the year, and we'll be normalizing, as I said in my prepared remarks on inflation benefits against 23 million and looking at the cadence of the quarters, I don't want to give quarterly guidance. But as I just talked about, moderated first half, stronger second half and a few things specifically for Q1, we'll have some interest rate headwind -- interest expense headwind, excuse me, and a difficult comp promotion, they comped at 12% last year. Still strong industrial production Q1 of 2023. We'll come up against that here in the first quarter of '24. And for the NAPA U.S. auto business, we'll be looking at a comp against some high single-digit inflation from Q1 a year ago. Taking all that together, a long answer here, but taking all that together, we do expect the NAPA business to improve sequentially from Q4 on a reported basis even with that headwind from inflation. And we're encouraged, as Will said, with what's happening in January. We really feel like we're off to a good start, met our expectations for what we were looking for in January. But as you also look at the cadence of the year, I still expect Q1 to be our weakest earnings quarter of 2024, but remain very confident in our full year guidance. Well, look, I don't want to get into giving you intra-quarter guidance since I'm not going to give you the quarterly guidance. I'll just kind of stick with where we are, not focus on 1 month since 1 month doesn't make a quarter but we're encouraged by January, particularly in the NAPA business, it improved sequentially from December and better expectations to start the quarter. Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Michael. Look, we guided to 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion for industrial in 2024 coming off of 12.5% in 2023 and 200 basis points of improvement this past year. I would just say the last 2 years have just delivered exceptional margin expansion for that business. We had good industrial production over that period. And most importantly, we had an outstanding execution of the integration of KDG. We got that a year earlier than we expected and at a higher level of synergy than we expected. So that helped the result in 2023. I'll be a little bit outsized, which is probably what's a normal run rate for the business. As we look at 2024, we'll operate in a little tighter economic environment. We'll have a little less top line in the first half than we did a year ago in the first half. And we're also going to be lapping those same KDG benefits that I just mentioned a moment ago. So 2024, we see a little bit of a recalibration for industrial back to what would be more historical for GBC in terms of growth, always committing to that 10 to 20 basis points of improvement. But having said all that, we see a long runway here. The industrial business is something we love. That team is just executing at a very high level. Will mentioned their operating discipline. They're focused on gross margin and we expect that to continue, which is why we've guided to more improvement this year, and we'll see that as we move into 2024 and beyond. Yes, Michael, it's Bert. So we gave comp sales guidance for Global Automotive segment of 2% to 4%. I don't want to get into too much geographic difference. But we'll say that the market, when you take all of our geographies together, is somewhere between flat to 2% up. We've already talked about inflation, that will be about one point or so. And we're assuming that we'll get one point or so from acquisitions as we look at the automotive segment when we move through 2024. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the breakdown of how we're thinking about sales growth. Thank you, Michael. Look, on the capital allocation side, this will show up as M&A. These are small acquisitions. And so that won't really be a CapEx number, but more of an M&A number. And look, they're very attractive to us. We have got a great balance sheet a lot of financial strength and flexibility to be able to lean in here and we'll have the ability to do that. These are attractive in terms of being accretive almost immediately as we recapture some of the margin we were sharing previously with an independent owner. We get to reduce some of the structural costs and the way we serve our customers. We'll capture some SG&A synergies, particularly on the IT side and with some of the team members and the overhead and back office ranks. And we'll drive some incremental sales, as Will mentioned. We really have an ability to partner our commercial activities where also with an independent owner, they may not be fully NAPA sourced, we'll be able to increase that as well. These are asset deals and always and generally in high-performing markets. So we like the lean here, and we think there's a lot to love. I'll start maybe with the second part of that. So in terms of where will they show up in the P&L, this is a global restructuring. So we'll have all the business units participating. In terms of breakdown of where you'll see things -- the biggest part of our SG&A cost is people cost. And so you'll see the vast majority of the benefit. About 2/3 of the benefit we expect to get will come out of the people side. It will be about half of the cost. It starts already. So we've announced last week, a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. That is the preponderance of the activity, and you'll see that show up in our U.S. business results as we move forward. The offer period for that closes here in the first quarter. So we won't expect any Q1 benefits of that, but you'll see those build as we get through the second half or last 3 quarters of the year. In terms of cash, noncash, I would say it's predominantly cash. We do have DC and facility consolidation. Some of that will be a noncash charge. But I would say at this point, particularly with the voluntary retirement offer in the U.S., it's predominantly cash. And then we both report it all at the nonrecurring expense as we move forward and call that out for you guys. Seth, I'm not sure I fully follow that. Run that one more time. Daniel, thanks for the question. Look, I would tell you that the big construct here is to protect the field customer-facing selling organization. It's super important to how we go to market how we can stay very competitive. And so as we look at the voluntary program in the U.S., which is, as I said earlier, the substantial majority of all the activity we're taking that voluntary program is very thoughtful. It's targeted to those that are closer to retirement, which is why it's a voluntary retirement offer. And mostly focused on management and back office spans and layers. And so I would just say that we feel really good about the thoughtfulness that was put in by our teams of how to make sure that we strike the balance here between continuing to serve our customers and deliver every single day, but at the same time, do the right thing for the business for the long term and streamline some of our costs. Thanks, Daniel."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company delivered on our financial commitments in 2023 and finished the year with a solid fourth quarter. Will and Bert will cover our results in more detail, but I'd like to share a few highlights.  During 2023, total GPC sales topped $23 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion from the prior year and in line with our expectations. We improved our total company segment profit margins by 50 basis points to nearly double digits, and we had our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. And notably, we returned $788 million to our shareholders this year and today, we announced that our Board approved a 68th consecutive annual increase to the dividend.  Our teams around the globe delivered a strong performance while remaining focused on our long-term strategic initiatives to profitably grow our business and deliver value for our customers. I want to take this opportunity to thank our more than 60,000 GPC teammates across the world for their dedication and hard work. Our fourth quarter and full year results again demonstrate the value of our complementary business mix paired with our geographic diversity. At our Investor Day back in March of 2023, we showcased our strategic initiatives and announced long-term financial targets for the first time in our history, all focused on delivering for our customers and delivering shareholder value. Clearly, this past year had its share of challenges and opportunities, but our performance in 2023 was a good start to achieve our three-year goals highlighted by the following. Our Motion team completed the integration of Kaman Distribution Group, and we exceeded our synergy target a full year ahead of plan. As an integrated business, Motion is a clear leader in their space, providing industrial aftermarket solutions with a compelling value proposition to more than 200,000 customers around the world.  In addition, during 2023, Motion continued to roll out their fulfillment center strategy, which is driving cost efficiencies, inventory productivity and improved customer service levels. During the fourth quarter, I had a chance to visit our fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida, and I can't say enough positive things about the team and their dedication to serving our customers. We're excited about the rollout of these facilities in 2024 and 2025.  Within Automotive, our International Automotive businesses outperformed our expectations in 2023. Our European team continues to expand their presence and gained market share through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. In 2023, we expanded our presence in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park with the acquisition of Gaudi, securing our position as the leader in this strategic market. And finally, the rollout of NAPA branded product in the European market has continued to surpass our expectations, a testament to the strength of the NAPA brand. In Australasia, our team is profitably growing market share with their fourth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth on top of industry-leading sales growth. Our supply chain investments in the region have improved the customer experience while driving productivity in our business. In North America, while results fell short of our expectations, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives and continue to make solid progress. We've undertaken a comprehensive review of the NAPA business to identify key issues, and we have taken action to improve the performance at NAPA. We are confident we are focused on the right initiatives to positively impact our performance in the quarters ahead. These initiatives, along with plans for long-term investments, were rolled out to our field leadership teams and across our independent owner group in December. The teams' competitive drive and energy were on full display, and we know that the best days for NAPA are in front of us.  And finally, as part of our long-term growth strategy, our teams continue to expand our footprint through bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, our global automotive store count expanded by 173 net new stores, up approximately 2% from 2022. We remain disciplined on our playbook for acquisitions and are confident in our ability to continue seamlessly integrating future businesses across all our segments and geographies to create value for our shareholders.  As we look ahead to 2024, we are seeing supportive industry fundamentals in both the Automotive and Industrial end markets. Within our global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and high vehicle prices and financing costs all supportive for the Automotive aftermarket, and we remain uniquely positioned in this space with our global footprint. Within our industrial business, macro indicators like industrial production, and the Purchasing Managers' Index continue to show improvement after 15 months of contraction. We stand to benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets and we are well positioned now and in the future to capitalize on reshoring trends. While industry fundamentals remain supportive, broader macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and persistent inflation in everyday purchases are pressuring the consumer and businesses alike. That said, the vast majority of parts and solutions we provide across both businesses are great fits and non-discretionary in nature. In our business, parts availability is paramount, and we are leveraging our enhanced data analytics and science to have the right part in the right place at the right time. As we continue to navigate the environment in 2024, it is imperative that we remain agile and move forward with a sense of urgency. Given current market conditions, we need to continuously take action to position our business for long-term success. This morning, we announced a global restructuring initiative to further simplify and streamline our business. Will and Bert will share more about the specific actions we are taking, along with the financial implications. So in closing, we are proud to have delivered on our financial commitments for 2023.  We accomplished this while taking decisive actions to improve our NAPA business in the U.S. while at the same time, investing in our strategic priorities to drive profitable growth. We believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our teams' relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, both now and for years to come.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Josh, I would just tag on to what Will said. We -- look, we own our results for '23. We've touched on that. It's now behind us. We've got new leadership at NAPA. We've got an improved supply chain -- we've got improved search capabilities, new sales structure in the field, and we're confident that business, as I think I said in my prepared remarks, our best days are in front of us. So we're encouraged, as Bert said, by the early days and early weeks of 2024. And again, looking for better days ahead. Yes. On the Automotive segment margin, we're guiding to 20 to 40 basis points of improvement for the coming year. We're building off of a continued strength in Europe and Australasia. We've got great businesses there with great share and good growth opportunities. And as Will outlined, we're optimistic about where both of those businesses are headed. When we turn back to the U.S., we've got a lot of actions in flight, and we're bullish on the things that are happening Will outlined all of those, but I don't want to be repetitive. But January is off to a good start for NAPA. We're encouraged by the result there. And we think that business improves, as I said, as we move throughout 2024. I would couple that with our restructuring, our restructuring activities that we announced this morning are intended to streamline the business and improve our efficiency, and we expect to get good benefits there as well. And Michael, I would just tag on to what Bert said, we've been able to accomplish this while in the midst of the longest contraction on the PMI numbers, I think, since about '08. So we fully expect -- well, we're encouraged by the move in the right direction in the PMI numbers, we'll see industrial production, I think, today comes out. But we're expecting that manufacturing to shift back to a positive sometime in 2024. And that's just going to benefit the top line, which will benefit the overall business. Greg, this is Paul. I'll jump in on the second part of your question regarding the business breakdown, major accounts roughly in the high teens, 20% range. NAPA AutoCare, which we're incredibly excited about the progress we're seeing in NAPA AutoCare. We've had a big surge in memberships over the last 90 days. That's about 20% of our overall commercial business. You mentioned small kind of mom and pop up and down the street. We've got a program as well in place where we're focusing in on getting back some of that business. That's about 20% roughly. And then you've got government and fleet, which for us, Greg, that's a significant part of our commercial business and one that -- we have long been incredibly strong and that's about the balance of your 40% of your commercial business. So I hope that helps. Thanks, Greg. So I think Will mentioned, Seth, in his prepared remarks, he made some comments about our sales force restructuring more of and also taking an opportunity to learn a bit from our industrial team with an inside sales group that is focused on that type customer. There's nothing new on the competitor said, look, Seth, we've got great competitors, and they're tough and they ultimately raise the bar on us and make us better. And that's exactly how we're responding. So we think there's an opportunity to go back and capture some of that business, and we've got programs, incentives and people in place to make that happen. So again, encouraged 6 weeks into the year, early days, but we are encouraged with what we're seeing. Thank you. Good morning, Daniel And then, Daniel, you asked about Q1. As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. What I would tell you, Q1 will be our toughest comp of the year, Daniel. And I think as Bert mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're looking for really a strong -- much stronger second half. But I will tell you this, our industrial team is focused, you hit it in your question. I do believe we're taking share. We've got the best team in the industry, and I have no doubt they'll deliver for us in Q1 as well."

Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'd like to start this morning with a few remarks on our overall performance before turning it over to Will, to cover the highlights of the automotive and industrial businesses. And then, Bert will get into the details of our financial performance, before we open the call to your questions. To recap the third quarter, total GPC sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year. Total company segment margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year, and diluted earnings per share were $2.49, an increase of 11.7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. I want to take this opportunity to give a call out to our GPC teammates around the globe, as we delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our third quarter results reflect our strong operating discipline and our ability to improve our operating margins and profits despite a more challenging topline environment. Overall, we continue to benefit from solid industry fundamentals in both the automotive and industrial end markets, including rational pricing environments in both segments. In our Global Automotive business, the underlying fundamentals of the aftermarket remain favorable, increasing miles driven, an aging and complex vehicle fleet, and high vehicle prices and financing cost. Within our Global Industrial business, we benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets, with overall growth driven by manufacturing and opportunities with onshoring and reshoring trends. Our automotive and industrial businesses are mostly break fix and non-discretionary in nature. And as a result, we remain focused on offering solutions that support our customers to have the right part, in the right place, at the right time, across both business segments. Sales in our industrial business were up slightly in the third quarter, and the team continues to deliver exceptional profit conversion as evidenced by a 180 basis points of segment margin expansion. During the quarter, demand trends were positive, but continued to moderate relative to the first half as expected. Over time, Motion has transformed its business into an industrial solutions provider, with a compelling value proposition. Motion serves diverse end markets with many of its product offerings being highly technical in nature. In addition, with the acquisition of KDG, Motion has added scale and enhanced its industry leading offering of value added services, such as fluid power, automation, conveyance, and repair. The Motion team is focused on executing on our strategic initiatives to expand gross margin, while remaining disciplined on cost, driving further segment margin expansion. Turning now to our Global Automotive business, we continue to see strong results across our international automotive businesses with the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in Europe, and record sales and profits in Australia and New Zealand. Our teams continue to focus on our key organic initiatives, in addition to our bolt-on acquisition strategy. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Gaudi, one of the largest independent players in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park, building on our 2022 acquisition of Lausan, Gaudi mainly operates in the Catalonia and Madrid regions, and creates further scale, and a national platform across Siberia, with the addition of 22 stores to our market leading position. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to our European business post synergies. We welcome the Gaudi team to GPC. While we were pleased with the growth internationally, the U.S. automotive business performance was below our expectations, with sales down 1.1%. Let me take a moment to share a few thoughts on the performance of U.S. auto. There is no doubt we've seen some challenges in 2023. From the record levels of inflation seen a year ago, which benefited the industry and have faded throughout 2023 as anticipated, it challenges across our own execution. Our year-to-date results demonstrated that we have not operated to our full potential in 2023. As many of you know, success in the automotive aftermarket is highly dependent on availability of inventory. Particularly for the important DIFM customer, which represents approximately 80% of our automotive revenue. Further, the automotive aftermarket has demonstrated consistent performance throughout all economic cycles. As we close out 2023, we are taking actions to better service our customers, and ensure our commercial activities are where they need to be. Under the leadership of Randy Breaux, we are confident the U.S. automotive team has taken the measures to improve execution with our customers. Will, plans to discuss these actions in greater detail. And before passing the call over to Will, we'd like to highlight our 2023 sustainability report, which we published earlier this month. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to build a more sustainable and equitable future for our planet. This year's report highlights the progress we've made as a company to measure and reduce our carbon footprint. This year, we are proud to report that in 2022, we further improve the measurement of our carbon emissions and have reduced scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by over 10%. We encourage you to build the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress. So, in closing, our performance in the third quarter, again, demonstrates our unique and differentiated portfolio. Will and I continue to visit with our global teams, including a recent trip to Europe and Australia. The teams are investing in the right areas of the business to drive long-term profitable growth, and they couldn\u2019t be more energized. We enjoyed a benefit of strong global brands and the GPC culture is alive and well across all our global operations. Further, we remain committed to the strategic investments and initiatives that we highlighted at our Investor Day back in March. We believe these investments are critical to our long-term success and are contributing to our financial performance both now and for years to come. We want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to, Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking the global GPC team for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate the hard work every day to deliver parts and solutions that help keep the world moving. It's great to see the teams work together as one GPC team to deliver customer success. We do this with coordinated focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology complemented by disciplined M&A strategy. To that end, I'd like to take a moment to specifically recognize the global teams for the progress on our numerous in-flight initiatives around the world. We're executing a broad set of initiatives across our global business and making strong and steady progress. The teams are simultaneously working to evolve the business for the better, while delivering on our day-to-day service commitments to our customers. As we detailed at our Investor Day, we believe we have compelling opportunities to invest back in the business and are excited about the progress and outlook. As Paul mentioned, we have great examples of progress around the world, specific examples range from state-of-the-art distributions centers with automation and next generation technology, enhanced data visibility and analytics capabilities, added talents and expertise, modernize technology platforms to enhance growth and productivity, and much, much more. We know the teams are working hard to execute the body of work, so thank you very much. Now, turning to the details of the business segment results. Before I get into the specifics, I should mention that the third quarter had one less selling day in the U.S. when compared to the third quarter last year. This impacted our total sales and comparable sales growth versus prior year, for both our industrial and automotive segments. During the quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. We estimate that the one less selling day negatively impacted Global Industrial sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Total sales for Global Automotive were $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.9% with a negative impact to Global Automotive of approximately 100 basis points, due to the one less selling day. Now, turning to the Global Industrial segment. Our quarterly results were essentially in-line with our expectations, and we remain ahead of our year-to-date plans. Recall that our expectation was for industrial growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Comparable sales growth increased 0.3% in the third quarter versus the same period last year. The same period last year was our highest quarterly comp during the year at approximately 20%. The monthly average daily sales cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with each month of the quarter up low single digits. During the quarter, Motion saw a more mixed result across its various end markets with the strongest growth coming from industries such as food products, iron and steel, and mining, offset by relative softness in equipment and machinery. As mentioned, Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology, and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share. As one example, the inside sales team initially formed in 2020 now covers approximately 25% of active customer accounts. The proactive sales calls are helping to drive profitable double-digit growth across the selling channel with a lower cost to serve. Our technology investments supporting revenue growth are also helping deliver better customer experience, with nearly 30% growth across e-commerce channels year-to-date, and e-commerce now at over 30% of total sales, up approximately 6 percentage points since 2021. Motion's second new fulfillment center in Fort Mill South Carolina is another example of exciting progress. This supply chain initiative consolidates various older legacy facilities while improving productivity, efficiency, speed, and service to customers. Our first fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida opened at the end of 2021 and has delivered outsized sales growth a 10% reduction in operating expenses and corresponding profit margin expansion. We'll continue to roll out this strategy with additional fulfillment centers opening scheduled for 2024. In Asia Pac, our Motion team delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with double digit sales and profit growth. Local teams are energized as reaffirmed by recent independent survey data showing high levels of team member engagement combined with market leading customer satisfaction rates. Motion is a trusted value-added advisor to its customers, and the team has detailed plans to win additional share in this fragmented market. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was approximately $283 million up a strong 16.6% and a 12.9% of sales representing a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in industrial was driven by another quarter of excellent operating discipline in both North America and Australasia. The accelerated integration of the KDG acquisition has contributed to the strong performance and we will exceed our $15 million synergy estimate by the end of this year. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Similar to the first half of the year, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification with our international auto businesses outperforming with mid-single-digit to double-digit sales growth in local currency. Comparable sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 0.6% in the third quarter and by geography include low to mid-single digit growth in each of our international businesses in comparable sales of negative 2.9% in the US. The moderation in inflation continues to be a significant factor in our year-over-year performance. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated in the third quarter to low single digits from mid-single digits in the second quarter. By comparison, in the third quarter of 2022, Global Automotive benefited from high single digit levels of sales inflation, which includes a benefit in the US of approximately 10%. We expect sales inflation in Global Automotive to be low single digits in the fourth quarter. Global Automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $322 million up approximately 4% versus the same period last year, and segment operating margin was 8.9% flat with last year. In the quarter, each of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, while US Automotive segment margin was down due to expense deleverage related to planned investments and the impact of lower sales. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the US, as Paul outlined, automotive sales declined approximately 1% in the third quarter with comparable sales down 2.9%, which includes the negative impact of one less selling day year-over-year as I had previously mentioned. Further, the third quarter of last year included the benefit of sales associated with our NAPA Expo. A sales event held approximately every five years, which negatively impacted our year-over-year comparisons by an estimated 170 basis point. Collectively, these two factors represent approximately 340 basis points of headwind in evaluating our year-over-year growth performance in the US. In the third quarter, sales to both commercial and retail customers were down slightly with commercial and DIY essentially performing at similar levels. Our commercial business was mixed in the quarter as fleet and government outperformed and major accounts remained pressure driven by the impact of tighter market conditions on the end consumer. The average daily sales cadence by month was July, slightly up, August, down low single digits, and we exited the quarter with September up low single digits. It's fair to say that our performance in the US automotive business was below our expectations, and we believe the underperformance is a combination of execution and further tightening of market conditions. On the execution side, we have not been crisp enough in the field with service to our customers. In addition, while supply chains have improved significantly post pandemic. We've experienced some lingering issues with inventory availability in a few product categories. Finally, the impact of tightening market conditions, including higher interest rates and persistence levels of higher cost inflation, has created a more cautious trading environment for our customers. Despite the challenges we're taking action, first, in terms of service in the field, we've taken actions to intensify our operational rigor at stores, and DCs as well as further enhanced our inventory strategies powered by investments we've made in data analytics tools. Second, we've experienced fill rates below our acceptable levels in a few product categories. This fill rate performance has taken too long to remedy post pandemic and as a result, our merchandising teams partnered with alternative suppliers to address the issue to ensure our markets are properly stocked. Finally, while we can't control the overall market conditions, we are working closely with field sales to drive incremental growth opportunities and we continue to be disciplined on costs, including ongoing cost actions, which Bert will discuss further. As mentioned, we've underperformed our expectations at US Automotive in 2023, but with new leadership enrolled for 100 days now, the team has clarity of the priority opportunities as taken actions and are quickly moving to get where we need to be. With solid industry fundamentals and the team's competitive drive to win, we're confident our US automotive team is positioned to overcome our recent challenges and execute on our long-term strategy to profitably grow share. In Canada, sales grew approximately 4% in local currency during third quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. During the quarter, our automotive and heavy-duty businesses grew mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. And we are pleased with the Canadian team execution of their strategic initiatives despite macroeconomic pressures and a cautious consumer. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter, which total sales growth of approximately 11% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. We continue to drive strong growth in market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our initiatives and strategic value creating acquisitions. During the third quarter, we delivered mid-single digit to double digit growth across each of our geographies driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts, and expanding the NAPA brand in the region. In addition, the team's making excellent progress on our new National Distribution Center in France that Paul, Bert and I had a chance to visit. Scheduled to open in 2024, this 50,0000 square foot facility helps evolve the network's strategy and upgrades the level of technology and automation within our supply chain. This effort complements a similar investment in the UK, and the teams are working well to leverage best practices. We expect these facilities to further drive productivity and efficiency as well as increased service level to our customers. In the AsiaPac Automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 6% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 5%. Sales for both commercial and retail were solid in the third quarter, with retail growth slightly above commercial. Having recently visited with this world class team, it's impressive to see the team consistently executing at such a high level and delivering another quarter of record sales and profitability. Our AsiaPac team is driving market share gains, improving profitability, increasing its employee value proposition all while executing strategic initiatives to create long term value. In closing, the global GPC team delivered solid third quarter results, driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix, and global geographic diversification. We remain committed to our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We're confident our teams are focused on the right long term strategic initiatives that will deliver customer solutions and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for your hard work, your performance, and your dedication to taking care of our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the third quarter reflects the operating discipline in our business, alongside the focus by our teams to serve our customers, which is evident with our double-digit earnings growth for the quarter. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our third quarter performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the third quarter and nine months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG. Double GPC sales increased 2.6% to $5.8 billion in third quarter of 2023. This reflects a 0.5% improvement in comparable sales, which includes low single digit levels of inflation, a 1.7% contribution from acquisitions, and a 0.5% favorable impact of foreign currency. Our sales performance reflects ongoing strength in international auto, continued, but moderating growth in industrial, offset by a decline in sales at US Automotive. Further, 1 less selling day in our US businesses negatively impacted sales growth by an estimated 120 basis points. Our ongoing execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives were the primary driver of our strong gross margin expansion. Gross margin was 36.2% in the third quarter, 130 basis point improvement from the same period last year. Given our performance year-to-date, we now expect our grow margin rate for the full year to improve 50 to 60 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 30 to 50 basis points of improvement. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the third quarter were $1.6 billion or 28.2% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.5% of sales in the third quarter last year, or an increase of approximately 70 basis points. The SG&A deleverage in the third quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, planned investments in wages and benefits for our teams, and increased spending and technology to support our strategic initiatives. These investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by approximately 35 basis points, while investments in IT and digital impacted SG&A by approximately 25 basis points in the third quarter. As you heard earlier from Will, within SG&A, the US Automotive team has been working hard to execute on cost improvement actions. The team has been successful in reducing headcount, implementing a hiring freeze, and driving discipline around travel and other discretionary costs. These actions are on track and equate to approximately 15 to 20 basis points of benefit which is embedded in our annual guidance and year to date results. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points based on our investments in our team members and IT. Our third quarter revenue growth and gross margin expansion drove total segment profit of $605 million up 9.6%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year and our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. This quarter's segment margin expansion is a clear reflection of the value of our portfolio diversification, highlighted by Industrial, which now represents nearly 50% of GPC's segment profit. While we deliver strong overall margin expansion driven by industrial, our Global Automotive segment margin was flat due to US Automotive. We've demonstrated consistent improvement throughout 2023 as global auto segment margins improved again sequentially. Further, we have identified opportunities to improve execution at our US Automotive business and position the business to take share. With a combination of operating discipline and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives to drive further operational efficiencies and productivity for the year, we now expect GPC segment margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points and increase of our previous outlook of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement. Our third quarter net income was $351 million or $2.49 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $317 million or $2.23 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the first nine months of 2023, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $733 million in free cash flow. We closed the third quarter with $2.2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Highlighting our flexibility and the strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to our four key priorities of capital allocation, which include the investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $350 million in capital expenditures, including $145 million in the third quarter. We remain disciplined investing in initiatives we believe will drive modernization and long-term growth for our business, as acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy we invested $211 million year to date for acquisitions, including the investment in Gaudi to expand our market leading position in Iberia. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of bolt on acquisition targets for our business. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned approximately $565 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $393 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $172 million in cash used to repurchase 1.1 million shares. We remain well positioned with solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet to effectively deploy our capital through any economic environment. Turning to our guidance. We continue to navigate a balanced mix of headwinds and tailwinds as we move into the fourth quarter. With that backdrop, we are reiterating our full year sales guidance and updating our diluted earnings per share guidance previously provided in our Q2 earnings release. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.30 an increase of approximately 10.3% to 11.5% from 2022. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.15 to $9.30. Our sales guidance is unchanged and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding for the following, 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. Within this outlook, we expect international automotive to be at the high end or above this range with US Automotive below. We also expect Global Automotive segment margin to be flat to slightly down for the year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 4% to 6% with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. As expected, the sales growth within this segment has moderated along with the industrial economy, and our outlook includes low-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. For the year, we now expect Global Industrial segment margin to expand by at least 150 basis points year-over-year. We are reaffirming our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow. We expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology, and supply chain, among others. In closing, our third quarter double-digit earnings growth demonstrates our ability to improve earnings and expand margins and low growth environments backed by a strong balance sheet and returns to our shareholders through our dividend. Our teams are delivering on what we said we would do for 2023, including our expectations for mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth for the full year. We look forward to closing the year strong and reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our call in February. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator, for your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I know your Investor Day wasn't all that long ago, but you guys had outlined some margin targets for each of your divisions, and while we've seen great progress on the industrial side. How are you guys thinking about your automotive margin targets given the performance from the last few quarters?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Scot, Bert. Thanks for the question. Look, I don't think we've changed how we're thinking long-term. We've got two years left on that cycle. And again, as we close out this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're looking for Global Automotive segment to be, flat to slightly down. With two years left, it's not unusual to get to a three-year plan a little differently, maybe than you started in March, and when we announced all that, but we still, still feel confident that the levers are there. As we look at the long-term margin expansion, particularly for auto, we got pricing and category management benefits. So, when talk about pricing and sourcing benefits and gross margin expansion. We'll continue to see those levers. And we've got further long-term investments, and that's really how we're thinking about this. We've got some short-term challenges, but a long-term investment around things like supply chain, investments in IT, those remain in early innings. And so, we're really still bullish on the long-term despite some of this near-term choppiness.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. That's, that\u2019s helpful. And then given some of the near-term choppiness, and you guys are obviously implement -- implementing various improvement processes to improve the U.S. auto business. But, the way this business typically works is, once you lose market share, it's kind of hard to get back. So how are you guys thinking about -- can, can you actually -- are you guys thinking that you can call that market share back or, are the changes you're implementing really just kind of patching holes in the ship and stopping incremental share losses? Thanks.\nWill Stengel: Yes, Scott, it's Will. Let me, let me add a few thoughts. And I'll start by just saying, the U.S. Automotive team, just to be very clear, is working incredibly hard every day to take care of their customers and be easy to deal with, and as you know, better than anyone, what that means for customers is, we got to be in a position to offer them the right quality part in the right place at the right time, and have that transaction be seamless. Once that product is available in the market, we needed to efficiently and quickly speak -- efficient and quick to search for the part and then pull the part and get it to the customer. And so, when you think about what we're working on everyday, we have the opportunities probably to be better in, each part of that. There's no single point of failure that has recently developed. I think this is just a call to action for the team that we need to be better across the board. The good news is, as you started with your question, and our initiatives that we detailed at Investor Day are all focused around these customer needs, and we're making good progress. And while, we might have been disappointed with recent performance, and might indicate that we've given back a little bit of share, we still feel good about what we're working on. We just need to do that body of work with more urgency at a faster pace.\nPaul D. Donahue: And Scot, I would, I would just add on to that. Look, we've been in this business a long, long time. There's nothing structural, that has shifted or changed in, in our business or in our, in our structure. We know the levers to pull, will hit on them. And trust me, there is a sense of urgency up and down, up and down the organization to get it done. I have no doubt we'll get it done.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. On the U.S. auto business, can you frame how much market share you have locked in the most recent quarter, and how does that compare to the run rate, or is that, is it getting better, or is it getting worse?\nPaul D. Donahue: And, Michael, can you repeat the last part of that question, you're, you're kind of fading in and out on it.\nMichael Lasser: Sorry, Paul. Sorry.\nPaul D. Donahue: That\u2019s all right.\nMichael Lasser: Are your share, yes, are your share losses getting better or are they getting worse?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Michael, I don't think it's getting worse. Listen, I think we're clearly disappointed with the recent performance. And as I said, that plus some of the performance of our credible competitors would indicate we've given back some share over the last couple of quarters. But maybe a few thoughts to elaborate on the whole, share thought, which is -- we've always had strong competition in this profit pool, both large and small. And as I said with Scot, it takes consistent execution everyday to serve those customers. And we just haven't performed to, our expectations in '23. I would tell you we have seen with the supply chain challenges moderating over the last 12 months, some of our smaller competitors have gotten more healthy, as it relates to inventory. And so, we're seeing them, playing from a different place of strength than they were maybe 12 months or 24 months ago. The good news is, is that we play in a huge market. It's very fragmented. And as, Paul said, we know what we need to do to return to a position where we're taking share. But we're not, we're not feeling like it\u2019s getting worse. We've got a good line of sight of what we're working on and taking action as we talked about on the call.\nPaul D. Donahue: And Michael, Michael, I would just add to that, that you really have to break down. I mean, it's a very broad question, when you start thinking about and talking about market share. It's very fragmented industry. Yes, you have the big four, but then you've got you know, independent WDs scattered throughout the country, along with, with others. So, you really got to look category-by-category. And what I'm pleased to see, and I'm encouraged to see is that when I look at specific product categories, product categories that move the needle, for our business, we have made changes, and we have improved our availability and we've improved our supply chain. And I would tell you if we're at fault for anything, it's it took us too long to make those changes. I think we'll touch on that. So, yes, no doubt better days are ahead and the team under Randy's leadership are all over.\nMichael Lasser: It\u2019s just my mic problem. Thank you very much for that. And my follow-up question is [Technical difficult]\nBert Nappier: Hey, Michael, it's Bert. You're still cutting out pretty, pretty bad. We can't hear you very well. Could you get a look --\nMichael Lasser: So hopefully, that's better.\nPaul D. Donahue: Oh, yeah, much, much better.\nMichael Lasser: All right. All right. Sorry. But my follow-up question is, some of the share dynamics influenced general parts -- Genuine Parts ability or willingness to do acquisitions in the U.S. auto business right now?\nBert Nappier: Hi, Michael. It's Bert. And first and foremost, welcome to the, to the universe of coverage for GPC. Thanks for joining, joining us. We appreciate that. I would say no. I mean, look, we look at what we're -- what's happening here, and as Will and Paul have given me some color on, really just as something we're managing through here in the near-term. The great thing about GPC is that we performed pretty well through all cycles. We've had $1.1 billion of cash generated here year-to-date $733 million of free cash flow. We have a tremendously strong balance sheet, and we're improving our margins and growing earnings double-digits despite some softer topline. And so, I think the great thing is that the performance of the business holistically allows us to continue to take advantage of the market including the M&A market and investments in capital expenditures that are great for the business long-term. And so while we may have a little choppiness short-term, it doesn't impact our ability to move, as we need to move, whether it's in U.S. automotive on M&A or the whole portfolio.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you. Sorry for the background.\nBert Nappier: No worries. Thanks, Michael.\nPaul D. Donahue: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. Some I'd love to go a little deeper in the trend through the quarter and the exit rate and particularly how, inflation may have impacted that.\nBert Nappier: Hey, Greg. It\u2019s Bert. I'll talk about inflation first, and then we'll come back to, kind of, our views on guidance and outlook. I think we've talked about this a little bit along the way throughout the course of the year. Inflation has really developed almost exactly as we expected with where we thought we would to begin the year. That's a little bit of a surprise and that we could be, kind of, that consistently, planning and thinking out the way we're thinking about the trends of inflation. We thought they'd moderate through the course of the year and they have. So, we started the year, with a mid-single-digits, moving to low-single-digits in Q2, all up low-single-digits here again in the third quarter. And we expect to finish out the year in low-single-digit. So, really has followed how monetary policy has been implemented around the world and tick down as we expected. One thing to call out on inflation, I think it's important to keep in focus and, Will mentioned it in his prepared remarks, inflation or said differently price, was a significant tailwind in 2022 for the automotive aftermarket. And that's dissipated in 2023, as I just kind of outlined. In particular, in third quarter a year ago, we were looking at inflation and sales at the high-single-digit level for the Global Automotive segment with the U.S. at nearly 10%. And that's a pretty tough comp when you think about low-single-digits for this particular period that we're coming up against. So, I think right now, moving as we expected, we'll close out the year low-single-digits, across the board. In terms of the outlook and how we're thinking about the rest of the year, bringing that up just a level, it'll start at the highest level and then maybe work down through getting to U.S. automotive. We think we've had a great quarter in terms of earnings growth, double-digit earnings here in Q3. That gave us some confidence to narrow our range and lift the bottom up, with a new guidance range of $9.20 to $9.30. As I said in my prepared remarks, we really have a mix of tailwinds and headwinds, tailwinds, solid industry fundamentals for both segments. We've improved our gross margin outlook, industrial margin for the full year as a bit better than we thought. There\u2019re some positive trends in industrial production data. I'm not ready to call a new trend, but at least it's leaning positive of late. And we're going to have continued ongoing discipline in costs, and that's going to lead to our expectations for segment margin expansion for GPC. In terms of headwinds, you guys know most of these. We've got a choppy environment out there. We've got inflation, geopolitical considerations, a new thing here in October with student loan repayments starting back. That's probably somewhere near $10 billion a month. So, obviously, something that will impact the consumer. Interest rate environment are up sharply over the last month. And so taken together, we see an increasingly cautious consumer. We're also going to be prudent about the time that it's going to take to, to effectuate some of the operational changes and rigor that, Will mentioned. So that taken together, I think, is how we're thinking about the rest of the year. But again, we expect a strong year when it's all said and done. We're going to close out the year based on our guidance with mid-single-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion, and we expect to have double-digit earning growth in a tough environment for the full year. And maybe Will, if you want to comment a little bit on the cadence of the quarter.\nWill Stengel: Yes. Greg, it's for, U.S. auto cadence of the quarter. It was mixed through the quarter. July was slightly up, as I think we said in our, prepared remarks, August was down low-single-digits, and we exited the quarter with September up low-single-digits. We did call out the NAPA EXPO, year-over-year compare. That event was in July of last year. By the time all the sales had processed, it's probably, it's not scientific probably impacting August. So, if you think about that adjustment, it's probably mid-quarter, mid-to-end of the quarter.\nBert Nappier: And Greg, I'll come back and give a little bit more color. You kind of talked about how things are looking as we start and maybe pull that up. As I think about this year on U.S. automotive, the full year, we started out Q1 with a little softer, weather impact there. And as we said in Q2, we really knew that our U.S. automotive business had more potential than we showed, and it's a feeling we continue to echo. Q2 made some new moves with new president. Cost actions to further drive some of the improvement of -- to offset the weakness on the topline. And the Q2 results were really a catalyst for the executive team to walk away and look at the things that were impacting our performance. We'll share those perspectives. But as we look at the fourth quarter with respect to U.S. AG or to the U.S. Automotive business, we know that we've got a tough comp coming up yet again. So, fourth quarter, for U.S. automotive was a 9.6 reported comp sales growth was 6.3. So, we have another fourth tough quarter ahead. And, all things considered, we expect the fourth quarter for them to be in-line with the third quarter.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And when did inflation peak last year. And maybe you've even brought it out some more like, average unit price, if you think about mix.\nBert Nappier: Yes. So, our third quarter would have been the highest inflation comp for the year for that business and, Will mentioned that. We've got another tough comp on inflation in the fourth quarter. That's going to be around 8% for the U.S. automotive business. So, the peak would have been Q3, but we still have a tough Q4 comp.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Thanks, and good luck guys.\nPaul D. Donahue: Thanks.\nBert Nappier: We appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Horvers of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nChristian Oberle: Hi. Good morning. It's Christian Oberle on for Chris. So, Motion organic trends have had been outperforming the ISM and, and industrial production as the, industrial economy had slowed. So, as you digest, the outsized share deals following the KDG acquisition, do those indicators become more relevant again? And as you look ahead, are there any end markets where there's reasons to believe it should reflect positively or negatively?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Christian. Thanks for the question. Look, those are two important data points. We monitor and track them closely. And, we've publicly said that it seems whether with KDG or post pandemic that, the correlation was less clear. Having said that, we still look at those indicators, and we've been encouraged obviously by the recent trends in particular industrial production. So, they're certainly part of what we look at as we inform our views of the outlook of the business and, based on those recent inflections, we're cautiously optimistic. There's no specific tie with those metrics to a specific part of our business. I think it's a good representation of the diversity of our business. And so, it's something that we look at in conjunction with customer, vendor feedback, provide different other pieces of internal and external data. But we\u2019re cautiously optimistic based on what we're seeing both in the business and from a third-party data perspective.\nPaul D. Donahue: Hey, Christian, I would just tag on to what, Will said. We are encouraged. One, we'll mention the industrial production numbers, which we saw nice a lift in September. But we've tracked 14 different indicators in our Motion business. Christian, we saw five of those indicators improve in September. So, categories like, I mean, automotive has continued to be positive food products, DC logistics, equipment leasing, all are trending up, including mining. So, yes, to Will's point have -- has the industrial downturn has had reached a trough. I think if it hasn't, we're darn close. And what we generally find is, as we see the major indices like industrial production begin to bounce back, we generally follow that somewhere 60 to 90 days later, we'll see our business begin to shift. So, again, great team at Motion. They've had a phenomenal year, and, and we're looking forward to better days here in 2024 on the top line for that group.\nChristian Oberle: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And as you think about gross margin, are there any one time or unsustainable items in 3Q just given and as you look ahead, you know, vendor allowances have historically driven a fair amount of volatility in 4Q gross margins. So, is there anything to call out there?\nBert Nappier: Hi Christian, its Bert. Nothing to call out, we had a really clean quarter on gross margin. Nothing related to some of the noise you just mentioned there. I'm super proud of the teams. They've executed at a very high level. So, our expansion of gross margin here in the third quarter of 130 basis points continues to come on the back of the investments we're making in sourcing and pricing.\nChristian Oberle: Got it. Thank you very much and best of luck.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Christian.\nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is regarding the pricing strategy in the US Automotive business. Obviously, you've done a great job improving your gross margins there. But what gives you the confidence that your less aggressive pricing is not leading to some market share losses?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Seth. This is Bert. Look, it's a good question. A thoughtful question. And we don't believe that our work around gross margin has come at the expense of share gains. You all know that price is not generally the leading factor. And driving sales in the aftermarket. It's more about availability and quality as Paul and Will have mentioned this morning. That's a really strategic question. It comes down to pricing strategies that category and SKU level, and the long-standing balance of that against unit growth. We believe the investments we're making in data analytics and pricing tool many of those we showcase at Investor Day have really given us an ability to be even more strategic and flex our strategy up and down, by both category and geography. It allows us to remain competitive, respond to the environment as it moves and stay in line with the market dynamics. So, I think the short answer is no. We don't believe that our work there is impacting, share gains or losses. And we continue to stay focused on driving our gross margin performance, we lifted our expectations for the year, now looking at 50 to 60 basis points of improvement for the full year. I\u2019m pleased with that result.\nSeth Basham: That's helpful color. And you mentioned responding to market dynamics you know, talked about some of your smaller competitors being better in stock. Last quarter, you talked about weighing the cost and benefits of the major account segment. Can you give us an update on that latter point? How you're thinking about major accounts at this point has become more price competitive there, and if you walked away for any business?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Seth. You know, I wouldn't say there's a material change in the major accounts part of the business. It continues to be pressured. We've been more disciplined as you alluded to in the way that we're thinking about the business or that piece of the business. It's about 15% to 20% of our commercial business. So, it's not a large, outsized portion of the total business. And as I think we've said before, it's inside of our major account business, there's four or five different even sub verticals. And there's different nuances associated with each one of those verticals. So, we have seen some consolidation in some of the, national players in particular, some of our existing customers that have come to consolidate that's impacted some of the year over year trends, just as they work through some of their acquisition activity. But generally speaking, the business continues to kind of, be at the same level that it was last quarter to slightly down.\nBert Nappier: Yes, Seth. Just a little additional color on that. We're, -- you know, as we break apart that major account business, which Will alluded to, where we see challenges in some of the big national tire chains. But on the flip side, we're seeing a good growth in our fleet and our government. We're seeing recent growth in the OE dealer segment, which we expect to continue as some of those challenges for that segment continues. So, there's puts and takes, but, again, our team is addressing those issues, and I think we'll see improvements here going forward.\nSeth Basham: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Yep. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWill Stengel: Hi, Daniel.\nDaniel Imbro: I want to start on the automotive margin. Maybe a follow-up to Scott's question earlier. I think you mentioned you know, pricing and category management as levers to still pull in the coming years. Just curious, as you think about some of the fixes in the auto business, as you expand the new suppliers, does that limit the category management benefit or the NAPA private label offering? And then pricing is good to hear. I guess you kind of answered it in the past question. Can you just talk about the pricing backdrop and the ability to use that as a lever to grow margins again?\nBert Nappier: Sure. Look, I don't think we've, think anything differently about the longer term, to follow-up on that earlier point. As I said, maybe we'll get there a little bit differently than we expected when we announced everything in March. This year's played out slightly differently, but we have two years ago, and gross margin, opportunities aren't going to be impacted by changes in suppliers. Actually, there are opportunities more than anything as we look continuing to be competitive going to market with our size and scale, looking at some of these opportunities, more globally and through a one GPC prism. So, I don't see those as limitations at all. They actually tend to be more of an opportunity for us. The pricing environment remains rational. We still think there's opportunity there. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've got great work and data analytics there that allows us to be flexible and nimble. And we haven't really seen a change in the way the competition is behaving in that space that would change our view on the longer term or the or the short term for that matter.\nWill Stengel: Yeah. Daniel, I would just add the, your question around the NAPA brand and category management. That's all upside. And just as a reminder, I think as we talked at investor day, when we look at category management now, we essentially by product category, we look at our global volume. So that NAPA brand has got strong presence now across Europe, AsiaPac and, of course, North America. So, to me, that's upside for our North American business. As we get into a better position, from a supply and inventory standpoint to really accelerate our growth in a couple of key product categories.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. That's helpful. And then just to clarify, Bert, I guess, you said you had one fewer selling day in the quarter. I guess, how did that happen? Was it timing of a holiday and what month did that fall in as we think about the cadency laid out? And then if there any makeup, if there are one more selling day in any quarter coming up, we should be aware of as a model.\nBert Nappier: So, Dan I missed the very beginning of your question. Can you give that back to me one more time?\nDaniel Imbro: You said one fewer selling day. Was it a holiday timing or kind of what drove that. And then what month did it fall into as we think about the cadence you gave us at month-to-month comps?\nBert Nappier: I'd rather not get into -- get into parsing out the quarter by month. The quarter year over year in the US, for both Motion and for US Automotive was impacted by one day. We'll just leave it there. And then, in fourth quarter, we're going to be flat on operating days.\nDaniel Imbro: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. We had two quick ones. First, is there a way to delineate between the pockets of where inventory is maybe a little light versus some of the execution issues that you highlighted in automotive. And is there a timeline of when inventory availability improves?\nWill Stengel: Yeah. There is we have great information, on where we've got our opportunities as we've talked about the last 12 to 24 months, investing in analytics, and in particular around inventory analytics has been an area of focus. So, I think that's made us better to know precisely where we have, opportunities. And the opportunities are not just availability, but it's movement. And again, there's nothing \u2013 there's not a new thought here. It's just better execution. That's taking the inventory that we have and getting into the right spot at the right time and making sure that you've got enough of the stuff that's moving fast. We've got a lot of visibility into that. And it's an ongoing effort. I mean, we've been working on this topic probably forever. And we're just stepping up our urgency. So, we'll, the teams that are urgent, they're focused on it, and we're going to make progress each and every day.\nPaul D. Donahue: And Kate, I would just tag out to what Will said. Specific categories that were problematic for us, during the pandemic and even post pandemic, those new programs are rolling out as we speak. So, we would expect to see improvements in those product categories here going forward.\nKate McShane: Okay. Thank you. And then our last question is just around the 340-basis point headwind in the quarter. Was that anticipated when you were originally guiding 4% to 6% same store sales in automotive? And if so, what is bringing that original comp guide of 4% to 6% down to 2% to 4%? Is it more what's being anticipated in Q4?\nBert Nappier: Yeah, Kate, it's Bert. Of course, we knew the expo headwind and the selling day was there. So that wasn't a surprise to us at all. Remember, we don't guide to quarters. So, we weren't thinking about through that \u2013 through a Q3 lens. We were thinking about our guidance through the full year. And we, you know, as we guided, thought we would sell through that. And again, we've reaffirmed our top line guide for the year this morning. We did lower the comp guide for automotive. I think that's just being smart, about having to factor in. The slower and softer performance for US Automotive year to date and what it's going to mean for the full year. But at the end of the day, as we thought about expectations, sales recovery didn't progress quite as quickly as we thought in Q3, Will has given you a lot detail around the execution things we're working on. And again, we've reaffirmed our full year top line this morning.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Kate.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Paul Donahue for any closing remarks.\nPaul D. Donahue: Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. And, just to reiterate, we want to thank all of our teammates around the globe for their efforts, in the quarter and year to date. And, just to let them know how much we appreciate, all they do for the company and for our customers. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and thanks for your combined and your continued interest in Genuine Parts Company. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Paul D. Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'd like to start this morning with a few remarks on our overall performance before turning it over to Will, to cover the highlights of the automotive and industrial businesses. And then, Bert will get into the details of our financial performance, before we open the call to your questions. To recap the third quarter, total GPC sales were $5.8 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year. Total company segment margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year, and diluted earnings per share were $2.49, an increase of 11.7% from adjusted diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year. I want to take this opportunity to give a call out to our GPC teammates around the globe, as we delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Our third quarter results reflect our strong operating discipline and our ability to improve our operating margins and profits despite a more challenging topline environment. Overall, we continue to benefit from solid industry fundamentals in both the automotive and industrial end markets, including rational pricing environments in both segments. In our Global Automotive business, the underlying fundamentals of the aftermarket remain favorable, increasing miles driven, an aging and complex vehicle fleet, and high vehicle prices and financing cost. Within our Global Industrial business, we benefit from a highly diversified portfolio of customers and end markets, with overall growth driven by manufacturing and opportunities with onshoring and reshoring trends. Our automotive and industrial businesses are mostly break fix and non-discretionary in nature. And as a result, we remain focused on offering solutions that support our customers to have the right part, in the right place, at the right time, across both business segments. Sales in our industrial business were up slightly in the third quarter, and the team continues to deliver exceptional profit conversion as evidenced by a 180 basis points of segment margin expansion. During the quarter, demand trends were positive, but continued to moderate relative to the first half as expected. Over time, Motion has transformed its business into an industrial solutions provider, with a compelling value proposition. Motion serves diverse end markets with many of its product offerings being highly technical in nature. In addition, with the acquisition of KDG, Motion has added scale and enhanced its industry leading offering of value added services, such as fluid power, automation, conveyance, and repair. The Motion team is focused on executing on our strategic initiatives to expand gross margin, while remaining disciplined on cost, driving further segment margin expansion. Turning now to our Global Automotive business, we continue to see strong results across our international automotive businesses with the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in Europe, and record sales and profits in Australia and New Zealand. Our teams continue to focus on our key organic initiatives, in addition to our bolt-on acquisition strategy. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Gaudi, one of the largest independent players in Spain, Europe's fifth largest car park, building on our 2022 acquisition of Lausan, Gaudi mainly operates in the Catalonia and Madrid regions, and creates further scale, and a national platform across Siberia, with the addition of 22 stores to our market leading position. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to our European business post synergies. We welcome the Gaudi team to GPC. While we were pleased with the growth internationally, the U.S. automotive business performance was below our expectations, with sales down 1.1%. Let me take a moment to share a few thoughts on the performance of U.S. auto. There is no doubt we've seen some challenges in 2023. From the record levels of inflation seen a year ago, which benefited the industry and have faded throughout 2023 as anticipated, it challenges across our own execution. Our year-to-date results demonstrated that we have not operated to our full potential in 2023. As many of you know, success in the automotive aftermarket is highly dependent on availability of inventory. Particularly for the important DIFM customer, which represents approximately 80% of our automotive revenue. Further, the automotive aftermarket has demonstrated consistent performance throughout all economic cycles. As we close out 2023, we are taking actions to better service our customers, and ensure our commercial activities are where they need to be. Under the leadership of Randy Breaux, we are confident the U.S. automotive team has taken the measures to improve execution with our customers. Will, plans to discuss these actions in greater detail. And before passing the call over to Will, we'd like to highlight our 2023 sustainability report, which we published earlier this month. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility to build a more sustainable and equitable future for our planet. This year's report highlights the progress we've made as a company to measure and reduce our carbon footprint. This year, we are proud to report that in 2022, we further improve the measurement of our carbon emissions and have reduced scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by over 10%. We encourage you to build the sustainability page on our website for more information on our progress. So, in closing, our performance in the third quarter, again, demonstrates our unique and differentiated portfolio. Will and I continue to visit with our global teams, including a recent trip to Europe and Australia. The teams are investing in the right areas of the business to drive long-term profitable growth, and they couldn't be more energized. We enjoyed a benefit of strong global brands and the GPC culture is alive and well across all our global operations. Further, we remain committed to the strategic investments and initiatives that we highlighted at our Investor Day back in March. We believe these investments are critical to our long-term success and are contributing to our financial performance both now and for years to come. We want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to, Will. And Scot, I would, I would just add on to that. Look, we've been in this business a long, long time. There's nothing structural, that has shifted or changed in, in our business or in our, in our structure. We know the levers to pull, will hit on them. And trust me, there is a sense of urgency up and down, up and down the organization to get it done. I have no doubt we'll get it done. And, Michael, can you repeat the last part of that question, you're, you're kind of fading in and out on it. That's all right. And Michael, Michael, I would just add to that, that you really have to break down. I mean, it's a very broad question, when you start thinking about and talking about market share. It's very fragmented industry. Yes, you have the big four, but then you've got you know, independent WDs scattered throughout the country, along with, with others. So, you really got to look category-by-category. And what I'm pleased to see, and I'm encouraged to see is that when I look at specific product categories, product categories that move the needle, for our business, we have made changes, and we have improved our availability and we've improved our supply chain. And I would tell you if we're at fault for anything, it's it took us too long to make those changes. I think we'll touch on that. So, yes, no doubt better days are ahead and the team under Randy's leadership are all over. Oh, yeah, much, much better. Thanks, Mike. Thanks. Hey, Christian, I would just tag on to what, Will said. We are encouraged. One, we'll mention the industrial production numbers, which we saw nice a lift in September. But we've tracked 14 different indicators in our Motion business. Christian, we saw five of those indicators improve in September. So, categories like, I mean, automotive has continued to be positive food products, DC logistics, equipment leasing, all are trending up, including mining. So, yes, to Will's point have -- has the industrial downturn has had reached a trough. I think if it hasn't, we're darn close. And what we generally find is, as we see the major indices like industrial production begin to bounce back, we generally follow that somewhere 60 to 90 days later, we'll see our business begin to shift. So, again, great team at Motion. They've had a phenomenal year, and, and we're looking forward to better days here in 2024 on the top line for that group. And Kate, I would just tag out to what Will said. Specific categories that were problematic for us, during the pandemic and even post pandemic, those new programs are rolling out as we speak. So, we would expect to see improvements in those product categories here going forward. Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. And, just to reiterate, we want to thank all of our teammates around the globe for their efforts, in the quarter and year to date. And, just to let them know how much we appreciate, all they do for the company and for our customers. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today and thanks for your combined and your continued interest in Genuine Parts Company. Have a great day."

We appreciate the hard work every day to deliver parts and solutions that help keep the world moving. It's great to see the teams work together as one GPC team to deliver customer success. We do this with coordinated focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology complemented by disciplined M&A strategy. To that end, I'd like to take a moment to specifically recognize the global teams for the progress on our numerous in-flight initiatives around the world. We're executing a broad set of initiatives across our global business and making strong and steady progress. The teams are simultaneously working to evolve the business for the better, while delivering on our day-to-day service commitments to our customers. As we detailed at our Investor Day, we believe we have compelling opportunities to invest back in the business and are excited about the progress and outlook. As Paul mentioned, we have great examples of progress around the world, specific examples range from state-of-the-art distributions centers with automation and next generation technology, enhanced data visibility and analytics capabilities, added talents and expertise, modernize technology platforms to enhance growth and productivity, and much, much more. We know the teams are working hard to execute the body of work, so thank you very much. Now, turning to the details of the business segment results. Before I get into the specifics, I should mention that the third quarter had one less selling day in the U.S. when compared to the third quarter last year. This impacted our total sales and comparable sales growth versus prior year, for both our industrial and automotive segments. During the quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, an increase of 0.6%. We estimate that the one less selling day negatively impacted Global Industrial sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Total sales for Global Automotive were $3.6 billion, an increase of 3.9% with a negative impact to Global Automotive of approximately 100 basis points, due to the one less selling day. Now, turning to the Global Industrial segment. Our quarterly results were essentially in-line with our expectations, and we remain ahead of our year-to-date plans. Recall that our expectation was for industrial growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Comparable sales growth increased 0.3% in the third quarter versus the same period last year. The same period last year was our highest quarterly comp during the year at approximately 20%. The monthly average daily sales cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with each month of the quarter up low single digits. During the quarter, Motion saw a more mixed result across its various end markets with the strongest growth coming from industries such as food products, iron and steel, and mining, offset by relative softness in equipment and machinery. As mentioned, Motion continues to make excellent progress with initiatives including sales excellence, pricing, e-commerce, technology, and supply chain strategies that are helping to win profitable market share. As one example, the inside sales team initially formed in 2020 now covers approximately 25% of active customer accounts. The proactive sales calls are helping to drive profitable double-digit growth across the selling channel with a lower cost to serve. Our technology investments supporting revenue growth are also helping deliver better customer experience, with nearly 30% growth across e-commerce channels year-to-date, and e-commerce now at over 30% of total sales, up approximately 6 percentage points since 2021. Motion's second new fulfillment center in Fort Mill South Carolina is another example of exciting progress. This supply chain initiative consolidates various older legacy facilities while improving productivity, efficiency, speed, and service to customers. Our first fulfillment center in Lakeland, Florida opened at the end of 2021 and has delivered outsized sales growth a 10% reduction in operating expenses and corresponding profit margin expansion. We'll continue to roll out this strategy with additional fulfillment centers opening scheduled for 2024. In Asia Pac, our Motion team delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with double digit sales and profit growth. Local teams are energized as reaffirmed by recent independent survey data showing high levels of team member engagement combined with market leading customer satisfaction rates. Motion is a trusted value-added advisor to its customers, and the team has detailed plans to win additional share in this fragmented market. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was approximately $283 million up a strong 16.6% and a 12.9% of sales representing a 180 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in industrial was driven by another quarter of excellent operating discipline in both North America and Australasia. The accelerated integration of the KDG acquisition has contributed to the strong performance and we will exceed our $15 million synergy estimate by the end of this year. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Similar to the first half of the year, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification with our international auto businesses outperforming with mid-single-digit to double-digit sales growth in local currency. Comparable sales for the Global Automotive segment increased 0.6% in the third quarter and by geography include low to mid-single digit growth in each of our international businesses in comparable sales of negative 2.9% in the US. The moderation in inflation continues to be a significant factor in our year-over-year performance. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated in the third quarter to low single digits from mid-single digits in the second quarter. By comparison, in the third quarter of 2022, Global Automotive benefited from high single digit levels of sales inflation, which includes a benefit in the US of approximately 10%. We expect sales inflation in Global Automotive to be low single digits in the fourth quarter. Global Automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $322 million up approximately 4% versus the same period last year, and segment operating margin was 8.9% flat with last year. In the quarter, each of our international geographies delivered margin expansion, while US Automotive segment margin was down due to expense deleverage related to planned investments and the impact of lower sales. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the US, as Paul outlined, automotive sales declined approximately 1% in the third quarter with comparable sales down 2.9%, which includes the negative impact of one less selling day year-over-year as I had previously mentioned. Further, the third quarter of last year included the benefit of sales associated with our NAPA Expo. A sales event held approximately every five years, which negatively impacted our year-over-year comparisons by an estimated 170 basis point. Collectively, these two factors represent approximately 340 basis points of headwind in evaluating our year-over-year growth performance in the US. In the third quarter, sales to both commercial and retail customers were down slightly with commercial and DIY essentially performing at similar levels. Our commercial business was mixed in the quarter as fleet and government outperformed and major accounts remained pressure driven by the impact of tighter market conditions on the end consumer. The average daily sales cadence by month was July, slightly up, August, down low single digits, and we exited the quarter with September up low single digits. It's fair to say that our performance in the US automotive business was below our expectations, and we believe the underperformance is a combination of execution and further tightening of market conditions. On the execution side, we have not been crisp enough in the field with service to our customers. In addition, while supply chains have improved significantly post pandemic. We've experienced some lingering issues with inventory availability in a few product categories. Finally, the impact of tightening market conditions, including higher interest rates and persistence levels of higher cost inflation, has created a more cautious trading environment for our customers. Despite the challenges we're taking action, first, in terms of service in the field, we've taken actions to intensify our operational rigor at stores, and DCs as well as further enhanced our inventory strategies powered by investments we've made in data analytics tools. Second, we've experienced fill rates below our acceptable levels in a few product categories. This fill rate performance has taken too long to remedy post pandemic and as a result, our merchandising teams partnered with alternative suppliers to address the issue to ensure our markets are properly stocked. Finally, while we can't control the overall market conditions, we are working closely with field sales to drive incremental growth opportunities and we continue to be disciplined on costs, including ongoing cost actions, which Bert will discuss further. As mentioned, we've underperformed our expectations at US Automotive in 2023, but with new leadership enrolled for 100 days now, the team has clarity of the priority opportunities as taken actions and are quickly moving to get where we need to be. With solid industry fundamentals and the team's competitive drive to win, we're confident our US automotive team is positioned to overcome our recent challenges and execute on our long-term strategy to profitably grow share. In Canada, sales grew approximately 4% in local currency during third quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. During the quarter, our automotive and heavy-duty businesses grew mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. And we are pleased with the Canadian team execution of their strategic initiatives despite macroeconomic pressures and a cautious consumer. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another strong quarter, which total sales growth of approximately 11% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. We continue to drive strong growth in market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our initiatives and strategic value creating acquisitions. During the third quarter, we delivered mid-single digit to double digit growth across each of our geographies driven by continued wins with key accounts, winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts, and expanding the NAPA brand in the region. In addition, the team's making excellent progress on our new National Distribution Center in France that Paul, Bert and I had a chance to visit. Scheduled to open in 2024, this 50,0000 square foot facility helps evolve the network's strategy and upgrades the level of technology and automation within our supply chain. This effort complements a similar investment in the UK, and the teams are working well to leverage best practices. We expect these facilities to further drive productivity and efficiency as well as increased service level to our customers. In the AsiaPac Automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 6% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 5%. Sales for both commercial and retail were solid in the third quarter, with retail growth slightly above commercial. Having recently visited with this world class team, it's impressive to see the team consistently executing at such a high level and delivering another quarter of record sales and profitability. Our AsiaPac team is driving market share gains, improving profitability, increasing its employee value proposition all while executing strategic initiatives to create long term value. In closing, the global GPC team delivered solid third quarter results, driven by the benefit of our strategic business mix, and global geographic diversification. We remain committed to our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We're confident our teams are focused on the right long term strategic initiatives that will deliver customer solutions and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for your hard work, your performance, and your dedication to taking care of our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Bert Nappier Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our performance in the third quarter reflects the operating discipline in our business, alongside the focus by our teams to serve our customers, which is evident with our double-digit earnings growth for the quarter. Before I walk you through the key highlights of our third quarter performance, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the third quarter and nine months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG. Double GPC sales increased 2.6% to $5.8 billion in third quarter of 2023. This reflects a 0.5% improvement in comparable sales, which includes low single digit levels of inflation, a 1.7% contribution from acquisitions, and a 0.5% favorable impact of foreign currency. Our sales performance reflects ongoing strength in international auto, continued, but moderating growth in industrial, offset by a decline in sales at US Automotive. Further, 1 less selling day in our US businesses negatively impacted sales growth by an estimated 120 basis points. Our ongoing execution of our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives were the primary driver of our strong gross margin expansion. Gross margin was 36.2% in the third quarter, 130 basis point improvement from the same period last year. Given our performance year-to-date, we now expect our grow margin rate for the full year to improve 50 to 60 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 30 to 50 basis points of improvement. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the third quarter were $1.6 billion or 28.2% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.5% of sales in the third quarter last year, or an increase of approximately 70 basis points. The SG&A deleverage in the third quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, planned investments in wages and benefits for our teams, and increased spending and technology to support our strategic initiatives. These investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by approximately 35 basis points, while investments in IT and digital impacted SG&A by approximately 25 basis points in the third quarter. As you heard earlier from Will, within SG&A, the US Automotive team has been working hard to execute on cost improvement actions. The team has been successful in reducing headcount, implementing a hiring freeze, and driving discipline around travel and other discretionary costs. These actions are on track and equate to approximately 15 to 20 basis points of benefit which is embedded in our annual guidance and year to date results. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points based on our investments in our team members and IT. Our third quarter revenue growth and gross margin expansion drove total segment profit of $605 million up 9.6%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 70 basis point increase from last year and our seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. This quarter's segment margin expansion is a clear reflection of the value of our portfolio diversification, highlighted by Industrial, which now represents nearly 50% of GPC's segment profit. While we deliver strong overall margin expansion driven by industrial, our Global Automotive segment margin was flat due to US Automotive. We've demonstrated consistent improvement throughout 2023 as global auto segment margins improved again sequentially. Further, we have identified opportunities to improve execution at our US Automotive business and position the business to take share. With a combination of operating discipline and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives to drive further operational efficiencies and productivity for the year, we now expect GPC segment margin expansion of 40 to 50 basis points and increase of our previous outlook of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement. Our third quarter net income was $351 million or $2.49 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $317 million or $2.23 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 11.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the first nine months of 2023, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $733 million in free cash flow. We closed the third quarter with $2.2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Highlighting our flexibility and the strength of our balance sheet. We remain committed to our four key priorities of capital allocation, which include the investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $350 million in capital expenditures, including $145 million in the third quarter. We remain disciplined investing in initiatives we believe will drive modernization and long-term growth for our business, as acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy we invested $211 million year to date for acquisitions, including the investment in Gaudi to expand our market leading position in Iberia. We continue to generate a robust pipeline of bolt on acquisition targets for our business. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned approximately $565 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $393 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $172 million in cash used to repurchase 1.1 million shares. We remain well positioned with solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet to effectively deploy our capital through any economic environment. Turning to our guidance. We continue to navigate a balanced mix of headwinds and tailwinds as we move into the fourth quarter. With that backdrop, we are reiterating our full year sales guidance and updating our diluted earnings per share guidance previously provided in our Q2 earnings release. We now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.20 to $9.30 an increase of approximately 10.3% to 11.5% from 2022. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.15 to $9.30. Our sales guidance is unchanged and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding for the following, 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. Within this outlook, we expect international automotive to be at the high end or above this range with US Automotive below. We also expect Global Automotive segment margin to be flat to slightly down for the year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 4% to 6% with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. As expected, the sales growth within this segment has moderated along with the industrial economy, and our outlook includes low-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. For the year, we now expect Global Industrial segment margin to expand by at least 150 basis points year-over-year. We are reaffirming our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow. We expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and free cash flow to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology, and supply chain, among others. In closing, our third quarter double-digit earnings growth demonstrates our ability to improve earnings and expand margins and low growth environments backed by a strong balance sheet and returns to our shareholders through our dividend. Our teams are delivering on what we said we would do for 2023, including our expectations for mid-single-digit sales growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth for the full year. We look forward to closing the year strong and reporting on our fourth quarter and full year results on our call in February. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator, for your questions. Yes, Scott, it's Will. Let me, let me add a few thoughts. And I'll start by just saying, the U.S. Automotive team, just to be very clear, is working incredibly hard every day to take care of their customers and be easy to deal with, and as you know, better than anyone, what that means for customers is, we got to be in a position to offer them the right quality part in the right place at the right time, and have that transaction be seamless. Once that product is available in the market, we needed to efficiently and quickly speak -- efficient and quick to search for the part and then pull the part and get it to the customer. And so, when you think about what we're working on everyday, we have the opportunities probably to be better in, each part of that. There's no single point of failure that has recently developed. I think this is just a call to action for the team that we need to be better across the board. The good news is, as you started with your question, and our initiatives that we detailed at Investor Day are all focused around these customer needs, and we're making good progress. And while, we might have been disappointed with recent performance, and might indicate that we've given back a little bit of share, we still feel good about what we're working on. We just need to do that body of work with more urgency at a faster pace. Yes. Greg, it's for, U.S. auto cadence of the quarter. It was mixed through the quarter. July was slightly up, as I think we said in our, prepared remarks, August was down low-single-digits, and we exited the quarter with September up low-single-digits. We did call out the NAPA EXPO, year-over-year compare. That event was in July of last year. By the time all the sales had processed, it's probably, it's not scientific probably impacting August. So, if you think about that adjustment, it's probably mid-quarter, mid-to-end of the quarter. Yes, Christian. Thanks for the question. Look, those are two important data points. We monitor and track them closely. And, we've publicly said that it seems whether with KDG or post pandemic that, the correlation was less clear. Having said that, we still look at those indicators, and we've been encouraged obviously by the recent trends in particular industrial production. So, they're certainly part of what we look at as we inform our views of the outlook of the business and, based on those recent inflections, we're cautiously optimistic. There's no specific tie with those metrics to a specific part of our business. I think it's a good representation of the diversity of our business. And so, it's something that we look at in conjunction with customer, vendor feedback, provide different other pieces of internal and external data. But we're cautiously optimistic based on what we're seeing both in the business and from a third-party data perspective. Yes, Seth. You know, I wouldn't say there's a material change in the major accounts part of the business. It continues to be pressured. We've been more disciplined as you alluded to in the way that we're thinking about the business or that piece of the business. It's about 15% to 20% of our commercial business. So, it's not a large, outsized portion of the total business. And as I think we've said before, it's inside of our major account business, there's four or five different even sub verticals. And there's different nuances associated with each one of those verticals. So, we have seen some consolidation in some of the, national players in particular, some of our existing customers that have come to consolidate that's impacted some of the year over year trends, just as they work through some of their acquisition activity. But generally speaking, the business continues to kind of, be at the same level that it was last quarter to slightly down. Hi, Daniel. Yeah. Daniel, I would just add the, your question around the NAPA brand and category management. That's all upside. And just as a reminder, I think as we talked at investor day, when we look at category management now, we essentially by product category, we look at our global volume. So that NAPA brand has got strong presence now across Europe, AsiaPac and, of course, North America. So, to me, that's upside for our North American business. As we get into a better position, from a supply and inventory standpoint to really accelerate our growth in a couple of key product categories. Yeah. There is we have great information, on where we've got our opportunities as we've talked about the last 12 to 24 months, investing in analytics, and in particular around inventory analytics has been an area of focus. So, I think that's made us better to know precisely where we have, opportunities. And the opportunities are not just availability, but it's movement. And again, there's nothing \u2013 there's not a new thought here. It's just better execution. That's taking the inventory that we have and getting into the right spot at the right time and making sure that you've got enough of the stuff that's moving fast. We've got a lot of visibility into that. And it's an ongoing effort. I mean, we've been working on this topic probably forever. And we're just stepping up our urgency. So, we'll, the teams that are urgent, they're focused on it, and we're going to make progress each and every day."

            "name": "Bert Nappier",
            "content": "Yes, Scot, Bert. Thanks for the question. Look, I don't think we've changed how we're thinking long-term. We've got two years left on that cycle. And again, as we close out this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're looking for Global Automotive segment to be, flat to slightly down. With two years left, it's not unusual to get to a three-year plan a little differently, maybe than you started in March, and when we announced all that, but we still, still feel confident that the levers are there. As we look at the long-term margin expansion, particularly for auto, we got pricing and category management benefits. So, when talk about pricing and sourcing benefits and gross margin expansion. We'll continue to see those levers. And we've got further long-term investments, and that's really how we're thinking about this. We've got some short-term challenges, but a long-term investment around things like supply chain, investments in IT, those remain in early innings. And so, we're really still bullish on the long-term despite some of this near-term choppiness. Yes, Michael, I don't think it's getting worse. Listen, I think we're clearly disappointed with the recent performance. And as I said, that plus some of the performance of our credible competitors would indicate we've given back some share over the last couple of quarters. But maybe a few thoughts to elaborate on the whole, share thought, which is -- we've always had strong competition in this profit pool, both large and small. And as I said with Scot, it takes consistent execution everyday to serve those customers. And we just haven't performed to, our expectations in '23. I would tell you we have seen with the supply chain challenges moderating over the last 12 months, some of our smaller competitors have gotten more healthy, as it relates to inventory. And so, we're seeing them, playing from a different place of strength than they were maybe 12 months or 24 months ago. The good news is, is that we play in a huge market. It's very fragmented. And as, Paul said, we know what we need to do to return to a position where we're taking share. But we're not, we're not feeling like it's getting worse. We've got a good line of sight of what we're working on and taking action as we talked about on the call. Hey, Michael, it's Bert. You're still cutting out pretty, pretty bad. We can't hear you very well. Could you get a look -- Hi, Michael. It's Bert. And first and foremost, welcome to the, to the universe of coverage for GPC. Thanks for joining, joining us. We appreciate that. I would say no. I mean, look, we look at what we're -- what's happening here, and as Will and Paul have given me some color on, really just as something we're managing through here in the near-term. The great thing about GPC is that we performed pretty well through all cycles. We've had $1.1 billion of cash generated here year-to-date $733 million of free cash flow. We have a tremendously strong balance sheet, and we're improving our margins and growing earnings double-digits despite some softer topline. And so, I think the great thing is that the performance of the business holistically allows us to continue to take advantage of the market including the M&A market and investments in capital expenditures that are great for the business long-term. And so while we may have a little choppiness short-term, it doesn't impact our ability to move, as we need to move, whether it's in U.S. automotive on M&A or the whole portfolio. No worries. Thanks, Michael. Hey, Greg. It's Bert. I'll talk about inflation first, and then we'll come back to, kind of, our views on guidance and outlook. I think we've talked about this a little bit along the way throughout the course of the year. Inflation has really developed almost exactly as we expected with where we thought we would to begin the year. That's a little bit of a surprise and that we could be, kind of, that consistently, planning and thinking out the way we're thinking about the trends of inflation. We thought they'd moderate through the course of the year and they have. So, we started the year, with a mid-single-digits, moving to low-single-digits in Q2, all up low-single-digits here again in the third quarter. And we expect to finish out the year in low-single-digit. So, really has followed how monetary policy has been implemented around the world and tick down as we expected. One thing to call out on inflation, I think it's important to keep in focus and, Will mentioned it in his prepared remarks, inflation or said differently price, was a significant tailwind in 2022 for the automotive aftermarket. And that's dissipated in 2023, as I just kind of outlined. In particular, in third quarter a year ago, we were looking at inflation and sales at the high-single-digit level for the Global Automotive segment with the U.S. at nearly 10%. And that's a pretty tough comp when you think about low-single-digits for this particular period that we're coming up against. So, I think right now, moving as we expected, we'll close out the year low-single-digits, across the board. In terms of the outlook and how we're thinking about the rest of the year, bringing that up just a level, it'll start at the highest level and then maybe work down through getting to U.S. automotive. We think we've had a great quarter in terms of earnings growth, double-digit earnings here in Q3. That gave us some confidence to narrow our range and lift the bottom up, with a new guidance range of $9.20 to $9.30. As I said in my prepared remarks, we really have a mix of tailwinds and headwinds, tailwinds, solid industry fundamentals for both segments. We've improved our gross margin outlook, industrial margin for the full year as a bit better than we thought. There're some positive trends in industrial production data. I'm not ready to call a new trend, but at least it's leaning positive of late. And we're going to have continued ongoing discipline in costs, and that's going to lead to our expectations for segment margin expansion for GPC. In terms of headwinds, you guys know most of these. We've got a choppy environment out there. We've got inflation, geopolitical considerations, a new thing here in October with student loan repayments starting back. That's probably somewhere near $10 billion a month. So, obviously, something that will impact the consumer. Interest rate environment are up sharply over the last month. And so taken together, we see an increasingly cautious consumer. We're also going to be prudent about the time that it's going to take to, to effectuate some of the operational changes and rigor that, Will mentioned. So that taken together, I think, is how we're thinking about the rest of the year. But again, we expect a strong year when it's all said and done. We're going to close out the year based on our guidance with mid-single-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion, segment margin expansion, and we expect to have double-digit earning growth in a tough environment for the full year. And maybe Will, if you want to comment a little bit on the cadence of the quarter. And Greg, I'll come back and give a little bit more color. You kind of talked about how things are looking as we start and maybe pull that up. As I think about this year on U.S. automotive, the full year, we started out Q1 with a little softer, weather impact there. And as we said in Q2, we really knew that our U.S. automotive business had more potential than we showed, and it's a feeling we continue to echo. Q2 made some new moves with new president. Cost actions to further drive some of the improvement of -- to offset the weakness on the topline. And the Q2 results were really a catalyst for the executive team to walk away and look at the things that were impacting our performance. We'll share those perspectives. But as we look at the fourth quarter with respect to U.S. AG or to the U.S. Automotive business, we know that we've got a tough comp coming up yet again. So, fourth quarter, for U.S. automotive was a 9.6 reported comp sales growth was 6.3. So, we have another fourth tough quarter ahead. And, all things considered, we expect the fourth quarter for them to be in-line with the third quarter. Yes. So, our third quarter would have been the highest inflation comp for the year for that business and, Will mentioned that. We've got another tough comp on inflation in the fourth quarter. That's going to be around 8% for the U.S. automotive business. So, the peak would have been Q3, but we still have a tough Q4 comp. We appreciate it. Hi Christian, its Bert. Nothing to call out, we had a really clean quarter on gross margin. Nothing related to some of the noise you just mentioned there. I'm super proud of the teams. They've executed at a very high level. So, our expansion of gross margin here in the third quarter of 130 basis points continues to come on the back of the investments we're making in sourcing and pricing. Thank you, Christian. Yes, Seth. This is Bert. Look, it's a good question. A thoughtful question. And we don't believe that our work around gross margin has come at the expense of share gains. You all know that price is not generally the leading factor. And driving sales in the aftermarket. It's more about availability and quality as Paul and Will have mentioned this morning. That's a really strategic question. It comes down to pricing strategies that category and SKU level, and the long-standing balance of that against unit growth. We believe the investments we're making in data analytics and pricing tool many of those we showcase at Investor Day have really given us an ability to be even more strategic and flex our strategy up and down, by both category and geography. It allows us to remain competitive, respond to the environment as it moves and stay in line with the market dynamics. So, I think the short answer is no. We don't believe that our work there is impacting, share gains or losses. And we continue to stay focused on driving our gross margin performance, we lifted our expectations for the year, now looking at 50 to 60 basis points of improvement for the full year. I'm pleased with that result. Yes, Seth. Just a little additional color on that. We're, -- you know, as we break apart that major account business, which Will alluded to, where we see challenges in some of the big national tire chains. But on the flip side, we're seeing a good growth in our fleet and our government. We're seeing recent growth in the OE dealer segment, which we expect to continue as some of those challenges for that segment continues. So, there's puts and takes, but, again, our team is addressing those issues, and I think we'll see improvements here going forward. Sure. Look, I don't think we've, think anything differently about the longer term, to follow-up on that earlier point. As I said, maybe we'll get there a little bit differently than we expected when we announced everything in March. This year's played out slightly differently, but we have two years ago, and gross margin, opportunities aren't going to be impacted by changes in suppliers. Actually, there are opportunities more than anything as we look continuing to be competitive going to market with our size and scale, looking at some of these opportunities, more globally and through a one GPC prism. So, I don't see those as limitations at all. They actually tend to be more of an opportunity for us. The pricing environment remains rational. We still think there's opportunity there. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've got great work and data analytics there that allows us to be flexible and nimble. And we haven't really seen a change in the way the competition is behaving in that space that would change our view on the longer term or the or the short term for that matter. So, Dan I missed the very beginning of your question. Can you give that back to me one more time? I'd rather not get into -- get into parsing out the quarter by month. The quarter year over year in the US, for both Motion and for US Automotive was impacted by one day. We'll just leave it there. And then, in fourth quarter, we're going to be flat on operating days. Yeah, Kate, it's Bert. Of course, we knew the expo headwind and the selling day was there. So that wasn't a surprise to us at all. Remember, we don't guide to quarters. So, we weren't thinking about through that \u2013 through a Q3 lens. We were thinking about our guidance through the full year. And we, you know, as we guided, thought we would sell through that. And again, we've reaffirmed our top line guide for the year this morning. We did lower the comp guide for automotive. I think that's just being smart, about having to factor in. The slower and softer performance for US Automotive year to date and what it's going to mean for the full year. But at the end of the day, as we thought about expectations, sales recovery didn't progress quite as quickly as we thought in Q3, Will has given you a lot detail around the execution things we're working on. And again, we've reaffirmed our full year top line this morning. Thanks, Kate."

[Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSidney Jones: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.  With me today to share their remarks are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Will Stengel, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bert Nappier, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tim Walsh, our Senior Director, Investor Relations, has also joined us. In addition to this morning's press release, a supplemental slide presentation can be found on the Investors page of the Genuine Parts Company website. Please be advised this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to during today's discussion of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of these measures is provided in the earnings press release. Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.  Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with record sales and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our second quarter once again highlights the value and benefit of our global automotive and industrial businesses and the mix and geographic diversity of our company which we believe are competitive advantages that differentiate GPC in the marketplace. A few highlights from our second quarter results include: Total sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 5.6% from the prior year. Total company segment margin of 10.4% and an increase of 60 basis points from the same quarter last year. Earnings per share of $2.44, an increase of 10.9% from adjusted earnings per share last year, and our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation priorities. Our global team remains focused on the strategic initiatives we highlighted at our Investor Day in March. And we believe our One GPC approach is contributing to our strong financial performance. We compete in 2 very large and fragmented markets and see significant opportunities to grow our business, expand our margin profile and generate strong cash flow to support our strategic investments while delivering returns to our shareholders. As we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, we believe our focused execution, investments in our business and strong industry fundamentals, position GPC for long-term success. Looking at our Industrial segment, demand trends held solid through the second quarter, even as the rate of sales growth tempered a bit relative to the first quarter as we expected. Motion's growth rate on a 2-year basis continues to be exceptional. And while certain economic indicators have slowed, we believe our strong market share position, along with the diversity of our products, services and end markets bode well for our continued growth prospects. In addition, future reshoring opportunities and the growth of domestic manufacturing industries provide significant opportunity for Motion. And as you will hear from Will, our team's focus on productivity and efficiency is driving significant margin expansion in the Industrial segment. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the broad geographic diversity of our markets. In addition, we believe our long history of supporting the DIFM customer segment which is 80% of our global automotive sales, positions us well as sales growth to DIFM customers continues to outpace DIY sales growth. During the second quarter, our international Automotive businesses delivered strong mid-single to double-digit growth, while our U.S. automotive business experienced low single-digit growth. The fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket remain favorable with trends such as increasing miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet, rising interest rates, and continued high prices for vehicles, all contributing to underlying demand. While the near-term environment remains dynamic, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. And with the strong earnings growth in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for 2023 earnings per share, which Bert will discuss further. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategic plans, and we'll continue to invest to strengthen our business and achieve both our near- and long-term financial targets while returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So in closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the outstanding work of our HR and IT teams in Q2 around our implementation of Workday. In early July, we completed the first phase of our implementation of the Workday HR platform in North America. Continuing to demonstrate the modernization of our system platforms and supporting our teams with the right tools and the right technology. Our HR and IT teams delivered an exceptional outcome, well ahead of schedule, showcasing the benefits of our One GPC talent and technology initiatives. So before I turn it over to Will, we want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWilliam Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate all the hard work to take care of our customers every day with solutions that help keep the world moving. We do this with focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. We work together as One GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value. On behalf of the entire GPC team, we would like to congratulate Kevin Herron on his well-deserved retirement after an amazing 34-year career at the company. Kevin earned success in all of his roles over the years, including the last 5 years as President of the U.S. Automotive business. He embodies our GPC values and he's been an inspirational leader and mentor to many around the world. We're deeply grateful for his significant contributions to Genuine Parts Company and wish him the very best in his retirement. With Kevin's retirement, we also want to congratulate Randy Breaux on his promotion to Group President, GPC North America effective July 1st. In the new role, Randy will oversee both the automotive and industrial businesses across North America, while assuming day-to-day responsibility as President of the U.S. Automotive Group. Randy is a proven leader with a track record of performance. His relevant expertise across distribution industries, familiarity with GPC teammates and stakeholders and success at Motion make him the ideal candidate for the role. This transition represents the depth of our leadership team and our talent strategies as we continue to leverage the power of One GPC. Now turning to our 2 business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an increase of $125 million or 5.9%. Comparable sales growth increased 6.0% in the second quarter versus last year. The cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with April being the strongest month followed by mid-single-digit growth in both May and June. The sales growth at Motion was broad-based again in the second quarter, with all product categories and major industries served posting positive gains from the prior year. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, iron and steel, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to make excellent progress with its initiatives including inside and outside sales, pricing, e-commerce, growth-focused tech and supply chain strategies, they're all helping to win profitable market share. As an example, Motion has seen a nearly twofold increase in average daily sales across its e-commerce platform since 2021, which now represent nearly 30% of total Motion daily sales. In Asia Pac, our Motion business also delivered strong performance in the second quarter with double-digit sales and profit growth. Customer-centric initiatives across talent and culture, inventory availability and operational excellence are delivering positive results. Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $283 million or 12.5% of sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in Industrial was driven by excellent operating rigor in both North America and Australasia and the disciplined execution of strategic initiatives. In addition, the Motion North America team continues to realize synergies related to the KDG acquisition. The team is substantially complete with the branch consolidation and merger efforts well ahead of initial plans. And we expect to exceed our 3-year $50 million synergy commitment by the end of this year, also well ahead of initial plans. Turning to Global Automotive. Total sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.4% versus the same period in 2022. Similar to the first quarter, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the U.S. posted mid-single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased 4.3%, ranging from low single-digit growth in the U.S. to low double-digit growth in Europe. We saw global automotive sales inflation moderate from high single-digit growth in the first quarter to low to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable fundamentals and solid team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth. Global Automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $329 million, up 2.1% versus the same period in 2022. And segment operating margin was 9.0% compared to 9.3% in 2022. As expected, Automotive's margin showed an improvement versus the first quarter. The improvement in the second quarter reflects the impact of the cost actions implemented at U.S. Automotive, and we expect to see an increased benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.  Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 2% with comparable sales growth up 1% for the second quarter. April and May were the stronger months while trends lagged in June, particularly as we headed into the July 4th holiday weekend. That said, we're encouraged by the early trends thus far in July.  Growth was relatively consistent across our regions with the East and West regions recovering in the second quarter after the slow start to the year due to the impact from weather. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling, exhaust and ride control with strength in various core categories such as filters, batteries and fluids, all of which had growth above the U.S. average. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increases across most customer segments with fleet and government outperforming again this quarter with high single-digit growth. In Canada, sales grew approximately 6% in local currency during the second quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like heating and cooling, paint and body and tools and equipment, all of which were up double digits. Our automotive and heavy-duty businesses performed well, both posting mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter.  Our Canadian team executed well in the quarter, especially given the destructive wildfires across the country and we continue to see attractive opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals and share gain initiatives.  In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 15% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. We continue to drive strong growth and market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our key initiatives. For the second quarter, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. As our teams continue to win business with key accounts, drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. The team is on track to deliver EUR 400 million in sales of NAPA-branded products in 2023. In addition, we continue to strategically roll out our next Drive offering across our European markets that position our team to lead the industry in the growing EV aftermarket. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in Europe are tracking ahead of growth and synergy plans as we leverage our scale, integrate with discipline and expand margins. For example, comparable growth in our Iberian markets was approximately 25% during the second quarter, significantly ahead of our initial expectations.  In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 9% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with retail outpacing commercial in the second quarter. The team continues to strategically invest in the business to extend its customer value proposition. For example, the recent opening of distribution centers in Auckland, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia will drive long-term profitable growth and productivity.  We complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. We completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership positions and create long-term value.  In closing, the global GPC team delivered strong second quarter results, and we remain confident in our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. Our company is benefiting from our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Our teams remain focused to execute our strategic initiatives that deliver customer solutions and create value. We're committed to investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain and emerging technology that will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions.  Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and excellent performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nHerbert Nappier: Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams continue to operate at a high level and perform through this dynamic environment. And I'm pleased to walk you through the highlights of our second quarter performance.  Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the second quarter and 6 months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the sale of S.P. Richards Real Estate and the integration of KDG which represented a net $59 million benefit or $0.42 per diluted share. GPC revenues increased 5.6% or $313 million to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reflects a 4.9% improvement in comparable sales, including low single-digit to mid-single-digit levels in inflation and a 1.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 0.9% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The value and advantage of our balanced portfolio and global diversification was highlighted again as we delivered another quarterly sales record. Our gross margin was 36.1%, a 110 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year, driven by the ongoing favorable impact of our pricing and sourcing initiatives. We believe the execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin will continue to drive strong results. And for the full year, we now expect our gross margin rate to improve 30 to 50 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Our total operating and nonoperating expenses in the second quarter were $1.7 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and at 28.4% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.6% of sales in the second quarter last year or approximately 80 basis points of deleverage year-over-year. The deleverage in SG&A in the second quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, 2 of which were planned, our investments in wages and benefits for our teams and increased spending in technology. Our investments in the IT and digital initiatives we showcased at Investor Day, impacted SG&A by 20 basis points in the second quarter. In addition, planned investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by 30 basis points, much of this as a feat of inflationary pressure on wages. Finally, during the quarter, we recorded charges related to cost improvement actions at our U.S. automotive business and a true-up of stock compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees totaling 30 basis points, both of which we would not expect to repeat in the future. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points, driven by investments in our team members and IT. Our second quarter growth and gross margin improvement drove total segment profit of $613 million, up 11.8%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While we delivered strong overall margin expansion, margins in our Global Automotive segment were lower in Q2 due to pressure in our U.S. Automotive business. As we discussed in the first quarter, following the slow start to the year, we anticipated that the profitability of this business would remain challenged in the second quarter, and it did. However, our teams are making great progress as evidenced by the acceleration in the rate of gross margin expansion from the first quarter to the second quarter and the sequential improvement in segment margins. As Will mentioned earlier, we are executing cost improvement actions to address the elevated levels of operating costs in this business and to continue to improve profitability. We expect these actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business, and execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our second quarter net income was $344 million or $2.44 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 10.9%. This represents our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth and is a true testament to our team's hard work and continued focus to drive our profitability. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $457 million in cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2023. Recall that our cash flow in 2022 included a sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow was $252 million, and we closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. We remain well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities across GPC. Our key priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. And includes investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $205 million in capital expenditures, including $117 million in the second quarter. These investments continue to support the initiatives we believe will drive growth and the modernization of our business moving forward. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, and we invested $106 million year-to-date for acquisitions, and we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned $395 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $260 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $135 million in cash used to repurchase 841,000 shares. As we enter the second half of 2023, we are well positioned to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 20th. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $9.15 and to $9.30, an increase of approximately 10% to 11.5% from 2022. This represents a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance of $8.95 to $9.10. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with 4% to 6% comparable sales increase, and we continue to expect sales growth to moderate in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half of the year. Turning to a few other items of interest. Our guidance includes cash from operations in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others. Overall, we are very pleased with our first half results. Through this dynamic environment, our teams have demonstrated their ability to be agile while staying focused on serving our customers around the world. Our updated outlook for 2023 earnings per share reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and their ability to execute and drive solid results. We believe GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Paul for a few closing thoughts before we address your questions. Paul?\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Bert. Before we get into Q&A, we'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Sid Jones, who has announced his decision to retire from Genuine Parts Company after 33 years of service to the company. Sid has been leading our Investor Relations team since 2003 and today marks his 83rd quarterly earnings call at GPC in that role. We thank Sid his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the very best in his retirement. Tim Walsh has been working closely with Sid and the team for over a year and will be named Head of Investor Relations on August 1st. We look forward to having Tim in his new role and now he will do an exceptional job for us.  So with that, we are now ready for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Sid, you're going to be greatly missed. So we'll miss you a lot. Just a question on the U.S. automotive comp is plus 1%. You noted that globally, both DIY and -- for me were positive with DIFM outpacing DIY. Was that the case in the U.S. as well? You may have mentioned it and I missed it, I'm just not sure if you gave that detail for the U.S. in terms of DIY versus DIFM.\nWilliam Stengel: We did Liz, DIFM outperformed retail in the U.S. Automotive group for the quarter.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. Great. No, that's very helpful. And then just a question on the Industrial business. The margins have been really healthy there. I mean should we think about that 2Q operating margin is a decent run rate going forward? And is there any seasonality we should keep in mind that may have changed one way or another after the KDG acquisition?\nHerbert Nappier: Liz, it's Bert. I don't think you have on part to Q2 as the proxy for industrial for the full year. As you -- as we've commented, we see that industrial growth rate moderating here in the second half. Having said that, we still will get margin expansion for the full year on the Industrial segment. But we're thrilled with where the business performed in Q2 that 12.5% rate is a proxy for we can go long term as we shared at Investor Day, but we still have a lot of work to do to continue to grow that business and would use -- not use that as a proxy, but look to still see expansion of margin for the full year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Sid we will miss you very much, and congratulations on your retirement and all the best in your future endeavors. My first question is just following up on the U.S. -- the U.S. NAPA comp, I think you implied in April that you're maybe running about a 4 and you imply that June was down. So was June down sort of low to mid. And can you talk about what you're seeing that you're encouraged by in July and how you're thinking about U.S. NAPA comps in the back half?\nWilliam Stengel: Yes, Chris, happy to walk you through, and I'll maybe just kind of walk through some of the comments that we had in the prepared remarks. But so for U.S. automotive, April and May, as you noted were the stronger months in the quarter, low single-digit growth. The first half of June, in fact, was a solid start to the month, and we saw a tapering towards the end of the month that left June to be flattish, which puts together the 2 and then the 1 comp for the quarter, U.S. Automotive. We have seen an improvement to start the month in July. Obviously, we've had some extreme heat that is going to have a positive impact and -- while it's probably early to call the whole month, we're encouraged by the positive momentum plan to build on that through the quarter.  As Liz just asked, we saw outperformance and do-it-for-me versus retail, both growing in positive directions. And we continue to be bullish about our fleet and government segment, which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that grew nicely in the quarter. Good strength in filters, batteries and fluids, which are important categories for us. So we're excited about some of the things we're doing from a merchandising standpoint in those categories.  And I think it wasn't a total surprise to us given the weather patterns in the second quarter that some of our heating and cooling categories didn't perform the way we expected them to, just given. It wasn't an overly warm second quarter in the aggregate for the U.S. market. But we're excited about what we're working on in the business. Obviously, we think we've got more potential than we showed in the quarter. We're excited about Randy's leadership now in place here for the first couple of weeks. He's been out in the field working with the teams. I think there's a lot of energy and positive momentum there. Gross margin, as Bert talked about, continues to be a great piece of execution, both on the pricing and sourcing side of the house. Also very proud of the team and their quick adjustments to all things cost. So they're operating with a lot of intensity and focus. And importantly, we're investing in the business for the long term. So making sure that we're balancing near-term actions with long-term potential. So in the aggregate, a lot to be proud about the team. We're going to continue the grind and push through the second half of the year, but proud of what we're working on.\nPaul Donahue: And Chris, I would just tag on to that, that the fundamentals of the industry are still solid -- miles driven, going in the right direction as gas prices moderate a bit. New car sales being still a bit soft compared to historic numbers. And we're seeing the same across our international business as well. So as we reported our team in Europe had a phenomenal quarter, strong double-digit growth. Many of the fundamentals there, the same here across North America, rock solid. And our team in Asia Pac, Australia, New Zealand also had another really strong quarter. So fundamentals of automotive are still rock solid. And we certainly see improvement as we move forward through the back half of the year.\nChristopher Horvers: Sounds great. And then a follow-up question on the gross margin. I mean 36.1% is quite impressive. If you look back historically, the second quarter is a reasonable proxy for the year on gross margin. I know 1Q was a lot lower. But perhaps, was there anything unsustainable in the gross margin performance in the second quarter? And do you think over time, this is a level that is around 36% is sort of the destination? Or is it an area that perhaps you could even grow from?\nHerbert Nappier: Chris, it's Bert. Look, I think we had a great quarter here. In the past couple of quarters, I've given you the offsets for gross margin. We had a clean number this time around. We had no offsets from some of the things we've talked about in the past, whether it's inflation or mix. So we're just thrilled with the work that the team is doing and so important in this environment when we've got all the different economic pressures out there. So we've got a great focus on sourcing and getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time. We also have great work happening on pricing across all of the business. And so that 110 basis point improvement for the quarter up to 36.1%, I think is a reflection of really, really hard work.  We're going to continue to stay focused on gross margin expansion through those 2 prisms, through pricing and sourcing. I'm not going to call the bulges yet on where that number can ultimately end up. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're more bullish on where it can be for this year. We had originally been planning for 20 to 40 basis points of improvement, and we've got that to 30 to 50 basis points. Within that, again, benefit from the execution of our strategic initiatives. We do have a little bit of a benefit modeled in for ocean freight, which we see turning positive for us here in the second half. So those are the 2 things I'd call out with really no foreseen at this point impact from either FX or inflation or mix.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: I have a follow-up on Christopher's question. So the slowdown you've experienced in U.S. auto, do you think there's any share shifts occurring given some of the strong results we've seen from a few of your competitors or would you really just point to weather as the headwind in 2Q?\nWilliam Stengel: Yes, Scot, we don't think there's any share shifts. We always study the analytics. We use third-party independent information. We look at it by category and feel good about where we are. We act on that data every week and every month. We review it as a team and feel good about where we are. So no, we don't think that there's share loss happening here. We have specific strategies by category that we're executing against. And so the story can be quite different at a category level, but that's part of the science and art of all things, category management. So really proud of what the teams are working on. And as I said, we use independent data to keep ourselves honest to make sure that we're winning in the marketplace.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. So maybe some of the delta could be due to geographic differences potentially?\nWilliam Stengel: When you say geographic, you mean U.S. geography differences?\nScot Ciccarelli: Well, no. I mean, within the U.S., like your results, like if we had positive results from both DIY and commercial. And obviously, you had a 1% comp, like neither was up very strongly, right? So on -- specifically on the commercial side, like could we potentially attribute -- or did you potentially see like significant geographic differentiation in your business, stronger in the South, weaker in the West, what have you?\nWilliam Stengel: We really don't see a material difference across our regions. We've got 5 regions. The growth rates are not materially different. There's always region specific customers and dynamics. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a recovery in the Northeast and West, which we planned and expected based on their slow start driven by weather, we saw that come to bear. And for the second quarter, though, by themselves, there's not a material difference by region.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. And then just a quick housekeeping item. The $80 million or so that you guys highlighted for cost actions and the stock comp true-up. Were they the main drivers in the spike of corporate expense? And should we expect that line item to moderate in the back half?\nHerbert Nappier: Scot, it's Bert. I'll take that one. Look, we did have an increase in the corporate expense as a result of the 2 items you noted, one on the stock comp true-up and the other on the cost actions. The other thing contributing to corporate, and this is a little obscured in the 10-Q, but if you take a chance to read through the 10-Q, you get some good color on that either from the first quarter or the one that will be filed later today.  We transferred some functions at the beginning of this year into the corporate environment that we felt were better suited to be run on a more consolidated basis, one of them being cyber security and our work around cybersecurity globally. We did a little bit of that related to some of the finance functions and also our management of our product liability cases and litigation. When we did that, we actually got a benefit so far this year in terms of being ahead of where those items were being spent last year. But it did create a transfer left pocket, right pocket, which makes the corporate number look a little bit bigger. We're still guiding for the year of corporate expense in the $300 million to $325 million range. Longer term, we target for that to be about 1% of revenue. It's up this year because of those transfers and we'll look up for the full year. But like I said, we're already seeing the benefit of the move of centralization by streamlining those functions and seeing them operate at a lower cost rates than they had in the past.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. But some of the margin expansion that we've seen at the segment level is because of that cost transfer, just to be clear.\nHerbert Nappier: Yes, it's pretty small there, Scot. I mean we're talking about costs totaling year-to-date, $29 million in the aggregate. So it's a pretty small move. It stands out at corporate a little bit bigger because of the size and scale of the corporate expense line. But it's very negligible at the segment level.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.\nBret Jordan: Congrats to Sid and Randy. Randy now that you run them both, I guess, where do you see the biggest opportunity industrial or auto in the U.S. in the next, say, 2, 3 years?\nWilliam Stengel: Bret, the good news is Randy is not on the call with us, but that's a tough question for him to answer. He loves both these businesses now. He's been out in the field and has a ton of energy and excited about the opportunities in front of us. So...\nBret Jordan: I was going to ask you what you like better, but I figure out you too.\nWilliam Stengel: He wouldn't have answered that question? He like them both.\nPaul Donahue: Which one is your favorite kids, you know, Bret?\nBret Jordan: That's easy. Question on price, I guess. We were talking about sort of low mid-single-digit benefit from inflation in Q2. How do you see the second half cadence? The bar gets higher, I guess, year-over-year, but maybe you've got some incremental price passing along some of the rate inflation from your suppliers. How do we think about the organic price comp second half?\nHerbert Nappier: Yes. Bret. I'll take that one, it's Bert. On inflation, I'll kind of start at a high level. As we expected, we saw inflation moderate again in Q2, and I think really falling in line with our original thinking as we started the year, monetary policy in the U.S. and around the world, I think it's having its desired effect. You can see that in the U.S. CPI data. Just to reiterate, for the quarter -- second quarter inflation with low single digits all up for GPC, mid-single digits in auto, and low single digits for industrial. That industrial number has stayed pretty consistently in that low single-digit range for the year. Auto ticked down from high single digit to mid-single digit. And then on the whole, GPC has ticked down from mid-single digit to low single digits. So really falling right in line with what we thought when we started out the year. We're seeing some inflationary pressure on operating expenses, particularly in wages, and that was in my prepared remarks. That's sitting in the mid-single-digit range right now. It's probably the most pronounced impact in the business, but we're managing it. We're doing all the right things and taking some actions to try to offset that. And I think that's not a GPC-specific comment, it's a comment that all businesses are facing with wage pressure and inflation and wages.  As we look ahead, we think inflation will continue to moderate throughout 2023. And I think policy will continue to have its desired effect. Auto will tick down from high single digits to start the year to low single digits to close out the year. And industrial is going to bounce along that low single digits for the full year. We'll see GPC close out in the aggregate from a mid-single digit to a low single-digit. So it's not a one-size-fits-all for our business segments, but hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we're thinking about the rest of the year. And that's all factored into our guidance and our update to the guidance for the year.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then one follow-up on another pricing question. I guess one of your auto peers reported pretty rough Q1 and talked about price competition in the market. I guess could you comment about what you see, I guess, from pure pricing, any cadence of change in pricing in year-to-date '23?\nPaul Donahue: Yes. I'll take a shot at that, Bret. And then maybe Will can tag on what perhaps more specific thought. Look, first and foremost, I'd say we're not going to speak to specific strategies of our competitors. We got a lot of respect for our peers and they're doing what they've got to do for their business. What I would tell you, the competitive landscape, the dynamics are still rational. We play in huge markets, as outlined by Will. We've got lots of different competitors across all those markets, both big and small. What we really spend our time thinking about, Bret, and you won't -- this is not new news. It's about inventory availability. Ensuring we've got the right people in the right markets, ensuring we've got our store footprint -- the right store footprint to cover all of our strategic markets and allowing us to continue to grow profitably. We're in a break-fix model and helping our customers really solve their problems quickly with the right part in the right market at the right price. It's all part of our value prop. That hasn't changed, Bret. And honestly, I don't see that changing anytime soon. Do we think about price? Sure, we do. But right now, our customers are really more focused on ensuring they can be productive in their shops. That they're taking care of their customers. And we think we're a pretty good partner not only here in North America, but around the world to solve those challenges for them. So Will, I don't know if there's anything else from a pricing environment that you would want to comment on?\nWilliam Stengel: Well, I would just say, operationally, what the teams are working on is incredibly helpful in this environment as it has been for the last couple of years, hence, the investment and focus on it. And more importantly, the teams globally are learning from each other. And so I think in one of our previous calls, we've talked about all the great work that's happening in U.S. automotive. We're sharing that work over in Europe.  And so these are some of the benefits of working together as a team and sharing all the learnings from an environment that's very similar around the world and gross margin performance in the total company. I think, is a good data point to suggest that we're having some success. So it's an important part of distribution business and it's especially important part of navigating this environment, and we're going to continue to get better at it and invest in it so that we can make the right decisions for our customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.\nGregory Melich: I wanted to -- one question on the U.S. auto business and then follow-up on industrial guidance. I just want to understand a little bit better with that inflation number, I think we're still seeing mid-single digits. Would it be fair to say a 1 comp would translate into negative 4 units. And then could you give us a little more color on the non-fleet and government business, how the independent dealers did and how NAPA AutoCare did?\nWilliam Stengel: Yes, Greg. So I don't -- it's not as simple as minus 4% because we got to do it for me in retail. So you've got a distinction on transactions there. So do it for me, positive transaction and price, do it yourself as expected, transactions down tick it up. So in the aggregate, that's a little bit more noisy than just the minus 4%. On the other parts of the business, the AutoCare business continues to perform well. Obviously, our value prop with that segment is incredibly important and it's a challenging time. So partnering with them to make sure that they're being productive and navigating the environment. So that was a part of the business that performed to our expectations.  Major accounts is a very customer-specific book of business. So there are some pockets of strength in that book of business as well as some areas of opportunity. I would reinforce our philosophy here that it's really important that we think about partners and growing our business through the medium term in a profitable way. And so I think we're going to bring a lot of discipline and rigor to thinking about the trade-offs between profitable share and not in our major account business. So in the aggregate, a bit of a mixed story, but positive in total.\nGregory Melich: Did the company stores do materially different than the jobbers?\nWilliam Stengel: We didn't see a material difference in the performance. It was pretty close to each other. And...\nGregory Melich: Yes, okay. Just maybe DIY, do-it-for-me mix a little bit, but no difference in that cut. The -- I guess the follow-up is on industrial. I just want to make sure I got that right. I mean, with obviously the big numbers continue to come through it. But the margin, the 12.5% margin, I just want to make sure I'm not -- do we assume that industrial margins will actually be down in the back half or that was -- they'll still be up for the year? Was that -- interpret that wrong, Bert?\nHerbert Nappier: Yes. Actually, you did interpret it wrong. But let me back it up and maybe pull it up and give a little color on guidance in general, and I'll work my way back down to segment margins. As you can expect, we're pleased with the first half performance on an overall basis, allowed us to raise our outlook again for the year this time by $0.20 to the $9.15 to $9.30.  And in doing that, we see some upside in industrial profitability versus our previous expectations, the international automotive business, which is about 50% of the segment revenue for global automotive, we see some upside. And then obviously, we've taken up our gross margin performance expectations. That guidance delivers EPS growth with a midpoint of 10.6%, and that's putting us in a position to expect our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, which in this environment, is, we think, pretty impressive. On a growth basis, top line, we had exceptional '21 and '22. We still see strong growth but moderated growth to mid-single digits overall for this year. And that really, as we look at a pretty choppy macro environment and difficult to interpret we're keeping an eye on some of these things that are out there, whether it's inflation, monetary policy, interest rates, the political landscape globally and foreign currency.  So we're keeping a close eye on all of that. We balance that against confidence in our own business. Paul talked about strong industry fundamentals. We've got some great cash flows that allow us to invest in our business. And taking that all together, while it's a little bit more cautious, we do have a lot of confidence in GPC. A few details just to remember, again, gross margin, we've ticked up to 30 to 50 basis point increase expectation versus our original 20 to 40 basis points.  On segment margins, we're looking for those to be up for the full year, 20 to 40 basis points. That's expansion again. We do think industrial will be up for the year. So just to clarify, Industrial will be up for the year, but not using the 12.5% for Q2 of the proxy. Industrial segment margin will outpace automotive, but we believe automotive will be in a position to recover here in the second half, as Will outlined. The only point I would call out on just a headwind is SG&A. We will see deleverage as we expected for the year 30 to 40 basis points, which is consistent with our original expectations. So all that together allowed us to take our guidance up for the year slightly better on international auto, industrial profit conversion and better gross margin expectations.\nGregory Melich: Got it. Thanks for piecing that together. And I guess I will say said, thanks for everything, and I didn't realize 83 quarters you must have started in college. So...\nSidney Jones: All right, I lead them up too easy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephen Bank.\nDaniel Imbro: Sid, I'll add my congratulations to the group. Well deserved -- working together. Well, I want to start on the U.S. auto side, maybe taking a step back from the quarter, just more strategically, obviously, with the promotion of Randy to the new responsibility, can you talk about what's the strategy is there, maybe bringing Motion and auto under singular leadership rather than kind of running separately. Is that a reflection of running the businesses closer together? Is that just a personnel decision? Can you talk to me about how you view that? And you mentioned some early positive internal response. Can you share any more color on what that's been.\nWilliam Stengel: Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy is a proven leader. He is well understood by our organization and brings a lot of relevant expertise to the NAPA business. As we've talked about often, at the end of the day, these are distribution businesses. And while -- they obviously have a different customer and product catalog. The value creation initiatives are all the same. And so Randy's progress and momentum and building a great team there at Motion that is incredibly deep, I think, it's all relevant and has spoken for itself in terms of the performance. And so I think it's more about how do we quickly build on the momentum of the business. And I think Randy brings is a great opportunity to do that.  So I don't think it's operationally, meaning that we're putting the 2 business. In fact, I know it's not. We're not putting the businesses together, but I think it's just going to allow us to be a little bit more efficient and at pace to work together as kind of a One GPC team, which is a philosophy that we've been talking about as an organization. And I think an advantage that we have, given the similarities of all the initiatives that we're doing around the world to go at pace and drive impact faster than perhaps if we were not together as a company.\nPaul Donahue: Daniel, I would just add to Will's comments, Randy has done a phenomenal job at Motion as you've seen in the numbers, and we expect that to continue because we've got a great leadership team at Motion. And as you know, every business, it's much bigger than one person.  I would say the same by U.S. automotive, Daniel. And I'm glad you asked the question because it gives me the opportunity to recognize that team. Kevin did a great job over the last few years of really bringing in a lot of new talent into the leadership group at U.S. Automotive. That team, I have 100% confidence, it is going to continue to drive improvements in U.S. automotive. And I have no doubt Randy will continue on with the good work that Kevin did by leading that team. So we're excited by the moves and look forward to the impact that Randy is going to have across both businesses.\nDaniel Imbro: And then follow up on the automotive guidance, not to get too into it, but trying to reconcile the 4% to 6% comp guide and the 4% to 6% total revenue guide on the automotive side. I think FX rates just as we sit today are at least a few points better than what you initially guided. So trying to reconcile how that wouldn't be more of a tailwind. Are you hedging out some of that translational benefit in the back half? Or is the right interpretation, it will be more FX benefit? And maybe lighter organic growth just within that same guidance range. Just trying to square away how FX rates can change the guide, kind of gets maintained.\nHerbert Nappier: Yes, sure. Look, on the top line, I think we've been consistent pretty much throughout the year with our initial outlook on the top line guide. And we've just basically done what we said we would do on both with the 4% to 6%. As we look at the rest of the year through de-comping and trying to get a little bit more color on global automotive I would say that the international automotive will continue to outpace the U.S. We'll expect it to be on the higher end of our comp range. We'll expect the U.S. to be on the lower end.  So the international is a bit on the higher end, you probably get a little bit of improvement from FX to your point, but that's kind of how we're thinking about those things. And look, in the U.S. automotive business, as Will has highlighted, there's more potential there. But we are being a little bit conservative on how we think about the rest of the year and how that business recovers and continues to improve over the second half. On industrial, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the industrial side. They've had a fantastic first half. But as we expect in the second half, moderates a bit to low single digits in the second half versus high single digits in the first half, which gives you the 4% to 6% for industrial. But even with that low single-digit. As I've said a couple of times, we will see some nice margin expansion for the full year in the Industrial segment. So hopefully, that reconciles that and squares the circle for you.\nDaniel Imbro: Just one follow-up on the comp guide. You just mentioned you called the back half conservative on the outlook. But in the U.S., you're calling for an acceleration. Inflation is moderating. So clearly, you're implying traffic is going to further accelerate to get the total comp up. I guess, what are the specific buckets? Or what are you looking at in the business that gives you guys the confidence that the traffic will be ultimately accelerating from here through the back half of the year to get that acceleration towards the low end of the 4% to 6% comp guide in the U.S.\nHerbert Nappier: Yes. I'm not sure I would have interpreted that way. I'll just reiterate kind of what we're thinking. As we look at the 4% to 6% for the back half for automotive. We've had consistent growth throughout the year on the 4% to 6% range. We expect that for the next 2 quarters, full year automotive at 4% to 6%. International on the higher end and U.S. automotive on the lower end of that range, and I think we'll just leave it there.\nOperator: We have time for one last question, and that question will come from Seth Basham of Wedbush.\nSeth Basham: Congrats to Sid as well, we'll miss you buddy. My question, not to beat a dead horse is back on the U.S. auto business and the cadence of comps through the quarter. Perhaps we were mistaken, Will. But I thought on the last quarterly conference call, you said that April to date had accelerated from the 3% level in the first quarter. That implies a pretty material deceleration through the balance of the quarter, he said zero-ish, flattish in June. Where were we in April and May?\nWilliam Stengel: I think the comment that we made in the first call was true. In April, we did accelerate from the March performance. And as you articulated, and as I think we said, April and May were close to each other in this quarter and then June was the deceleration, and we called it flattish. So call it low single digit, low single digit, flattish for the quarter.\nSeth Basham: All right. Fair enough. And then secondly, just following up on your comments regarding the major accounts segment. Seems like that's the segment where there's the most price competition, you're being more disciplined with how you approach some customers there. Can you give us any more color? Are you walking away from some business that you don't see as being profitable enough at this point in time?\nWilliam Stengel: I'm not sure I'd go that far. I would say, first and foremost, this part of the business is always discussing price, obviously, because they're big scale accounts. So I wouldn't say that those types of discussions are more intense today than they were before. I think we're just bringing a fresh perspective to making sure that our value prop is being appreciated. And we're also doing work with smaller regional \"major accounts\" that we can really drive a lot of value with given all the capabilities that we bring to them. So I think it's just a stepped-up level of focus and strategic discipline about taking care of our customers.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thank you. And I just want to reiterate, we are super proud of our team, the way they continue to operate and in a challenging environment around the world. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today, and thanks for your combined and continued interest in Genuine Parts Company.  We'll look forward to hosting another call in the third quarter and report on our results. So we'll have another call on October 19th. In the meantime, stay cool and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Herbert Nappier",
            "content": "Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams continue to operate at a high level and perform through this dynamic environment. And I'm pleased to walk you through the highlights of our second quarter performance.  Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the second quarter and 6 months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the sale of S.P. Richards Real Estate and the integration of KDG which represented a net $59 million benefit or $0.42 per diluted share. GPC revenues increased 5.6% or $313 million to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reflects a 4.9% improvement in comparable sales, including low single-digit to mid-single-digit levels in inflation and a 1.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 0.9% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The value and advantage of our balanced portfolio and global diversification was highlighted again as we delivered another quarterly sales record. Our gross margin was 36.1%, a 110 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year, driven by the ongoing favorable impact of our pricing and sourcing initiatives. We believe the execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin will continue to drive strong results. And for the full year, we now expect our gross margin rate to improve 30 to 50 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Our total operating and nonoperating expenses in the second quarter were $1.7 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and at 28.4% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.6% of sales in the second quarter last year or approximately 80 basis points of deleverage year-over-year. The deleverage in SG&A in the second quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, 2 of which were planned, our investments in wages and benefits for our teams and increased spending in technology. Our investments in the IT and digital initiatives we showcased at Investor Day, impacted SG&A by 20 basis points in the second quarter. In addition, planned investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&A by 30 basis points, much of this as a feat of inflationary pressure on wages. Finally, during the quarter, we recorded charges related to cost improvement actions at our U.S. automotive business and a true-up of stock compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees totaling 30 basis points, both of which we would not expect to repeat in the future. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points, driven by investments in our team members and IT. Our second quarter growth and gross margin improvement drove total segment profit of $613 million, up 11.8%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While we delivered strong overall margin expansion, margins in our Global Automotive segment were lower in Q2 due to pressure in our U.S. Automotive business. As we discussed in the first quarter, following the slow start to the year, we anticipated that the profitability of this business would remain challenged in the second quarter, and it did. However, our teams are making great progress as evidenced by the acceleration in the rate of gross margin expansion from the first quarter to the second quarter and the sequential improvement in segment margins. As Will mentioned earlier, we are executing cost improvement actions to address the elevated levels of operating costs in this business and to continue to improve profitability. We expect these actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business, and execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our second quarter net income was $344 million or $2.44 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 10.9%. This represents our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth and is a true testament to our team's hard work and continued focus to drive our profitability. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $457 million in cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2023. Recall that our cash flow in 2022 included a sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow was $252 million, and we closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. We remain well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities across GPC. Our key priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. And includes investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During 2023, we have invested $205 million in capital expenditures, including $117 million in the second quarter. These investments continue to support the initiatives we believe will drive growth and the modernization of our business moving forward. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, and we invested $106 million year-to-date for acquisitions, and we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses. Thus far in 2023, we have also returned $395 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $260 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $135 million in cash used to repurchase 841,000 shares. As we enter the second half of 2023, we are well positioned to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 20th. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $9.15 and to $9.30, an increase of approximately 10% to 11.5% from 2022. This represents a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance of $8.95 to $9.10. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with 4% to 6% comparable sales increase, and we continue to expect sales growth to moderate in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half of the year. Turning to a few other items of interest. Our guidance includes cash from operations in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others. Overall, we are very pleased with our first half results. Through this dynamic environment, our teams have demonstrated their ability to be agile while staying focused on serving our customers around the world. Our updated outlook for 2023 earnings per share reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and their ability to execute and drive solid results. We believe GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Paul for a few closing thoughts before we address your questions. Paul? Liz, it's Bert. I don't think you have on part to Q2 as the proxy for industrial for the full year. As you -- as we've commented, we see that industrial growth rate moderating here in the second half. Having said that, we still will get margin expansion for the full year on the Industrial segment. But we're thrilled with where the business performed in Q2 that 12.5% rate is a proxy for we can go long term as we shared at Investor Day, but we still have a lot of work to do to continue to grow that business and would use -- not use that as a proxy, but look to still see expansion of margin for the full year. Chris, it's Bert. Look, I think we had a great quarter here. In the past couple of quarters, I've given you the offsets for gross margin. We had a clean number this time around. We had no offsets from some of the things we've talked about in the past, whether it's inflation or mix. So we're just thrilled with the work that the team is doing and so important in this environment when we've got all the different economic pressures out there. So we've got a great focus on sourcing and getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time. We also have great work happening on pricing across all of the business. And so that 110 basis point improvement for the quarter up to 36.1%, I think is a reflection of really, really hard work.  We're going to continue to stay focused on gross margin expansion through those 2 prisms, through pricing and sourcing. I'm not going to call the bulges yet on where that number can ultimately end up. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're more bullish on where it can be for this year. We had originally been planning for 20 to 40 basis points of improvement, and we've got that to 30 to 50 basis points. Within that, again, benefit from the execution of our strategic initiatives. We do have a little bit of a benefit modeled in for ocean freight, which we see turning positive for us here in the second half. So those are the 2 things I'd call out with really no foreseen at this point impact from either FX or inflation or mix. Scot, it's Bert. I'll take that one. Look, we did have an increase in the corporate expense as a result of the 2 items you noted, one on the stock comp true-up and the other on the cost actions. The other thing contributing to corporate, and this is a little obscured in the 10-Q, but if you take a chance to read through the 10-Q, you get some good color on that either from the first quarter or the one that will be filed later today.  We transferred some functions at the beginning of this year into the corporate environment that we felt were better suited to be run on a more consolidated basis, one of them being cyber security and our work around cybersecurity globally. We did a little bit of that related to some of the finance functions and also our management of our product liability cases and litigation. When we did that, we actually got a benefit so far this year in terms of being ahead of where those items were being spent last year. But it did create a transfer left pocket, right pocket, which makes the corporate number look a little bit bigger. We're still guiding for the year of corporate expense in the $300 million to $325 million range. Longer term, we target for that to be about 1% of revenue. It's up this year because of those transfers and we'll look up for the full year. But like I said, we're already seeing the benefit of the move of centralization by streamlining those functions and seeing them operate at a lower cost rates than they had in the past. Yes, it's pretty small there, Scot. I mean we're talking about costs totaling year-to-date, $29 million in the aggregate. So it's a pretty small move. It stands out at corporate a little bit bigger because of the size and scale of the corporate expense line. But it's very negligible at the segment level. Yes. Bret. I'll take that one, it's Bert. On inflation, I'll kind of start at a high level. As we expected, we saw inflation moderate again in Q2, and I think really falling in line with our original thinking as we started the year, monetary policy in the U.S. and around the world, I think it's having its desired effect. You can see that in the U.S. CPI data. Just to reiterate, for the quarter -- second quarter inflation with low single digits all up for GPC, mid-single digits in auto, and low single digits for industrial. That industrial number has stayed pretty consistently in that low single-digit range for the year. Auto ticked down from high single digit to mid-single digit. And then on the whole, GPC has ticked down from mid-single digit to low single digits. So really falling right in line with what we thought when we started out the year. We're seeing some inflationary pressure on operating expenses, particularly in wages, and that was in my prepared remarks. That's sitting in the mid-single-digit range right now. It's probably the most pronounced impact in the business, but we're managing it. We're doing all the right things and taking some actions to try to offset that. And I think that's not a GPC-specific comment, it's a comment that all businesses are facing with wage pressure and inflation and wages.  As we look ahead, we think inflation will continue to moderate throughout 2023. And I think policy will continue to have its desired effect. Auto will tick down from high single digits to start the year to low single digits to close out the year. And industrial is going to bounce along that low single digits for the full year. We'll see GPC close out in the aggregate from a mid-single digit to a low single-digit. So it's not a one-size-fits-all for our business segments, but hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we're thinking about the rest of the year. And that's all factored into our guidance and our update to the guidance for the year. Yes. Actually, you did interpret it wrong. But let me back it up and maybe pull it up and give a little color on guidance in general, and I'll work my way back down to segment margins. As you can expect, we're pleased with the first half performance on an overall basis, allowed us to raise our outlook again for the year this time by $0.20 to the $9.15 to $9.30.  And in doing that, we see some upside in industrial profitability versus our previous expectations, the international automotive business, which is about 50% of the segment revenue for global automotive, we see some upside. And then obviously, we've taken up our gross margin performance expectations. That guidance delivers EPS growth with a midpoint of 10.6%, and that's putting us in a position to expect our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, which in this environment, is, we think, pretty impressive. On a growth basis, top line, we had exceptional '21 and '22. We still see strong growth but moderated growth to mid-single digits overall for this year. And that really, as we look at a pretty choppy macro environment and difficult to interpret we're keeping an eye on some of these things that are out there, whether it's inflation, monetary policy, interest rates, the political landscape globally and foreign currency.  So we're keeping a close eye on all of that. We balance that against confidence in our own business. Paul talked about strong industry fundamentals. We've got some great cash flows that allow us to invest in our business. And taking that all together, while it's a little bit more cautious, we do have a lot of confidence in GPC. A few details just to remember, again, gross margin, we've ticked up to 30 to 50 basis point increase expectation versus our original 20 to 40 basis points.  On segment margins, we're looking for those to be up for the full year, 20 to 40 basis points. That's expansion again. We do think industrial will be up for the year. So just to clarify, Industrial will be up for the year, but not using the 12.5% for Q2 of the proxy. Industrial segment margin will outpace automotive, but we believe automotive will be in a position to recover here in the second half, as Will outlined. The only point I would call out on just a headwind is SG&A. We will see deleverage as we expected for the year 30 to 40 basis points, which is consistent with our original expectations. So all that together allowed us to take our guidance up for the year slightly better on international auto, industrial profit conversion and better gross margin expectations. Yes, sure. Look, on the top line, I think we've been consistent pretty much throughout the year with our initial outlook on the top line guide. And we've just basically done what we said we would do on both with the 4% to 6%. As we look at the rest of the year through de-comping and trying to get a little bit more color on global automotive I would say that the international automotive will continue to outpace the U.S. We'll expect it to be on the higher end of our comp range. We'll expect the U.S. to be on the lower end.  So the international is a bit on the higher end, you probably get a little bit of improvement from FX to your point, but that's kind of how we're thinking about those things. And look, in the U.S. automotive business, as Will has highlighted, there's more potential there. But we are being a little bit conservative on how we think about the rest of the year and how that business recovers and continues to improve over the second half. On industrial, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the industrial side. They've had a fantastic first half. But as we expect in the second half, moderates a bit to low single digits in the second half versus high single digits in the first half, which gives you the 4% to 6% for industrial. But even with that low single-digit. As I've said a couple of times, we will see some nice margin expansion for the full year in the Industrial segment. So hopefully, that reconciles that and squares the circle for you. Yes. I'm not sure I would have interpreted that way. I'll just reiterate kind of what we're thinking. As we look at the 4% to 6% for the back half for automotive. We've had consistent growth throughout the year on the 4% to 6% range. We expect that for the next 2 quarters, full year automotive at 4% to 6%. International on the higher end and U.S. automotive on the lower end of that range, and I think we'll just leave it there."

            "name": "William Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate all the hard work to take care of our customers every day with solutions that help keep the world moving. We do this with focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. We work together as One GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value. On behalf of the entire GPC team, we would like to congratulate Kevin Herron on his well-deserved retirement after an amazing 34-year career at the company. Kevin earned success in all of his roles over the years, including the last 5 years as President of the U.S. Automotive business. He embodies our GPC values and he's been an inspirational leader and mentor to many around the world. We're deeply grateful for his significant contributions to Genuine Parts Company and wish him the very best in his retirement. With Kevin's retirement, we also want to congratulate Randy Breaux on his promotion to Group President, GPC North America effective July 1st. In the new role, Randy will oversee both the automotive and industrial businesses across North America, while assuming day-to-day responsibility as President of the U.S. Automotive Group. Randy is a proven leader with a track record of performance. His relevant expertise across distribution industries, familiarity with GPC teammates and stakeholders and success at Motion make him the ideal candidate for the role. This transition represents the depth of our leadership team and our talent strategies as we continue to leverage the power of One GPC. Now turning to our 2 business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an increase of $125 million or 5.9%. Comparable sales growth increased 6.0% in the second quarter versus last year. The cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with April being the strongest month followed by mid-single-digit growth in both May and June. The sales growth at Motion was broad-based again in the second quarter, with all product categories and major industries served posting positive gains from the prior year. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, iron and steel, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to make excellent progress with its initiatives including inside and outside sales, pricing, e-commerce, growth-focused tech and supply chain strategies, they're all helping to win profitable market share. As an example, Motion has seen a nearly twofold increase in average daily sales across its e-commerce platform since 2021, which now represent nearly 30% of total Motion daily sales. In Asia Pac, our Motion business also delivered strong performance in the second quarter with double-digit sales and profit growth. Customer-centric initiatives across talent and culture, inventory availability and operational excellence are delivering positive results. Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $283 million or 12.5% of sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in Industrial was driven by excellent operating rigor in both North America and Australasia and the disciplined execution of strategic initiatives. In addition, the Motion North America team continues to realize synergies related to the KDG acquisition. The team is substantially complete with the branch consolidation and merger efforts well ahead of initial plans. And we expect to exceed our 3-year $50 million synergy commitment by the end of this year, also well ahead of initial plans. Turning to Global Automotive. Total sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.4% versus the same period in 2022. Similar to the first quarter, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the U.S. posted mid-single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased 4.3%, ranging from low single-digit growth in the U.S. to low double-digit growth in Europe. We saw global automotive sales inflation moderate from high single-digit growth in the first quarter to low to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable fundamentals and solid team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth. Global Automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $329 million, up 2.1% versus the same period in 2022. And segment operating margin was 9.0% compared to 9.3% in 2022. As expected, Automotive's margin showed an improvement versus the first quarter. The improvement in the second quarter reflects the impact of the cost actions implemented at U.S. Automotive, and we expect to see an increased benefit of these actions in the second half of the year.  Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 2% with comparable sales growth up 1% for the second quarter. April and May were the stronger months while trends lagged in June, particularly as we headed into the July 4th holiday weekend. That said, we're encouraged by the early trends thus far in July.  Growth was relatively consistent across our regions with the East and West regions recovering in the second quarter after the slow start to the year due to the impact from weather. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling, exhaust and ride control with strength in various core categories such as filters, batteries and fluids, all of which had growth above the U.S. average. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increases across most customer segments with fleet and government outperforming again this quarter with high single-digit growth. In Canada, sales grew approximately 6% in local currency during the second quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like heating and cooling, paint and body and tools and equipment, all of which were up double digits. Our automotive and heavy-duty businesses performed well, both posting mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter.  Our Canadian team executed well in the quarter, especially given the destructive wildfires across the country and we continue to see attractive opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals and share gain initiatives.  In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 15% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. We continue to drive strong growth and market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our key initiatives. For the second quarter, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. As our teams continue to win business with key accounts, drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. The team is on track to deliver EUR 400 million in sales of NAPA-branded products in 2023. In addition, we continue to strategically roll out our next Drive offering across our European markets that position our team to lead the industry in the growing EV aftermarket. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in Europe are tracking ahead of growth and synergy plans as we leverage our scale, integrate with discipline and expand margins. For example, comparable growth in our Iberian markets was approximately 25% during the second quarter, significantly ahead of our initial expectations.  In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 9% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with retail outpacing commercial in the second quarter. The team continues to strategically invest in the business to extend its customer value proposition. For example, the recent opening of distribution centers in Auckland, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia will drive long-term profitable growth and productivity.  We complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. We completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership positions and create long-term value.  In closing, the global GPC team delivered strong second quarter results, and we remain confident in our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. Our company is benefiting from our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Our teams remain focused to execute our strategic initiatives that deliver customer solutions and create value. We're committed to investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain and emerging technology that will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions.  Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and excellent performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. We did Liz, DIFM outperformed retail in the U.S. Automotive group for the quarter. Yes, Chris, happy to walk you through, and I'll maybe just kind of walk through some of the comments that we had in the prepared remarks. But so for U.S. automotive, April and May, as you noted were the stronger months in the quarter, low single-digit growth. The first half of June, in fact, was a solid start to the month, and we saw a tapering towards the end of the month that left June to be flattish, which puts together the 2 and then the 1 comp for the quarter, U.S. Automotive. We have seen an improvement to start the month in July. Obviously, we've had some extreme heat that is going to have a positive impact and -- while it's probably early to call the whole month, we're encouraged by the positive momentum plan to build on that through the quarter.  As Liz just asked, we saw outperformance and do-it-for-me versus retail, both growing in positive directions. And we continue to be bullish about our fleet and government segment, which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that grew nicely in the quarter. Good strength in filters, batteries and fluids, which are important categories for us. So we're excited about some of the things we're doing from a merchandising standpoint in those categories.  And I think it wasn't a total surprise to us given the weather patterns in the second quarter that some of our heating and cooling categories didn't perform the way we expected them to, just given. It wasn't an overly warm second quarter in the aggregate for the U.S. market. But we're excited about what we're working on in the business. Obviously, we think we've got more potential than we showed in the quarter. We're excited about Randy's leadership now in place here for the first couple of weeks. He's been out in the field working with the teams. I think there's a lot of energy and positive momentum there. Gross margin, as Bert talked about, continues to be a great piece of execution, both on the pricing and sourcing side of the house. Also very proud of the team and their quick adjustments to all things cost. So they're operating with a lot of intensity and focus. And importantly, we're investing in the business for the long term. So making sure that we're balancing near-term actions with long-term potential. So in the aggregate, a lot to be proud about the team. We're going to continue the grind and push through the second half of the year, but proud of what we're working on. Yes, Scot, we don't think there's any share shifts. We always study the analytics. We use third-party independent information. We look at it by category and feel good about where we are. We act on that data every week and every month. We review it as a team and feel good about where we are. So no, we don't think that there's share loss happening here. We have specific strategies by category that we're executing against. And so the story can be quite different at a category level, but that's part of the science and art of all things, category management. So really proud of what the teams are working on. And as I said, we use independent data to keep ourselves honest to make sure that we're winning in the marketplace. When you say geographic, you mean U.S. geography differences? We really don't see a material difference across our regions. We've got 5 regions. The growth rates are not materially different. There's always region specific customers and dynamics. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a recovery in the Northeast and West, which we planned and expected based on their slow start driven by weather, we saw that come to bear. And for the second quarter, though, by themselves, there's not a material difference by region. Bret, the good news is Randy is not on the call with us, but that's a tough question for him to answer. He loves both these businesses now. He's been out in the field and has a ton of energy and excited about the opportunities in front of us. So... He wouldn't have answered that question? He like them both. Well, I would just say, operationally, what the teams are working on is incredibly helpful in this environment as it has been for the last couple of years, hence, the investment and focus on it. And more importantly, the teams globally are learning from each other. And so I think in one of our previous calls, we've talked about all the great work that's happening in U.S. automotive. We're sharing that work over in Europe.  And so these are some of the benefits of working together as a team and sharing all the learnings from an environment that's very similar around the world and gross margin performance in the total company. I think, is a good data point to suggest that we're having some success. So it's an important part of distribution business and it's especially important part of navigating this environment, and we're going to continue to get better at it and invest in it so that we can make the right decisions for our customers. Yes, Greg. So I don't -- it's not as simple as minus 4% because we got to do it for me in retail. So you've got a distinction on transactions there. So do it for me, positive transaction and price, do it yourself as expected, transactions down tick it up. So in the aggregate, that's a little bit more noisy than just the minus 4%. On the other parts of the business, the AutoCare business continues to perform well. Obviously, our value prop with that segment is incredibly important and it's a challenging time. So partnering with them to make sure that they're being productive and navigating the environment. So that was a part of the business that performed to our expectations.  Major accounts is a very customer-specific book of business. So there are some pockets of strength in that book of business as well as some areas of opportunity. I would reinforce our philosophy here that it's really important that we think about partners and growing our business through the medium term in a profitable way. And so I think we're going to bring a lot of discipline and rigor to thinking about the trade-offs between profitable share and not in our major account business. So in the aggregate, a bit of a mixed story, but positive in total. We didn't see a material difference in the performance. It was pretty close to each other. And... Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy is a proven leader. He is well understood by our organization and brings a lot of relevant expertise to the NAPA business. As we've talked about often, at the end of the day, these are distribution businesses. And while -- they obviously have a different customer and product catalog. The value creation initiatives are all the same. And so Randy's progress and momentum and building a great team there at Motion that is incredibly deep, I think, it's all relevant and has spoken for itself in terms of the performance. And so I think it's more about how do we quickly build on the momentum of the business. And I think Randy brings is a great opportunity to do that.  So I don't think it's operationally, meaning that we're putting the 2 business. In fact, I know it's not. We're not putting the businesses together, but I think it's just going to allow us to be a little bit more efficient and at pace to work together as kind of a One GPC team, which is a philosophy that we've been talking about as an organization. And I think an advantage that we have, given the similarities of all the initiatives that we're doing around the world to go at pace and drive impact faster than perhaps if we were not together as a company. I think the comment that we made in the first call was true. In April, we did accelerate from the March performance. And as you articulated, and as I think we said, April and May were close to each other in this quarter and then June was the deceleration, and we called it flattish. So call it low single digit, low single digit, flattish for the quarter. I'm not sure I'd go that far. I would say, first and foremost, this part of the business is always discussing price, obviously, because they're big scale accounts. So I wouldn't say that those types of discussions are more intense today than they were before. I think we're just bringing a fresh perspective to making sure that our value prop is being appreciated. And we're also doing work with smaller regional \"major accounts\" that we can really drive a lot of value with given all the capabilities that we bring to them. So I think it's just a stepped-up level of focus and strategic discipline about taking care of our customers."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with record sales and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our second quarter once again highlights the value and benefit of our global automotive and industrial businesses and the mix and geographic diversity of our company which we believe are competitive advantages that differentiate GPC in the marketplace. A few highlights from our second quarter results include: Total sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 5.6% from the prior year. Total company segment margin of 10.4% and an increase of 60 basis points from the same quarter last year. Earnings per share of $2.44, an increase of 10.9% from adjusted earnings per share last year, and our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation priorities. Our global team remains focused on the strategic initiatives we highlighted at our Investor Day in March. And we believe our One GPC approach is contributing to our strong financial performance. We compete in 2 very large and fragmented markets and see significant opportunities to grow our business, expand our margin profile and generate strong cash flow to support our strategic investments while delivering returns to our shareholders. As we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, we believe our focused execution, investments in our business and strong industry fundamentals, position GPC for long-term success. Looking at our Industrial segment, demand trends held solid through the second quarter, even as the rate of sales growth tempered a bit relative to the first quarter as we expected. Motion's growth rate on a 2-year basis continues to be exceptional. And while certain economic indicators have slowed, we believe our strong market share position, along with the diversity of our products, services and end markets bode well for our continued growth prospects. In addition, future reshoring opportunities and the growth of domestic manufacturing industries provide significant opportunity for Motion. And as you will hear from Will, our team's focus on productivity and efficiency is driving significant margin expansion in the Industrial segment. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the broad geographic diversity of our markets. In addition, we believe our long history of supporting the DIFM customer segment which is 80% of our global automotive sales, positions us well as sales growth to DIFM customers continues to outpace DIY sales growth. During the second quarter, our international Automotive businesses delivered strong mid-single to double-digit growth, while our U.S. automotive business experienced low single-digit growth. The fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket remain favorable with trends such as increasing miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet, rising interest rates, and continued high prices for vehicles, all contributing to underlying demand. While the near-term environment remains dynamic, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. And with the strong earnings growth in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for 2023 earnings per share, which Bert will discuss further. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategic plans, and we'll continue to invest to strengthen our business and achieve both our near- and long-term financial targets while returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. So in closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the outstanding work of our HR and IT teams in Q2 around our implementation of Workday. In early July, we completed the first phase of our implementation of the Workday HR platform in North America. Continuing to demonstrate the modernization of our system platforms and supporting our teams with the right tools and the right technology. Our HR and IT teams delivered an exceptional outcome, well ahead of schedule, showcasing the benefits of our One GPC talent and technology initiatives. So before I turn it over to Will, we want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Thank you, Bert. Before we get into Q&A, we'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Sid Jones, who has announced his decision to retire from Genuine Parts Company after 33 years of service to the company. Sid has been leading our Investor Relations team since 2003 and today marks his 83rd quarterly earnings call at GPC in that role. We thank Sid his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the very best in his retirement. Tim Walsh has been working closely with Sid and the team for over a year and will be named Head of Investor Relations on August 1st. We look forward to having Tim in his new role and now he will do an exceptional job for us.  So with that, we are now ready for your questions. And Chris, I would just tag on to that, that the fundamentals of the industry are still solid -- miles driven, going in the right direction as gas prices moderate a bit. New car sales being still a bit soft compared to historic numbers. And we're seeing the same across our international business as well. So as we reported our team in Europe had a phenomenal quarter, strong double-digit growth. Many of the fundamentals there, the same here across North America, rock solid. And our team in Asia Pac, Australia, New Zealand also had another really strong quarter. So fundamentals of automotive are still rock solid. And we certainly see improvement as we move forward through the back half of the year. Which one is your favorite kids, you know, Bret? Yes. I'll take a shot at that, Bret. And then maybe Will can tag on what perhaps more specific thought. Look, first and foremost, I'd say we're not going to speak to specific strategies of our competitors. We got a lot of respect for our peers and they're doing what they've got to do for their business. What I would tell you, the competitive landscape, the dynamics are still rational. We play in huge markets, as outlined by Will. We've got lots of different competitors across all those markets, both big and small. What we really spend our time thinking about, Bret, and you won't -- this is not new news. It's about inventory availability. Ensuring we've got the right people in the right markets, ensuring we've got our store footprint -- the right store footprint to cover all of our strategic markets and allowing us to continue to grow profitably. We're in a break-fix model and helping our customers really solve their problems quickly with the right part in the right market at the right price. It's all part of our value prop. That hasn't changed, Bret. And honestly, I don't see that changing anytime soon. Do we think about price? Sure, we do. But right now, our customers are really more focused on ensuring they can be productive in their shops. That they're taking care of their customers. And we think we're a pretty good partner not only here in North America, but around the world to solve those challenges for them. So Will, I don't know if there's anything else from a pricing environment that you would want to comment on? Daniel, I would just add to Will's comments, Randy has done a phenomenal job at Motion as you've seen in the numbers, and we expect that to continue because we've got a great leadership team at Motion. And as you know, every business, it's much bigger than one person.  I would say the same by U.S. automotive, Daniel. And I'm glad you asked the question because it gives me the opportunity to recognize that team. Kevin did a great job over the last few years of really bringing in a lot of new talent into the leadership group at U.S. Automotive. That team, I have 100% confidence, it is going to continue to drive improvements in U.S. automotive. And I have no doubt Randy will continue on with the good work that Kevin did by leading that team. So we're excited by the moves and look forward to the impact that Randy is going to have across both businesses. Yes. Thank you. And I just want to reiterate, we are super proud of our team, the way they continue to operate and in a challenging environment around the world. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today, and thanks for your combined and continued interest in Genuine Parts Company.  We'll look forward to hosting another call in the third quarter and report on our results. So we'll have another call on October 19th. In the meantime, stay cool and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you."

We were pleased with the continued strength and momentum in our businesses and to report results that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Before I share my comments on the first quarter, I want to share a few thoughts from our 2023 Investor Day, which we hosted just this past month. We use this event to convey our confidence in the bright future of Genuine Parts Company and update everyone on our strategy and the many opportunities we see for long-term profitable growth. During the course of the day, we highlighted our rich history, ongoing transformation and strategic priorities, which we showcased through several key initiatives in an interactive expo. Our panel discussion with our global business unit leaders, allowed us to share specific business and market opportunities and provide insights to the collaboration among our leaders and synergies across the businesses. Finally, we provided three-year financial targets, including a compelling outlook for double-digit EPS CAGR and a double-digit EBITDA and segment profit margin by 2025. It was a great day for the GPC leadership team and hopefully, an informative and productive day for all of our attendees and everyone in the financial community more broadly. If you missed it, we invite you to view the full presentation on our Investor Relations website. So now let's turn to the first quarter. We are proud of the outstanding work by our global GPC teammates, with sales and earnings coming in ahead of our expectations. Our first quarter performance was a clear example of how our strategic transformation to a global automotive and industrial company is a competitive advantage that distinguishes GPC in the marketplace. We benefited from our business mix and the geographic diversity of our operations with continued strong performances in our international automotive businesses and in the industrial segment. A few highlights in the quarter include; record quarterly sales of $5.8 billion, up 9% from the prior year, segment margin of 9.1%, up 50 basis points from 2022. Earnings per share of $2.14, up 15% from adjusted EPS last year, and our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we strengthened our balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation. The global GPC team is focused on driving accelerated sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow through dynamic economic conditions. Across our businesses, our teammates are aligned and executing on our strategic plan to deliver outstanding customer service and continued market share gains. In industrial, demand trends held strong throughout the first quarter with new and existing customer activity and reshoring trends each presenting growth opportunities. We believe our continued momentum in industrial is due to the diversity of our product and service offerings and end markets, which all performed well again this quarter. Our acquisition of KDG and enhanced capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance are proving to be competitive differentiators, and we remain bullish on this business in the near-term. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the geographic diversity of our markets, which helped to offset the headwinds of a warmer winter and volatile weather conditions in our US automotive business in Q1. In addition, the automotive aftermarket is benefiting from trends such as the ongoing increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and rising interest rates and continued high prices for new and used vehicles. These are all key drivers to ongoing growth in demand, especially for the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our global automotive sales. So after delivering back-to-back record years, we are pleased with the solid start to 2023 and we continue to expect another strong year of profitable growth. Looking ahead, we are confident that GPC is well-positioned with the right strategic plans, strong fundamentals, and rock-solid balance sheet to pursue accretive organic and acquisitive investment opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers around the world. So now I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team for the strong start to the year. We appreciate all your hard work to take care of our customers every day. As Paul referenced earlier, the pride in our business was on display at our Investor Day last month. We were excited to share our vision, unique advantages, market opportunities and how we're winning as we execute strategic initiatives. Our initiatives are focused on talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. As we shared during the sessions, our team is well positioned with leadership positions in attractive, fragmented markets with established customer relationships, global supplier partnerships, technical expertise and a scaled global infrastructure. We work together with shared values as one GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value. Turning our attention to the first quarter performance in our two business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial segment were $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $240 million or 11.9%. Comparable sales growth increased approximately 12.1% in the first quarter versus last year. This marks Motion's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, January and February were the strongest two months on a one-year basis, but on a two-year basis, sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. In March 2023, Motion eclipsed the previous monthly sales and profit record set in March of 2022. The sales growth at Motion continues to be broad-based with double-digit growth across most product categories and major industries serve. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to see solid performance with its corporate account initiatives, as sales with these customers grew approximately 20% in the first quarter. The corporate account strength is driven from not only new customers but also strategic renewals of existing relationships. In Asia Pac, our Motion business continues to build on its momentum posting sales and profit growth well over 20% for the quarter. We realigned the leadership of the industrial business in Asia Pac by organizing under one automotive and industrial leadership team in the fall of 2022. The team has made impressive progress to identify opportunities, take action and deliver performance. Industrial segment profit in the first quarter was approximately $262 million or 11.6% of sales, representing a 230 basis point increase from the same period last year. The continued profit improvement for this segment reflects excellent operating discipline on strong sales growth, both in North America and Asia Pac. In addition, the team in North America continues to build on the synergies from the KDG acquisition last year. As we reported at our Investor Day, thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in the first year, and we expect to achieve our target over $50 million in total synergies by the end of this year, one year earlier than our initial expectation. For the quarter, Global Industrial represented 50% of total GPC segment profit. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Total sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately $230 million or 7% versus the same period in 2022. Total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the US posted high single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency during the first quarter. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, Global Automotive sales were strongest in February and March. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased approximately 7%, with comps ranging from low single digits in the United States to low double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pac. As Paul mentioned, we remain encouraged by the solid industry fundamentals and team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth. Global automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $264 million, essentially flat with last year and segment operating margin was 7.5% compared to 8.1% in 2022. The strong performance of our European, Canadian and Asia Pac businesses helped to partially offset lower margins in our US Automotive business. Profit in the US Automotive business was impacted by a sluggish start to the year on sales, combined with planned investments in wages and elevated freight out expense. Now, let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the US, automotive sales grew approximately 4% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. The first quarter represents the toughest year-over-year comparison of 2023, with an approximate 12% comp growth in the first quarter of 2022. Looking at our average daily sales, growth was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. However, milder winter temperatures combined with extreme weather events impacted automotive demand in certain product categories and periodically disrupted operations. As examples, sales of batteries were positive, but below internal plans during the quarter, particularly in the Northeast. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling and undercar, with strength in various core categories such as filters, brakes and fluids, all of which had growth above the US average. Growth was consistent across our regions, except for our west region, which experienced a more pronounced negative impact from weather, which temporarily disrupted many of our operations. Overall, we estimate that weather negatively impacted US Automotive sales by approximately 1% in the quarter. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive, with mid-single-digit commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increase across all customer segments, including continued strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare network. The sales performance at US Automotive started the year slow relative to our expectations. As a result, the team acted during March to address cost while balancing its longer-term investment priorities. The benefits of the actions will be weighted towards the second half of the year. Sales have improved during the first half of April when compared to March and the team remains focused on delivering in 2023 despite the soft start to the year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 9% in local currency during the first quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like brakes, chassis and filtration, all of which were up double digits in the first quarter. In addition, we saw strong performance in our heavy-duty business, which outperformed the total Canadian growth rate. These categories helped offset headwinds in certain weather-related categories like batteries, which were pressured by a milder winter season. We're pleased with the strong quarter in Canada, and we continue to see compelling opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals, share gain initiatives, and strong team execution. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. The strong growth in market share gains across Europe continue to be driven by solid execution of key initiatives. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies as our teams continue to win new business with key accounts drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. We're on track to grow our NAPA branded sales from \u20ac300 million in 2022 to approximately \u20ac400 million in 2023. Our entry into Spain and Portugal in 2022 has exceeded our expectations and value creation plans as it benefits from the NAPA brand and European scale advantage. In addition, our team is expanding our NexDrive EV service shops to approximately 400 locations, up from 150 shops in 2022. We believe our NexDrive offering will position the European team to lead our industry in the growing EV aftermarket. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased approximately 14% in local currency from the same period in the prior year, with comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with both growing at a double-digit rate in the first quarter. In addition, March saw record sales and profit results across several go-to-market channels, including Repco, NAPA, and our motorcycle accessories. Asia-Pac continued to make impressive progress on its talent and culture and customer-centric growth initiatives. We continue to complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the first quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions, primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership and create long-term value. In summary, the global GPC team delivered strong first quarter results and we remain confident in the outlook for the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We will execute our near and long-term initiatives and focus on what we can control. Our investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain, and emerging tech will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams as they continue to navigate a dynamic environment and I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights of our first quarter performance. Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no non-recurring items in the first quarter of 2023. However, our comparisons to the prior year do exclude certain non-recurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG. Total GPC sales increased 8.9% or $470 million to $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This reflects an 8.7% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and a 2.4% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 2.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Overall, our balanced portfolio and global diversification drove record total sales and strong earnings to start the year. Our gross margin was 34.9% in the first quarter, improving 30 basis points from our adjusted gross margin last year, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives. The favorable impact of these and other initiatives contributed approximately 60 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by two key headwinds. First, a shift in sales mix related to the strength of our industrial business, which impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points; and second, foreign currency, which also impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. As we highlighted at Investor Day, our ongoing execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin continue to drive strong results. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and in line with the prior year at 27.9% of sales. The increase in expenses in Q1 reflects the combination of solid discipline in managing core costs, offset by planned investments in our teams due to inflationary wage conditions and increased spending in technology to support our ongoing strategic initiatives. As Will noted, with elevated operating costs pressuring margins in the first quarter in our US Automotive business, we have taken actions in March to address these headwinds, which we anticipate to persist into Q2. We expect these cost actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business and the execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our performance in the first quarter generated total segment profit of $526 million, up 16% and a segment profit margin of 9.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of segment margin expansion. Our first quarter net income was $304 million or $2.14 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $266 million or $1.86 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 15%. Our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth is indicative of the hard work and crisp execution by our teams to implement our strategic initiatives across our global operations. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $198 million in cash from operations in the first quarter. This compares to $399 million in cash from operations last year, which included the sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. Free cash flow was $109 million, and we closed the first quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of two to 2.5 times. We are well-positioned with financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities that may become available across the business. We remain committed to our long history of disciplined capital allocation. Our four key priorities for capital allocation are unchanged and include investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we invested $88 million in capital expenditures, primarily around supply chain and technology. These investments support many of the initiatives we shared at Investor Day that we believe will drive the modernization of our business moving forward. We also invested $40 million for acquisitions, which remains a key element of our growth strategy. As Will mentioned earlier, we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses. For the quarter, we returned $194 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $126 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $68 million of cash used to repurchase 411,000 shares. We are well-positioned with the cash flow to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 23rd and reaffirmed on March 23rd at our Investor Day. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.95 to $9.10, an increase of approximately 7% to 9% from 2022. This represents a $0.15 increase from our previous guidance of $8.80 to $8.95. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% comparable sale increase, and with the ongoing assumption of stronger first half year-on-year sales growth relative to the second half of 2023, although our view on Q2 and Q3 have improved modestly. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are raising our outlook for cash from operations to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion previously. We are raising our outlook for free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of $800 billion [ph] to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others. In closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year and positive momentum in our business. While our US Automotive business had a slow start to the year, we've started Q2 with good sales momentum and expect our team to execute, build traction through the second quarter and have a solid second half of 2023. Our outlook for the full year reflects the ongoing confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute through the dynamic economic environment. GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. As we shared at Investor Day, our team is well positioned to execute our plans to deliver our targets for a double-digit EPS CAGR over the next three years and double-digit margins by 2025. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Just one housekeeping question. Just it sounds like weather was a little noisy during the quarter, but the fundamentals are still intact. Can you remind us what exposure you have to California or to the West?\nWill Stengel: Yes. Kate, it's a good question. I would say we don't have an outsized exposure to any one region. The breakdown of the US automotive revenue is probably directionally correct, equally split across the regions.\nKate McShane: Okay. Thank you. And then I think you mentioned in the prepared comments that because of the sluggish start in January, your team pivoted to some new strategies that will impact the second half. Can you talk a little bit more about what that is? And what impact do you think it will have in the second half?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Kate, this is Bert. I'll talk a little bit about -- maybe I'll start with the outlook as a starting point, just to give you some context for the full year. I'll talk a little bit about Q2, and then I'll flip it to Will and will give you a little bit more color on the cost actions in US auto specifically. When we think about the full year, we did raise the outlook $0.15. That's a 1.5% increase on the top end of our range, really on the back of a better-than-expected first quarter and our expectations, as we've commented for US Auto to recover against some of these Q1 headwinds and a stronger view on Motion performance over the coming two quarters. When we think about that, I do want to remind everyone that we do expect growth to moderate in 2023. We had exceptional growth in 2021 and 2022. But we're still looking at very solid earnings growth at 7% to 9% year-over-year with the new range. The business continues to perform well. We're going to continue to capitalize on size and scale, and bullish against our execution of our own strategic initiatives. And I think we're off to a great start as we march towards our 2025 targets that we shared on Investor Day. We're obviously being very balanced and being prudent against the external factors that are out there. Inflation levels, foreign currency and the geopolitical landscape, just to name a few. When I think about Q2, just to give you some color there about how we're thinking about the upcoming quarter, we started off in a good place. Global Automotive is in line with April, 7% on the top line. And within that, as Will stated in his prepared remarks, US auto has started off with good momentum in the month of April, accelerating from March. We see continued strength in international auto and the global industrial business momentum is carried into Q2. But, again, we do expect that to normalize against the Q1 rate. Those cost pressures in US Auto, I think, will persist into the early part of Q2 for the balance of the quarter probably, and Will will talk about those just in a moment on what we're doing to get us back to the expected level of performance that we're looking for in the second half. One thing I'd remind you, too, on Q2 is, just as you think about your models, recall that Q2 of 2022 represented our strongest earnings growth last year. And as a result, when we think about our guidance for the full year, the second quarter of 2023 will be -- our expectation will be that it will be our lowest earnings growth rate for this year. So Will, maybe you want to just take that from there and fill in a little bit more specific on the cost actions at US Auto.\nWill Stengel: Yes. Happy to, Bert. Kate, I would say, obviously, the teams around the world have been incredibly focused on costs. So, I wouldn't say, there's any necessarily new actions or levers being pulled. I think we're just stepping up the urgency and the focus at US Automotive. They're predominantly around as you would suspect, all things people, in particular around more rigor on over time in stores and DCs, just being super thoughtful to make sure that we're balancing cost with taking care of our customers, T&E expense. We've also pulled together some accelerated plans around merchandising and freight cost strategies, which will take a little bit of time to materialize here through the second half of the year. But we're going to balance near-term cost actions with, as we've talked about, long-term investments, and make sure that we're doing the right thing for the business over the medium and long term.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nPaul Donahue: Good morning, Bret.\nWill Stengel: Hi, Bret.\nBret Jordan: On the US Auto, I think you said the comp was plus 3%. Could you break out price versus units in that number?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Brett. So total GPC price, mid-single digits. Global automotive, slightly higher than that. I would put US Automotive in that category. Industrial, slightly under the mid-single digit, low single digit. So probably mid-single digit plus is probably a good estimate for US Auto.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then, you talked about margin benefits from pricing initiatives. And could you talk about what you're seeing out there? And, I guess, auto and industrial as well, as sort of market share dynamics and how the competitive pricing environment looks this year? Obviously, you guys were investing in price a year or so ago, but Auto Plus has gone Chapter 11, so maybe there's some sort of change in dynamics out there as far as the competition.\nWill Stengel: Yes. It's a good question, Bert. I would say, generally speaking, in US Automotive, the -- we haven't seen any material change in the pricing dynamics as we've talked about many quarters before. It is a dynamic environment. That's why we're so focused on our strategic pricing initiatives and all the investments we're making there. Like every industry, people are picking and choosing and executing strategies in the market, just like we are. But it is kind of a rational but dynamic market. So, we're really not seeing anything materially different than what we've seen in the last few quarters. We're going to focus on what we think is right from a strategic pricing perspective. As you heard at Investor Day, we've put a lot of investment into tools and talent and new rigor around collecting intelligence to make sure that we're in the right place for our customers. You also heard a lot about the NAPA brand and the role that, that plays in particular, in Europe in our assortment strategy and all the great work that our merchants and sourcing teams are doing around the world. So, we're being very thoughtful in this pricing environment, but I wouldn't say there's a material change despite some of the developments that you noted in your question.\nBert Nappier: And Bret, this is Bert Nappier. I'll just add a little bit to that. And you see that effectiveness with our margin -- gross margin expansion here in Q1 up 30 basis points. And within that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 60 basis points of improvement from these activities that Will just outlined. So, the core is really performing well. We had some headwinds from mix and FX, but we're really pleased with how all of that work is flowing through and delivering in terms of gross margin improvement.\nBret Jordan: And just sort of a follow-up on that point. Now, that you've got Asia-Pac sort of industrial and auto under 1 team. the potential to leverage the sourcing, buying products from the same suppliers for both segments. Is that something that you're seeing better traction in down there versus the broader portfolio?\nWill Stengel: I wouldn't isolate it to down in Asia-Pac. In fact, we just had our global sourcing teammates here in Atlanta from all around the world to continue to build on this exciting momentum where all geographies on both sides of the business will be better aligned and more press on where we have our opportunities. So, I wouldn't say that Asia-Pac is benefiting now more on sourcing. Having said that, they are benefiting from being together as a team, and that's a big part of how they're thinking about their business as they move forward. And so whether you're talking about the organization design, back-office cost, et cetera. I think there's a lot of opportunities for them to continue to work better as one organization.\nBret Jordan: Would you do broader integration globally? If it works in Asia-Pac, would you just think about merging more of the overhead on both sides of the business?\nWill Stengel: I think we have an opportunity to work together to leverage our scale, the definition of what you mean by merged business units, probably not. But working together as a team, you heard at Investor Day, the importance of One GPC. That's the perfect philosophy around how do we work together to make sure that we're capturing all the opportunities as a global organization.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJosh Young: Hey, good morning. This is Josh on for Scott. So, on the segment margins, with automotive down 60 basis points in the quarter, industrial up over 200. Can you just unpack a little more what the drivers were there for each segment?\nBert Nappier: Hey Josh, it's Bert. I'll take that one, and I'll start kind of at the GPC level. When we think about -- we had margin expansion for gross margin, really, where we're focused on some of that drag is in SG&A. SG&A was up 10 basis points year-over-year. That's really a mix of three factors: inflation, planned investments in the business and then offset by really strong leverage across the business outside of US Auto. For the quarter, when we think about how to really think about the elements, I would say we had SG&A pressure about 50 basis points from those planned investments that we shared at the beginning of the year and again at Investor Day, in IT and talent. Now, some of the talent cost is certainly going to be inflation driven, but we're making very thoughtful investment in talent and IT, which we see as critical for the future. When you look at US Auto, the quarter was impacted by higher personnel costs there and freight delivery costs. So that's the outbound freight from a DC to a store. The wage side was really again the impact of planned investments we made to ensure we're staying competitive. I think everybody is facing that across all businesses and talent is a key part of our long-term success. On the freight side, we're seeing the impact of higher rates from our carriers as they're looking to do the same thing, they're looking to cover higher wages due to driver shortages. So those two things on the automotive side were part of the equation. The other thing I would just say is that, I turn back to this weather consideration. We really didn't anticipate that, as you would expect. None of us are forecasters here in terms of weather. But -- we didn't anticipate some of those weather impacts, particularly coming off the very strong December we had in US Auto. So our staffing models were set to align to a sales run rate where we exited 2022. And that was probably a little bit higher than we needed to support Q1 softer sales level. So all of that together compressed margin in US Auto and was a bit of a headwind for us. As we look ahead, the cost of business is doing a little of doing business is a little higher and inflationary conditions are certainly contributing to that. We're reducing where we can. And again, investments we're making in the business that we shared at Investor Day are a big part of driving efficiency. So while two is kind of take that back to the top level again, and maybe talk about these wage investments in IT and why we think they're so important to us. On the IT side, we're making investments to improve our capabilities and modernize our platforms and Nadeem share that extensively last month. We think those are the right things to do. But in certain cases, the pivot in that space is to cloud-based technology. And as many of you know, that changes the dynamic from a capital to operating costs. And as I shared earlier this year, that's about a 30 basis point drag for us for the year. On the talent side, it's a very competitive market out there for talent. And we're making smart investments with our people with a mid-single-digit wage increase. I think that's in line with most businesses, slightly higher for us than 2022. And we also made the decision to take some of the health care costs we were seeing and absorb them here at the corporate level rather than what we might normally do and pass those on to our employees through higher contributions from them. And that's the right thing for our team right now. So I take that all together, we got a little bit of deleverage for the year 30 to 40 basis points. Those two things are 60. So you can see we're really leveraging outside of that US auto business right now. And with that, we expect margin for the full year to be up 20 to 40 basis points. And as you saw in Q1, we were up 50 basis points.\nJosh Young: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then could you just walk us through what you saw in terms of inflation during the quarter and what your expectations are for the balance of the year here?\nBert Nappier: Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one as well. As we look at Q1, inflation moderated slightly during the quarter. That was in line with our expectations. Again, we think monetary policies here in the US and around the world are having the desired effect. But that does take a little time to flow through. Q1 inflation and sales, all GPC total was mid-single digit. Auto was high single digit. And again, industrial, which has been very consistent, low single digits. Our expectation for inflation for the rest of the year is for it to continue to moderate. That's pretty consistent with the view I just shared at Investor Day. Obviously, the actual impact is yet to be seen. But our assumption is that the automotive business will tick down from high single digits to low single digits to close out the year. Industrial will stay in that low single-digit range and that GPC that translates in us going from mid-single digit to low single digits.\nJosh Young: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher, your line is open. Perhaps your line is mute on your end.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning everybody. So a couple of follow-up questions. First, is it fair to say that you were expecting US NAPA to be more like a 4% comp for the first quarter, considering you pointed out a point of on the weather side? And is that a fair interpretation of where the business is running in April?\nWill Stengel: The first part of your question is fair. And the second part of your question is fair.\nChristopher Horvers: Okay. And so dovetailing back to the US NAPA division, you talked about 20 to 40 basis points of segment margin expansion. So was it -- is the original plan that you would deleverage the NAPA operating margin due to the investments?\nBert Nappier: Chris, this is Bert. So when I talked about 20 to 40 basis points of segment margin improvement, I'm talking about GPC consolidated. I don't really want to get into parsing the onion too finely between the elements of that. But we were not expecting margin declines in either segment for the year. The math would be difficult to achieve 20 to 40 basis points being up consolidated for either of the two segments to be down year-over-year. Look, we had a softer start to the year in US Auto. We've got a great plan here in place with some cost actions we're taking, but it will take a little time to build traction and auger in through the quarter. We're looking for a really solid second half there and building that momentum for us, and we feel good about that.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then just on the freight front understanding that there's some wage cost being pass-through and driver shortages, fuel prices surged in March of last year and all your freight out, I'm assuming it's a periodic expense. So should the freight start to be a tailwind here in the second quarter? And then how long before maybe some of the capitalized freight costs turned to a tailwind later in the year? Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. It's Bert again. Look, on the cost of ocean freight, those that are included in our inbound and cost of goods sold. My gross margin projection for the year and our guidance assumes we get a bit of a tailwind of that in the second half. That's clearly our expectation. I think that's in line with the market. On the outbound freight, diesel fuel is still up year-over-year just slightly in the quarter. It started out January, I think, in the north of 20%, moderated a bit in February into the teens and then turned positive in March. The net sum of that was about a 3.5% increase for the quarter in fuel cost. And so we had a bit of a headwind there on top of the rates we're getting from the carriers in terms of fuel as it relates to diesel, and that is primary -- that's the primary component of that delivery cost as we think about fuel when it goes from the DC to the store. We would expect that, if March is an indicator that, that will start to tick down a bit and could be a benefit to us. Will mentioned that we've got some actions related to that. On the labor side, I think it's pretty sticky, though. When we think about these carriers, and we're all facing higher wages. Year-over-year, the cost of doing business is undeniably higher because of wage rates, and I don't think those will abate. But we might get a little bit of a tailwind here on the fuel aspect and see how that maps out over the next couple of quarters. Sorry for the long answer.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much. No, thank you so much.\nWill Stengel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nLiz Suzuki: Hi, thank you. Just -- I guess this is more of a theoretical question about acquisition opportunities. I mean historically, you've acquired businesses that are performing well that can bring synergies to your core operations in both Industrial and Automotive. But if there were underperforming competitors in either a category where you saw an opportunity to bring GPC's distribution capabilities to that business. Would that ever we consider it as an acquisition target?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Liz, it's a great question, and the answer is yes. We're going to do deals that create value that align with our strategy, regardless of how they're performing. And I would say our capabilities in this part of the business positions us pretty well as the environment gets tougher. We're going to be really disciplined on whether they're a good business or a challenged business. But if we can create value and it makes sense for our strategy, I think the power of our balance sheet and our liquidity position is that's exactly the type of environment that we want to operate in, so we can leverage our scale.\nLiz Suzuki: Got you. And then just on the guidance for the year, the interest expense came down a little bit. So it sounds like there are no near-term plans to take on additional leverage, but just wanted to get your thoughts about that and on your current debt level and any near-term plans for cash outside of the opportunities that you laid out already in your -- in the slides.\nBert Nappier: Hi, Liz, it's Bert. Look, there's nothing in the near-term that has really changed or really for the balance of the year in terms of how we're thinking. Interest expense has come down a bit. We've had a little less need to borrow against our revolver intra-month, which has been a bit of a benefit to us and intentional. And then when we think about the uses of cash and our capital allocation for the year, it's still pretty balanced. We don't have anything different than what we shared at Investor Day and no different plans. The only thing that's on the horizon is we've got a debt maturity at the end of the year. And obviously, we'll want to be thinking about the environment that the capital market brings to us as we get closer to that and how we think about refinancing or paying back or some of the various options we might have. So again, just being really disciplined as we always are being faithful to our four priorities on capital allocation and no surprises for you guys.\nLiz Suzuki: Perfect. Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Yes.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Liz.\nOperator: And the next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: I have a follow-up on Auto and then turn to Industrial. I just want to make sure on the Auto margin, it looks like the decline was pretty much all in the US business. Is it fair to say that both Europe and Asia Pacific segment Auto margins were up year-on-year?\nBert Nappier: That's fair to say.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then the -- on the Industrial side, how sustainable is the expansion rate, but also just the level that you've gotten to in industrial? Is something changed there about the fundamental profitability of that side of the business?\nBert Nappier: Greg, this is Bert. I wouldn't say there's anything fundamental that's changed other than just continued strong momentum and building on the actions in that business over the last couple of years. You build on industrial team that -- and the Motion team that is executing at a very high level, their core business, a stellar integration of KDG and how we've achieved synergy, which was transformational in driving additional size and scale and creating opportunity. That combination has allowed us to continue to improve margin in that business. As we shared at Investor Day, we're looking at that business being at a 12% level. And so, we're marching towards that as a target. And, obviously, this quarter gave you a glimpse of our progression in that regard. And I think we're on the right track to hit that level of profitability as we shared at Investor Day based on what we see right now and what we see for the next several quarters.\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Greg, this is Paul. I would just cap off both those comments. When you think about the two businesses, Auto and Industrial, and we've talked about this a good bit in the past. We talked about it during Investor Day. If you go back a few years, we laid out our multi-year diversification strategy. And I would tell you, this is a classic quarter where that strategy is really paying dividends. And it's -- and hats off to our teams, our Industrial team, our international teams all really delivered in Q1. We could not be more proud of them.\nGreg Melich: Very well. Congrats guys and good luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Greg.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Greg.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please, go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. My first question is just on the weather effects going forward. Given the gyrations you saw through the winter, do you expect the weather to be a drag on sales through the balance of the year?\nWill Stengel: Hey, Seth, it's Will. Listen, I don't -- I'm not in the -- I don't think any of us are in the business of forecasting the weather as we move forward. So, no, we haven't modeled in any of our forward commentary or outlook impact from weather.\nPaul Donahue: Seth, I've been at this a number of years. It was a crazy, crazy quarter. When I look back at our call in January, we were sitting here in Atlanta, and it was 80 degrees, yet many parts of the country were shut down with incredible snowfall. At this point in time, all we're going to do is we're going to focus on what we can control. And our businesses are all performing at a really high level. We expect that to continue regardless of what Mother Nature has in store for us in the balance of the year.\nSeth Basham: Understood. And in terms of the 100 basis points drag from weather in the quarter, was it more pronounced on the DIY side than the do-it-for-me side?\nWill Stengel: Yes, I don't think we can make a distinction between DIY and DIFM from a weather perspective. I mean, 80% of our business is do-it-for-me. So -- but there's no distinction between the two.\nSeth Basham: Fair enough. Thank you.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Seth.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Seth.\nOperator: And our final question for today will come from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Inc. Please, go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to start as a follow-up on the industrial margin kind of outlook you guys provided. Bert talked about kind of 12% guidepost. If I look at 1Q, really strong expansion, but the growth was up double digits. Obviously, the guide is calling for growth to slow to get to that 5% midpoint for the year. It's your expectation, just to make sure we understood that correctly, margins would still be up year-over-year for the coming quarters, just maybe up less than the first quarter, or how would you think about the pace of industrial expansion as that headline growth flows through the year?\nBert Nappier: Well, I don't want to get into giving quarterly guidance on the Industrial segment, but I'll just talk about the full year and tell you that when you think about the industrial business, we've got, as we -- I think we've said repeatedly high single-digit topline growth model for the first half. That moderates down to low single digits in the second half based on our expectation of economic conditions, which could obviously change. Even with all of that, even with a low single-digit outlook for the second half, we're expecting the segment to improve its margin for the full year. Will it be at the same rate as Q1? No. We're not modeling that, and you know that from our full year guidance. But in a lower growth moderated environment in the second half that business will still perform well on a margin basis, and we expect that margin to expand for the full year, which is why we're looking at overall GPC margin expansion for the full year as well.\nDaniel Imbro: Great. I appreciate that color. And then to follow-up on the automotive margin, not to beat a dead horse, but you mentioned the wage investment and kind of I think you mentioned it in the question, the cost of doing business has gone up. I guess, what inning are we in, in terms of those wage investments as and when do we begin to lap these and we could return to levering that wage line on a low to mid-single-digit type comp? Just what's that kind of outlook look like on those investments you're planning on making in the business?\nBert Nappier: Well, look, I'll just tell you that we spent the last 12 months or so moving down the P&L in terms of inflation impact, starting with the topline and cost of goods sold, I think all businesses, so I don't want to put us in some unique camp. I think all businesses are starting to feel the impact of inflation in the heart of the P&L. And that's now moving into freight lines, SG&A, personnel costs, and some of those things. To call the inning on that is really tough. My dad was a baseball coach, and I like to say that I'm baseball-ready, but the call to inning on that one is a little difficult. I just go back to the point that in this highly inflationary environment, there's no question the floor has been raised on the cost of doing business. It's not just here in the US, it's around the world. And the best indicator for that is what all companies are facing right now with inflation on wages. I don't want to give you a precise estimate on a range of leverage. I think historically, the company has been talking about a 3% to 4%. If it's been 3% to 4%, it's probably floating closer to the higher end of that range. But the thing we're focused on, and I think it underscores and emphasize the importance of doubling down on these investments and initiatives we're making in productivity and efficiency, modernizing our operations, and the things you heard about at Investor Day will help us. And then we're always going to be faithful to driving leverage and reducing costs where we can. And you saw a great example of that in the business this quarter with the leverage we gained in the Motion business and the International Automotive businesses. So, I think that's a great data point on how we're thinking about modeling this going forward. And obviously, my guidance contemplates that as to our 2025 targets.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes, makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much for all the color.\nBert Nappier: Thanks Daniel.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nPaul Donahue: Yes. Thanks, Chad. We appreciate it. And listen, we appreciate all the questions and all of you joining us this morning. As I hope you've heard, we're incredibly pleased with the strong start to the year and we could not be more proud of the great work being done by all of our GPC teammates around the world. We're -- we continue to be excited with the momentum this business is generating. So, I hope you feel that and heard that today in our in our comments. So, listen, all of you have a great day wherever you are and thanks for your interest in GPC.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team for the strong start to the year. We appreciate all your hard work to take care of our customers every day. As Paul referenced earlier, the pride in our business was on display at our Investor Day last month. We were excited to share our vision, unique advantages, market opportunities and how we're winning as we execute strategic initiatives. Our initiatives are focused on talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&A strategy. As we shared during the sessions, our team is well positioned with leadership positions in attractive, fragmented markets with established customer relationships, global supplier partnerships, technical expertise and a scaled global infrastructure. We work together with shared values as one GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value. Turning our attention to the first quarter performance in our two business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial segment were $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $240 million or 11.9%. Comparable sales growth increased approximately 12.1% in the first quarter versus last year. This marks Motion's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, January and February were the strongest two months on a one-year basis, but on a two-year basis, sales were relatively consistent throughout the quarter. In March 2023, Motion eclipsed the previous monthly sales and profit record set in March of 2022. The sales growth at Motion continues to be broad-based with double-digit growth across most product categories and major industries serve. During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to see solid performance with its corporate account initiatives, as sales with these customers grew approximately 20% in the first quarter. The corporate account strength is driven from not only new customers but also strategic renewals of existing relationships. In Asia Pac, our Motion business continues to build on its momentum posting sales and profit growth well over 20% for the quarter. We realigned the leadership of the industrial business in Asia Pac by organizing under one automotive and industrial leadership team in the fall of 2022. The team has made impressive progress to identify opportunities, take action and deliver performance. Industrial segment profit in the first quarter was approximately $262 million or 11.6% of sales, representing a 230 basis point increase from the same period last year. The continued profit improvement for this segment reflects excellent operating discipline on strong sales growth, both in North America and Asia Pac. In addition, the team in North America continues to build on the synergies from the KDG acquisition last year. As we reported at our Investor Day, thanks to the incredible teamwork for many, Motion realized over $30 million in synergies in the first year, and we expect to achieve our target over $50 million in total synergies by the end of this year, one year earlier than our initial expectation. For the quarter, Global Industrial represented 50% of total GPC segment profit. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Total sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately $230 million or 7% versus the same period in 2022. Total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the US posted high single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency during the first quarter. From a cadence perspective, through the quarter, Global Automotive sales were strongest in February and March. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased approximately 7%, with comps ranging from low single digits in the United States to low double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pac. As Paul mentioned, we remain encouraged by the solid industry fundamentals and team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth. Global automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $264 million, essentially flat with last year and segment operating margin was 7.5% compared to 8.1% in 2022. The strong performance of our European, Canadian and Asia Pac businesses helped to partially offset lower margins in our US Automotive business. Profit in the US Automotive business was impacted by a sluggish start to the year on sales, combined with planned investments in wages and elevated freight out expense. Now, let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the US, automotive sales grew approximately 4% during the quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 3%. The first quarter represents the toughest year-over-year comparison of 2023, with an approximate 12% comp growth in the first quarter of 2022. Looking at our average daily sales, growth was relatively consistent throughout the quarter. However, milder winter temperatures combined with extreme weather events impacted automotive demand in certain product categories and periodically disrupted operations. As examples, sales of batteries were positive, but below internal plans during the quarter, particularly in the Northeast. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling and undercar, with strength in various core categories such as filters, brakes and fluids, all of which had growth above the US average. Growth was consistent across our regions, except for our west region, which experienced a more pronounced negative impact from weather, which temporarily disrupted many of our operations. Overall, we estimate that weather negatively impacted US Automotive sales by approximately 1% in the quarter. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive, with mid-single-digit commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increase across all customer segments, including continued strength with our fleet and government channel and mid-single-digit growth in our NAPA AutoCare network. The sales performance at US Automotive started the year slow relative to our expectations. As a result, the team acted during March to address cost while balancing its longer-term investment priorities. The benefits of the actions will be weighted towards the second half of the year. Sales have improved during the first half of April when compared to March and the team remains focused on delivering in 2023 despite the soft start to the year. In Canada, sales grew approximately 9% in local currency during the first quarter, with comparable sales growth of approximately 9%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like brakes, chassis and filtration, all of which were up double digits in the first quarter. In addition, we saw strong performance in our heavy-duty business, which outperformed the total Canadian growth rate. These categories helped offset headwinds in certain weather-related categories like batteries, which were pressured by a milder winter season. We're pleased with the strong quarter in Canada, and we continue to see compelling opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals, share gain initiatives, and strong team execution. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 22% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 13%. The strong growth in market share gains across Europe continue to be driven by solid execution of key initiatives. During the first quarter, we saw high single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies as our teams continue to win new business with key accounts drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region. We're on track to grow our NAPA branded sales from \u20ac300 million in 2022 to approximately \u20ac400 million in 2023. Our entry into Spain and Portugal in 2022 has exceeded our expectations and value creation plans as it benefits from the NAPA brand and European scale advantage. In addition, our team is expanding our NexDrive EV service shops to approximately 400 locations, up from 150 shops in 2022. We believe our NexDrive offering will position the European team to lead our industry in the growing EV aftermarket. In the Asia-Pac automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased approximately 14% in local currency from the same period in the prior year, with comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. Both commercial and retail sales continued to perform well with both growing at a double-digit rate in the first quarter. In addition, March saw record sales and profit results across several go-to-market channels, including Repco, NAPA, and our motorcycle accessories. Asia-Pac continued to make impressive progress on its talent and culture and customer-centric growth initiatives. We continue to complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. During the first quarter, we completed several bolt-on acquisitions, primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active and will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership and create long-term value. In summary, the global GPC team delivered strong first quarter results and we remain confident in the outlook for the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. We will execute our near and long-term initiatives and focus on what we can control. Our investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain, and emerging tech will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Yes. Kate, it's a good question. I would say we don't have an outsized exposure to any one region. The breakdown of the US automotive revenue is probably directionally correct, equally split across the regions. Yes. Happy to, Bert. Kate, I would say, obviously, the teams around the world have been incredibly focused on costs. So, I wouldn't say, there's any necessarily new actions or levers being pulled. I think we're just stepping up the urgency and the focus at US Automotive. They're predominantly around as you would suspect, all things people, in particular around more rigor on over time in stores and DCs, just being super thoughtful to make sure that we're balancing cost with taking care of our customers, T&E expense. We've also pulled together some accelerated plans around merchandising and freight cost strategies, which will take a little bit of time to materialize here through the second half of the year. But we're going to balance near-term cost actions with, as we've talked about, long-term investments, and make sure that we're doing the right thing for the business over the medium and long term. Hi, Bret. Yes, Brett. So total GPC price, mid-single digits. Global automotive, slightly higher than that. I would put US Automotive in that category. Industrial, slightly under the mid-single digit, low single digit. So probably mid-single digit plus is probably a good estimate for US Auto. Yes. It's a good question, Bert. I would say, generally speaking, in US Automotive, the -- we haven't seen any material change in the pricing dynamics as we've talked about many quarters before. It is a dynamic environment. That's why we're so focused on our strategic pricing initiatives and all the investments we're making there. Like every industry, people are picking and choosing and executing strategies in the market, just like we are. But it is kind of a rational but dynamic market. So, we're really not seeing anything materially different than what we've seen in the last few quarters. We're going to focus on what we think is right from a strategic pricing perspective. As you heard at Investor Day, we've put a lot of investment into tools and talent and new rigor around collecting intelligence to make sure that we're in the right place for our customers. You also heard a lot about the NAPA brand and the role that, that plays in particular, in Europe in our assortment strategy and all the great work that our merchants and sourcing teams are doing around the world. So, we're being very thoughtful in this pricing environment, but I wouldn't say there's a material change despite some of the developments that you noted in your question. I wouldn't isolate it to down in Asia-Pac. In fact, we just had our global sourcing teammates here in Atlanta from all around the world to continue to build on this exciting momentum where all geographies on both sides of the business will be better aligned and more press on where we have our opportunities. So, I wouldn't say that Asia-Pac is benefiting now more on sourcing. Having said that, they are benefiting from being together as a team, and that's a big part of how they're thinking about their business as they move forward. And so whether you're talking about the organization design, back-office cost, et cetera. I think there's a lot of opportunities for them to continue to work better as one organization. I think we have an opportunity to work together to leverage our scale, the definition of what you mean by merged business units, probably not. But working together as a team, you heard at Investor Day, the importance of One GPC. That's the perfect philosophy around how do we work together to make sure that we're capturing all the opportunities as a global organization. Thanks. The first part of your question is fair. And the second part of your question is fair. Okay. Thank you. Yes, Liz, it's a great question, and the answer is yes. We're going to do deals that create value that align with our strategy, regardless of how they're performing. And I would say our capabilities in this part of the business positions us pretty well as the environment gets tougher. We're going to be really disciplined on whether they're a good business or a challenged business. But if we can create value and it makes sense for our strategy, I think the power of our balance sheet and our liquidity position is that's exactly the type of environment that we want to operate in, so we can leverage our scale. Thanks, Liz. Thanks, Greg. Hey, Seth, it's Will. Listen, I don't -- I'm not in the -- I don't think any of us are in the business of forecasting the weather as we move forward. So, no, we haven't modeled in any of our forward commentary or outlook impact from weather. Yes, I don't think we can make a distinction between DIY and DIFM from a weather perspective. I mean, 80% of our business is do-it-for-me. So -- but there's no distinction between the two. Thanks, Seth."

            "content": "Thank you, Will and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very proud of our teams as they continue to navigate a dynamic environment and I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights of our first quarter performance. Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no non-recurring items in the first quarter of 2023. However, our comparisons to the prior year do exclude certain non-recurring items in 2022, primarily related to the integration of KDG. Total GPC sales increased 8.9% or $470 million to $5.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This reflects an 8.7% improvement in comparable sales, including mid-single-digit levels of inflation and a 2.4% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 2.2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Overall, our balanced portfolio and global diversification drove record total sales and strong earnings to start the year. Our gross margin was 34.9% in the first quarter, improving 30 basis points from our adjusted gross margin last year, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our pricing and sourcing initiatives. The favorable impact of these and other initiatives contributed approximately 60 basis points of core gross margin improvement. These gains were partially offset by two key headwinds. First, a shift in sales mix related to the strength of our industrial business, which impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points; and second, foreign currency, which also impacted gross margin by approximately 15 basis points. As we highlighted at Investor Day, our ongoing execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin continue to drive strong results. Our total operating and non-operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and in line with the prior year at 27.9% of sales. The increase in expenses in Q1 reflects the combination of solid discipline in managing core costs, offset by planned investments in our teams due to inflationary wage conditions and increased spending in technology to support our ongoing strategic initiatives. As Will noted, with elevated operating costs pressuring margins in the first quarter in our US Automotive business, we have taken actions in March to address these headwinds, which we anticipate to persist into Q2. We expect these cost actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business and the execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our performance in the first quarter generated total segment profit of $526 million, up 16% and a segment profit margin of 9.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of segment margin expansion. Our first quarter net income was $304 million or $2.14 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $266 million or $1.86 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 15%. Our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth is indicative of the hard work and crisp execution by our teams to implement our strategic initiatives across our global operations. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $198 million in cash from operations in the first quarter. This compares to $399 million in cash from operations last year, which included the sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. Free cash flow was $109 million, and we closed the first quarter with $2.1 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.7 times, which compares to our targeted range of two to 2.5 times. We are well-positioned with financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities that may become available across the business. We remain committed to our long history of disciplined capital allocation. Our four key priorities for capital allocation are unchanged and include investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we invested $88 million in capital expenditures, primarily around supply chain and technology. These investments support many of the initiatives we shared at Investor Day that we believe will drive the modernization of our business moving forward. We also invested $40 million for acquisitions, which remains a key element of our growth strategy. As Will mentioned earlier, we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses. For the quarter, we returned $194 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $126 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $68 million of cash used to repurchase 411,000 shares. We are well-positioned with the cash flow to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles. Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on February 23rd and reaffirmed on March 23rd at our Investor Day. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $8.95 to $9.10, an increase of approximately 7% to 9% from 2022. This represents a $0.15 increase from our previous guidance of $8.80 to $8.95. Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following; 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with a 4% to 6% comparable sale increase, and with the ongoing assumption of stronger first half year-on-year sales growth relative to the second half of 2023, although our view on Q2 and Q3 have improved modestly. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are raising our outlook for cash from operations to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion previously. We are raising our outlook for free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of $800 billion [ph] to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others. In closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to the year and positive momentum in our business. While our US Automotive business had a slow start to the year, we've started Q2 with good sales momentum and expect our team to execute, build traction through the second quarter and have a solid second half of 2023. Our outlook for the full year reflects the ongoing confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute through the dynamic economic environment. GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition. As we shared at Investor Day, our team is well positioned to execute our plans to deliver our targets for a double-digit EPS CAGR over the next three years and double-digit margins by 2025. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Yes, Kate, this is Bert. I'll talk a little bit about -- maybe I'll start with the outlook as a starting point, just to give you some context for the full year. I'll talk a little bit about Q2, and then I'll flip it to Will and will give you a little bit more color on the cost actions in US auto specifically. When we think about the full year, we did raise the outlook $0.15. That's a 1.5% increase on the top end of our range, really on the back of a better-than-expected first quarter and our expectations, as we've commented for US Auto to recover against some of these Q1 headwinds and a stronger view on Motion performance over the coming two quarters. When we think about that, I do want to remind everyone that we do expect growth to moderate in 2023. We had exceptional growth in 2021 and 2022. But we're still looking at very solid earnings growth at 7% to 9% year-over-year with the new range. The business continues to perform well. We're going to continue to capitalize on size and scale, and bullish against our execution of our own strategic initiatives. And I think we're off to a great start as we march towards our 2025 targets that we shared on Investor Day. We're obviously being very balanced and being prudent against the external factors that are out there. Inflation levels, foreign currency and the geopolitical landscape, just to name a few. When I think about Q2, just to give you some color there about how we're thinking about the upcoming quarter, we started off in a good place. Global Automotive is in line with April, 7% on the top line. And within that, as Will stated in his prepared remarks, US auto has started off with good momentum in the month of April, accelerating from March. We see continued strength in international auto and the global industrial business momentum is carried into Q2. But, again, we do expect that to normalize against the Q1 rate. Those cost pressures in US Auto, I think, will persist into the early part of Q2 for the balance of the quarter probably, and Will will talk about those just in a moment on what we're doing to get us back to the expected level of performance that we're looking for in the second half. One thing I'd remind you, too, on Q2 is, just as you think about your models, recall that Q2 of 2022 represented our strongest earnings growth last year. And as a result, when we think about our guidance for the full year, the second quarter of 2023 will be -- our expectation will be that it will be our lowest earnings growth rate for this year. So Will, maybe you want to just take that from there and fill in a little bit more specific on the cost actions at US Auto. And Bret, this is Bert Nappier. I'll just add a little bit to that. And you see that effectiveness with our margin -- gross margin expansion here in Q1 up 30 basis points. And within that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 60 basis points of improvement from these activities that Will just outlined. So, the core is really performing well. We had some headwinds from mix and FX, but we're really pleased with how all of that work is flowing through and delivering in terms of gross margin improvement. Hey Josh, it's Bert. I'll take that one, and I'll start kind of at the GPC level. When we think about -- we had margin expansion for gross margin, really, where we're focused on some of that drag is in SG&A. SG&A was up 10 basis points year-over-year. That's really a mix of three factors: inflation, planned investments in the business and then offset by really strong leverage across the business outside of US Auto. For the quarter, when we think about how to really think about the elements, I would say we had SG&A pressure about 50 basis points from those planned investments that we shared at the beginning of the year and again at Investor Day, in IT and talent. Now, some of the talent cost is certainly going to be inflation driven, but we're making very thoughtful investment in talent and IT, which we see as critical for the future. When you look at US Auto, the quarter was impacted by higher personnel costs there and freight delivery costs. So that's the outbound freight from a DC to a store. The wage side was really again the impact of planned investments we made to ensure we're staying competitive. I think everybody is facing that across all businesses and talent is a key part of our long-term success. On the freight side, we're seeing the impact of higher rates from our carriers as they're looking to do the same thing, they're looking to cover higher wages due to driver shortages. So those two things on the automotive side were part of the equation. The other thing I would just say is that, I turn back to this weather consideration. We really didn't anticipate that, as you would expect. None of us are forecasters here in terms of weather. But -- we didn't anticipate some of those weather impacts, particularly coming off the very strong December we had in US Auto. So our staffing models were set to align to a sales run rate where we exited 2022. And that was probably a little bit higher than we needed to support Q1 softer sales level. So all of that together compressed margin in US Auto and was a bit of a headwind for us. As we look ahead, the cost of business is doing a little of doing business is a little higher and inflationary conditions are certainly contributing to that. We're reducing where we can. And again, investments we're making in the business that we shared at Investor Day are a big part of driving efficiency. So while two is kind of take that back to the top level again, and maybe talk about these wage investments in IT and why we think they're so important to us. On the IT side, we're making investments to improve our capabilities and modernize our platforms and Nadeem share that extensively last month. We think those are the right things to do. But in certain cases, the pivot in that space is to cloud-based technology. And as many of you know, that changes the dynamic from a capital to operating costs. And as I shared earlier this year, that's about a 30 basis point drag for us for the year. On the talent side, it's a very competitive market out there for talent. And we're making smart investments with our people with a mid-single-digit wage increase. I think that's in line with most businesses, slightly higher for us than 2022. And we also made the decision to take some of the health care costs we were seeing and absorb them here at the corporate level rather than what we might normally do and pass those on to our employees through higher contributions from them. And that's the right thing for our team right now. So I take that all together, we got a little bit of deleverage for the year 30 to 40 basis points. Those two things are 60. So you can see we're really leveraging outside of that US auto business right now. And with that, we expect margin for the full year to be up 20 to 40 basis points. And as you saw in Q1, we were up 50 basis points. Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one as well. As we look at Q1, inflation moderated slightly during the quarter. That was in line with our expectations. Again, we think monetary policies here in the US and around the world are having the desired effect. But that does take a little time to flow through. Q1 inflation and sales, all GPC total was mid-single digit. Auto was high single digit. And again, industrial, which has been very consistent, low single digits. Our expectation for inflation for the rest of the year is for it to continue to moderate. That's pretty consistent with the view I just shared at Investor Day. Obviously, the actual impact is yet to be seen. But our assumption is that the automotive business will tick down from high single digits to low single digits to close out the year. Industrial will stay in that low single-digit range and that GPC that translates in us going from mid-single digit to low single digits. Chris, this is Bert. So when I talked about 20 to 40 basis points of segment margin improvement, I'm talking about GPC consolidated. I don't really want to get into parsing the onion too finely between the elements of that. But we were not expecting margin declines in either segment for the year. The math would be difficult to achieve 20 to 40 basis points being up consolidated for either of the two segments to be down year-over-year. Look, we had a softer start to the year in US Auto. We've got a great plan here in place with some cost actions we're taking, but it will take a little time to build traction and auger in through the quarter. We're looking for a really solid second half there and building that momentum for us, and we feel good about that. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. It's Bert again. Look, on the cost of ocean freight, those that are included in our inbound and cost of goods sold. My gross margin projection for the year and our guidance assumes we get a bit of a tailwind of that in the second half. That's clearly our expectation. I think that's in line with the market. On the outbound freight, diesel fuel is still up year-over-year just slightly in the quarter. It started out January, I think, in the north of 20%, moderated a bit in February into the teens and then turned positive in March. The net sum of that was about a 3.5% increase for the quarter in fuel cost. And so we had a bit of a headwind there on top of the rates we're getting from the carriers in terms of fuel as it relates to diesel, and that is primary -- that's the primary component of that delivery cost as we think about fuel when it goes from the DC to the store. We would expect that, if March is an indicator that, that will start to tick down a bit and could be a benefit to us. Will mentioned that we've got some actions related to that. On the labor side, I think it's pretty sticky, though. When we think about these carriers, and we're all facing higher wages. Year-over-year, the cost of doing business is undeniably higher because of wage rates, and I don't think those will abate. But we might get a little bit of a tailwind here on the fuel aspect and see how that maps out over the next couple of quarters. Sorry for the long answer. Hi, Liz, it's Bert. Look, there's nothing in the near-term that has really changed or really for the balance of the year in terms of how we're thinking. Interest expense has come down a bit. We've had a little less need to borrow against our revolver intra-month, which has been a bit of a benefit to us and intentional. And then when we think about the uses of cash and our capital allocation for the year, it's still pretty balanced. We don't have anything different than what we shared at Investor Day and no different plans. The only thing that's on the horizon is we've got a debt maturity at the end of the year. And obviously, we'll want to be thinking about the environment that the capital market brings to us as we get closer to that and how we think about refinancing or paying back or some of the various options we might have. So again, just being really disciplined as we always are being faithful to our four priorities on capital allocation and no surprises for you guys. Yes. That's fair to say. Greg, this is Bert. I wouldn't say there's anything fundamental that's changed other than just continued strong momentum and building on the actions in that business over the last couple of years. You build on industrial team that -- and the Motion team that is executing at a very high level, their core business, a stellar integration of KDG and how we've achieved synergy, which was transformational in driving additional size and scale and creating opportunity. That combination has allowed us to continue to improve margin in that business. As we shared at Investor Day, we're looking at that business being at a 12% level. And so, we're marching towards that as a target. And, obviously, this quarter gave you a glimpse of our progression in that regard. And I think we're on the right track to hit that level of profitability as we shared at Investor Day based on what we see right now and what we see for the next several quarters. Thanks, Greg. Well, I don't want to get into giving quarterly guidance on the Industrial segment, but I'll just talk about the full year and tell you that when you think about the industrial business, we've got, as we -- I think we've said repeatedly high single-digit topline growth model for the first half. That moderates down to low single digits in the second half based on our expectation of economic conditions, which could obviously change. Even with all of that, even with a low single-digit outlook for the second half, we're expecting the segment to improve its margin for the full year. Will it be at the same rate as Q1? No. We're not modeling that, and you know that from our full year guidance. But in a lower growth moderated environment in the second half that business will still perform well on a margin basis, and we expect that margin to expand for the full year, which is why we're looking at overall GPC margin expansion for the full year as well. Well, look, I'll just tell you that we spent the last 12 months or so moving down the P&L in terms of inflation impact, starting with the topline and cost of goods sold, I think all businesses, so I don't want to put us in some unique camp. I think all businesses are starting to feel the impact of inflation in the heart of the P&L. And that's now moving into freight lines, SG&A, personnel costs, and some of those things. To call the inning on that is really tough. My dad was a baseball coach, and I like to say that I'm baseball-ready, but the call to inning on that one is a little difficult. I just go back to the point that in this highly inflationary environment, there's no question the floor has been raised on the cost of doing business. It's not just here in the US, it's around the world. And the best indicator for that is what all companies are facing right now with inflation on wages. I don't want to give you a precise estimate on a range of leverage. I think historically, the company has been talking about a 3% to 4%. If it's been 3% to 4%, it's probably floating closer to the higher end of that range. But the thing we're focused on, and I think it underscores and emphasize the importance of doubling down on these investments and initiatives we're making in productivity and efficiency, modernizing our operations, and the things you heard about at Investor Day will help us. And then we're always going to be faithful to driving leverage and reducing costs where we can. And you saw a great example of that in the business this quarter with the leverage we gained in the Motion business and the International Automotive businesses. So, I think that's a great data point on how we're thinking about modeling this going forward. And obviously, my guidance contemplates that as to our 2025 targets. Thanks Daniel."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We were pleased with the continued strength and momentum in our businesses and to report results that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Before I share my comments on the first quarter, I want to share a few thoughts from our 2023 Investor Day, which we hosted just this past month. We use this event to convey our confidence in the bright future of Genuine Parts Company and update everyone on our strategy and the many opportunities we see for long-term profitable growth. During the course of the day, we highlighted our rich history, ongoing transformation and strategic priorities, which we showcased through several key initiatives in an interactive expo. Our panel discussion with our global business unit leaders, allowed us to share specific business and market opportunities and provide insights to the collaboration among our leaders and synergies across the businesses. Finally, we provided three-year financial targets, including a compelling outlook for double-digit EPS CAGR and a double-digit EBITDA and segment profit margin by 2025. It was a great day for the GPC leadership team and hopefully, an informative and productive day for all of our attendees and everyone in the financial community more broadly. If you missed it, we invite you to view the full presentation on our Investor Relations website. So now let's turn to the first quarter. We are proud of the outstanding work by our global GPC teammates, with sales and earnings coming in ahead of our expectations. Our first quarter performance was a clear example of how our strategic transformation to a global automotive and industrial company is a competitive advantage that distinguishes GPC in the marketplace. We benefited from our business mix and the geographic diversity of our operations with continued strong performances in our international automotive businesses and in the industrial segment. A few highlights in the quarter include; record quarterly sales of $5.8 billion, up 9% from the prior year, segment margin of 9.1%, up 50 basis points from 2022. Earnings per share of $2.14, up 15% from adjusted EPS last year, and our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we strengthened our balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation. The global GPC team is focused on driving accelerated sales and earnings growth, continued margin expansion and strong cash flow through dynamic economic conditions. Across our businesses, our teammates are aligned and executing on our strategic plan to deliver outstanding customer service and continued market share gains. In industrial, demand trends held strong throughout the first quarter with new and existing customer activity and reshoring trends each presenting growth opportunities. We believe our continued momentum in industrial is due to the diversity of our product and service offerings and end markets, which all performed well again this quarter. Our acquisition of KDG and enhanced capabilities in industrial solutions, including automation, fluid power and conveyance are proving to be competitive differentiators, and we remain bullish on this business in the near-term. Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the geographic diversity of our markets, which helped to offset the headwinds of a warmer winter and volatile weather conditions in our US automotive business in Q1. In addition, the automotive aftermarket is benefiting from trends such as the ongoing increase in miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet and rising interest rates and continued high prices for new and used vehicles. These are all key drivers to ongoing growth in demand, especially for the DIFM segment, which represents 80% of our global automotive sales. So after delivering back-to-back record years, we are pleased with the solid start to 2023 and we continue to expect another strong year of profitable growth. Looking ahead, we are confident that GPC is well-positioned with the right strategic plans, strong fundamentals, and rock-solid balance sheet to pursue accretive organic and acquisitive investment opportunities while also returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So again, we thank each of our GPC teammates for taking great care of our customers around the world. So now I'll turn the call over to Will. Good morning, Bret. Hey, Greg, this is Paul. I would just cap off both those comments. When you think about the two businesses, Auto and Industrial, and we've talked about this a good bit in the past. We talked about it during Investor Day. If you go back a few years, we laid out our multi-year diversification strategy. And I would tell you, this is a classic quarter where that strategy is really paying dividends. And it's -- and hats off to our teams, our Industrial team, our international teams all really delivered in Q1. We could not be more proud of them. Thank you, Greg. Seth, I've been at this a number of years. It was a crazy, crazy quarter. When I look back at our call in January, we were sitting here in Atlanta, and it was 80 degrees, yet many parts of the country were shut down with incredible snowfall. At this point in time, all we're going to do is we're going to focus on what we can control. And our businesses are all performing at a really high level. We expect that to continue regardless of what Mother Nature has in store for us in the balance of the year. Thanks, Seth. Yes. Thanks, Chad. We appreciate it. And listen, we appreciate all the questions and all of you joining us this morning. As I hope you've heard, we're incredibly pleased with the strong start to the year and we could not be more proud of the great work being done by all of our GPC teammates around the world. We're -- we continue to be excited with the momentum this business is generating. So, I hope you feel that and heard that today in our in our comments. So, listen, all of you have a great day wherever you are and thanks for your interest in GPC."

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. With that, let me turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. As always, I'd like to start by thanking our global teammates for their hard work serving our customers. And I'd also like to acknowledge all those who were negatively impacted by the devastating hurricanes in the U.S. I'm proud of our teams as they rally together to take care of each other and our customers. Our culture shines through with our teammates going above and beyond to navigate the challenge. Taking care of our communities is a pillar of our mission at GPC and we'll continue to support impacted communities through our partners at the American Red Cross. Let me also welcome Jenn Hulett to GPC. Jenn joined GPC in August as our new Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer, responsible for advancing the company's global talent and culture initiatives. This is a critical area of focus as we continuously strive to be an employer of choice. We look forward to Jenn's many contributions. Before I get into the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the business and share my perspective after nearly six months in the role as CEO. GPC has a great legacy. NAPA will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. Motion is a market-leading value-added industrial solutions business founded in 1946 and our international automotive businesses in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada have similar long proud histories. Together, GPC is a differentiated business with compelling opportunities individually and collectively as one GPC team in each of the global markets we serve. As we leverage the size, scale and strength of our company in our fragmented industries, we're intensely focused on evolving the business and leaning into the initiatives around talent and culture, technology, supply chain and sales effectiveness that we shared at our last Investor Day. Transformation and investment across all industries is critical as customers' needs and markets continue to evolve at increasing speeds. I'm confident that we're doing the right hard work for GPC's long-term benefit as we look to not only extend our existing competitive advantages, but also create new ones. Most importantly, our legacy has created financial strength, both in terms of our cash flow and our balance sheet to thoughtfully pursue these actions through business cycles. Our capital allocation discipline is elevated as we work to methodically balance foundational, growth and innovative investments across the most attractive and strategic GPC opportunities. In parallel, we're committed to growing our long-standing dividend. We acknowledge that these strategic investments come with near-term trade-offs, including higher costs that are amplified by sluggish market conditions and an underlying inflationary cost environment, in turn pressuring results as seen in the third quarter. We're balancing the medium and long-term by offsetting current headwinds with a back-to-basics customer and operational excellence mindset, which is gaining traction as evidenced by improved internal operating metrics. We're also managing core operating costs through global restructuring activities, which are on track to deliver the intended impact. And we continuously pursue initiatives to simplify the business and further enhance our productivity. As we close out 2024 and look ahead to 2025, I want to highlight select examples of actions that reinforce our enthusiasm for GPC's future. At Motion, we continue to extend our value proposition with our customers with tools, technology and expertise to drive embedded solutions that create value and efficiency for our customers. Further, our investments in automation to address customers' productivity needs and mobilizing our technical sales expertise to capitalize on reshoring and nearshoring activity present meaningful new opportunities for us. At our U.S. automotive business, we've invested in inventory to drive better availability by broadening our assortment, while simultaneously improving operational productivity. These investments, combined with actions to improve our delivery times from stores have strengthened our daily value proposition. The quality of the NAPA brand is differentiated and our longstanding local relationships, geographic footprint and expertise position us to continue to lead in the do-it-for-me segment. The recently announced refinement to the U.S. automotive operating model will drive greater commercial opportunities in key markets across the U.S., improving revenue growth and profitability over time. Underpinning these activities are critical investments in technology, that include automation of DCs with next generation robotics, enhancements to the customer digital experience, including better search and catalog capabilities and modernization of our store systems. These investments will position us to deliver a better customer experience and capture growth moving forward. We're also leveraging 250 world-class engineers at our global tech center in Krakow, Poland to build software for global initiatives, including innovative products with emerging technology. And finally, by leaning into our One GPC operating philosophy, we're unlocking the synergies that exist between our automotive and industrial businesses globally, with meaningful value creation opportunities ahead as we implement as an example, our reenergized approach to IT collaboration across the globe to simplify and harmonize our operations. In total, our initiatives are designed to create a better customer experience and generate growth in excess of the market, reduce costs and deliver attractive returns. All our efforts are at different levels of maturity, but all have exciting runway. Our operating cadence as a global leadership team is designed to challenge ourselves and each other, each day to be faster, smarter and better. The decisions to pursue long-term investment are difficult in the face of near-term market headwinds. But we believe, that these investments will increase the intrinsic value of GPC over time. Our financial results were obviously below our expectations in the third quarter, driven by various market factors that we expect to be temporary in nature. But we are confident that we're doing the right body of work to make the company better. Now turning to the third quarter. Note that our results include the impacts of two major hurricanes, Beryl and Helene and the start of the fourth quarter has been affected by Hurricane Milton. For the third quarter, total GPC sales were approximately $6 billion, an increase of 2.5% year-over-year due to the benefits of an extra selling day in the U.S. and acquisitions, particularly in U.S. automotive. However, continued softness in market conditions across our global geographies negatively impacted our sales growth in the quarter relative to our expectations, with the most pronounced impacts in Europe and our global industrial business. The weaker demand environment continues to be impacted by interest rates, combined with persistent cost inflation and election and geopolitical uncertainty. These factors are impacting our customers, most notably with tightened budgets and reduced spending for capital projects in our industrial business and reduced spending in general maintenance and discretionary categories across our automotive segment. The weak sales environment along with cost pressure in wages and rent expense plus anticipated headwinds from depreciation and interest expense resulted in adjusted earnings being down year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $1.88, down from $2.49 last year. Our results for the third quarter missed our expectations. Our outlook in July, included anticipated improvements in market conditions in Europe and global industrial activity, neither of which materialized. Our original expectation for the third quarter included flat industrial sales growth. Actual reported results ended up down low-single-digits. In Europe, we expected low-single-digit organic growth, actual results ended up flat. The combination of these market headwinds contributed to over $140 million in lower sales in the quarter versus our expectations. Given our results to-date and our expectation that these weaker market conditions will likely persist for the balance of the year, we've adjusted our 2024 outlook accordingly. While many of these factors are outside of our control, we remain focused on controlling what we can and we're confident in eventual market tailwinds. Bert will provide a clear explanation of the impact of hurricanes, variation drivers versus prior year and our third quarter expectations, as well as our updated outlook in his prepared comments shortly. Looking at our results by business segment. During the third quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% versus the same period last year and comparable sales were down 2%. During the quarter, we had one extra selling day, compared to the third quarter of last year, which positively impacted total sales growth by approximately 140 basis points. Looking at the cadence for the quarter, average daily sales were down mid-single-digits in July, relatively flat in August and down mid-single-digits in September. Lagging industrial production activity continues to be the main headwind for our industrial business, as we're now in the longest period of contraction for PMI in over 33-years. While this period of contraction has lasted longer than many expected, history does show us that we typically see a long period of attractive growth once the index inflects into expansion territory. During the third quarter, three of our 14 end-markets we track showed positive average daily sales growth year-over-year. We saw relative strength coming from pulp and paper and our distribution and logistics segment, which was offset by weakness in equipment and machinery, lumber and wood and iron and steel. Within industrial, our core MRO business has remained relatively flat year-over-year with continued strength across corporate accounts through the year. However, customer spending related to capital projects, which represents approximately 20% of sales has been down mid-single-digits versus prior year. We continue to hear from customers considering capital projects that they are pausing, not canceling these plans until they have better visibility into the interest rate environment and the outcome of the election in the U.S. As the market leader, Motion is well positioned to capitalize on the eventual improvement in the manufacturing economy, near and long-term to expand our customer base and profitably grow share of wallet in this highly fragmented market. As a testament to Motion's value proposition and customer service, Motion has already received Supplier of the Year awards from six of its largest 25 customers in 2024, surpassing the total it received in the previous four years combined. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was $259 million, down approximately 8% versus prior year and 11.9% of sales, representing an approximate 100 basis point decrease from the same period last year, driven by sales deleverage combined with wage inflation and higher depreciation expense. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the third quarter were $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately 5% with comparable store sales up slightly. During the quarter, we had one extra selling day in the U.S., compared to prior year, which positively impacted Global Automotive sales growth by approximately 90 basis points. Similar to the first half of the year, the Global Automotive sales benefit from inflation remained less than 1% in the third quarter and we expect the same in the fourth quarter. Global Automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $262 million, down approximately 19% versus prior year and 6.9% of sales, down from 8.9% of sales in the same period last year. Our third quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflect ongoing pressures from a soft sales environment and cost pressures, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Now let's turn to our Automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our team delivered total sales growth of approximately 6% in local currency with comparable sales flat. During the third quarter, overall market growth remained muted, down low-single-digits, which was consistent with the second quarter. The weak economic backdrop in Europe is being driven by an elevated level of deferred maintenance attributable to real wage declines, unemployment, higher interest rates and uncertain political and geopolitical situations. In addition, the benefit from same SKU inflation was less than 1%, while the prior year benefit was mid-single-digits. As we look at the economic backdrop in three key European markets; Germany, France and the U.K., higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumer purchasing power across these three geographies. Furthermore, higher unemployment rates and real wage declines in France and Germany have contributed to softer spending at the consumer level. Collectively, these factors are driving weak consumer confidence across the three markets. Despite this challenging environment, our team continues to outpace the market growth and win share, driven in part by our initiatives with key accounts and the rollout of the NAPA brand, which is a competitive differentiator. In the Asia Pac Automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 7% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 4%. Sales for both commercial and retail increased in the third quarter with continued strength in retail, particularly in Australia. The macro environment is also challenging in the region with Australia experiencing the weakest economic growth in nearly three decades and New Zealand currently is in its second recession in 18-months. However, our teams are executing well, extending our industry-leading position and taking market share. In Canada, sales increased 1% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales decreasing 1%. Our Canadian team continues to perform despite ongoing pressure from a more cautious consumer and difficult macro environment. Sales in automotive and heavy vehicle performed similar in -- during the quarter, with both having positive growth. Lastly, in the U.S., Automotive sales increased 4% during the third quarter with comparable sales essentially flat. The extra day versus the same quarter last year positively impacted sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Our growth was also driven by acquisitions, most notably the acquisition of MPEC that we completed in May. The sales results were broadly in line with our expectations as we believe we're benefiting from the actions that we've detailed over the last few quarters to improve our execution, and we're seeing a positive impact in the marketplace. Our average daily sales cadence through the quarter was positive in all three months with July being the softest month. Sales to our commercial customers increased low-single-digits in the quarter while sales to do-it-yourself customers was down mid-single digits. Within Commercial, fleet and government, auto care and other wholesale were all positive, while major accounts underperformed the Group, but improved sequentially as we remain focused on profitable growth within the major account segment. On a comparable basis, sales from company-owned stores were slightly positive, while comparable sales into our independent stores were down slightly. More broadly for U.S. Automotive, to provide additional perspective on the cautious consumer, on a year-to-date basis, our non-discretionary repair categories, which accounts for approximately 50% of NAPA's business were up low to mid-single-digits. Our general maintenance categories, which represents approximately 35% of our business, were flat year-over-year, driven by continued cautious end-consumer, who is deferring certain service and maintenance-related purchases. Discretionary categories, representing approximately 15% of the business, were down mid-single-digits. We continue to invest in our U.S. Automotive business for growth and build on significant improvements in service over the past year. During the quarter, we further invested in inventory, increasing the SKU coverage in our company-owned stores by approximately 10%, while driving further productivity in our DCs, which resulted in a more than 8% increase in our internal DC service metrics. We're encouraged with the continued progress and have seen a material improvement in our customer service and store delivery metrics. We will obviously, continue to stay focused on this important effort. Going forward, we see the commercial customer as the growth engine of our industry and we benefit from the fact that 80% of NAPA's business serves this segment. Our continuous improvement on inventory availability, service and product quality position us well to win in the markets that we serve. Following our successful acquisition of the MPEC business in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of our next largest owner, Walker Automotive Supply in August, furthering our plan to own more of our stores in strategic priority markets. We added approximately 70 NAPA stores across North Carolina. Year-to-date, we've made strategic acquisitions of more than 450 NAPA stores from our independent owners, as well as competitive stores in key markets, including approximately 160 in the third quarter. Our store network in the U.S. is now comprised of over 6,000 stores, of which approximately 35% are company-owned, up from approximately 25% at the end of 2022. Over time, we see a path to bring our network closer to a 50-50 mix with our independent owners continuing to play a critical role in our network. While our quarterly financial results were below our expectations, we are confident that we are investing in the right areas to better position GPC and we're experiencing traction across numerous efforts. We believe, the current market softness is temporary and will eventually serve as a tailwind. The long-term fundamentals of our industries are attractive and our businesses are well-established with leadership positions. We're balancing near-term actions and medium and long-term investments. Disciplined and consistent investment in our business, particularly during temporary periods of broad weaker industry dynamics will strengthen our leadership positions and earn profitable market share and create value. In closing, thank you again to our global teams for the leadership and hard work. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of several factors; weak market conditions, the cost impact of investments we are making in the business and disruptions from the CrowdStrike outage in July and two major hurricanes. The third quarter was challenging and in evaluating our financial results and to provide additional transparency, we reflected on three key themes, which I will address, along with an update on our cash flows and capital allocation. Those themes are, what drove our profitability down year-over-year, how did the quarter differ from our expectations and what is our outlook for the remainder of 2024. My comments this morning will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the non-recurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program and costs related to the acquisition of MPEC and Walker. During the third quarter, we incurred a total of $45 million of pretax costs or $36 million after-tax related to the restructuring efforts and integration activities. Before I review our three key themes in detail, let me share some high level context for our results, starting with sales. Total sales were up 2.5% in the third quarter, which included a benefit from acquisitions of 320 basis points and the benefit of an additional selling day in the U.S. totaling 110 basis points. Sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by disruptions from Hurricanes Helene and Beryl, as well as the CrowdStrike outage, totaling approximately 70 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin was 36.8%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. The improvement in our gross margin was driven by acquisitions, primarily at U.S. Automotive, which drove approximately 60 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to cost, our SG&A as a percentage of sales for the third quarter was 28.8%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. The impact of acquired businesses, investments in IT and cost pressures contributed to the year-over-year deleverage. More specifically, our MPEC and Walker acquisitions negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 50 basis points. The incremental SG&A from acquired businesses will abate over time as we execute on our integration plans and capture synergies. We are now five months and two months post close of our MPEC and Walker transactions respectively, and expect each respective integration to take approximately 24 months from start to finish. Our integration efforts are on track with respect to timing and synergy capture. Both acquisitions contributed positively to our EBITDA margin in the third quarter. Inflation-driven increases in rent expense and salaries and wages, including increased minimum wages in certain international markets, along with service improvement investments in freight expense resulted in approximately 120 basis points of SG&A deleverage versus the prior year. In addition, our planned investments in technology to modernize our business resulted in a 20 basis points headwind in SG&A in the third quarter. Our global restructuring initiative remains on track. Our restructuring efforts are a key element of our work to offset the headwinds of current market conditions and cost inflation across the business. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $160 million of costs related to our restructuring efforts, in-line with the top end of our range of $100 million to $200 million of costs. During the third quarter, we realized approximately $16 million in benefits from our restructuring efforts and expect to deliver a benefit of between $30 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis, in-line with our expectations. With that context, let's turn to the first theme. Our third quarter profitability. Our third quarter results were down year-over-year from an adjusted EPS of $2.49 to an adjusted EPS of $1.88, a decline of $0.61. As we look at the details, I will describe the major drivers of our year-over-year decline in terms of impact to EPS, and you can see these illustrated in our earnings presentation. First, as we expected, higher depreciation and interest expense, combined with IT costs I referenced in my SG&A comments drove approximately $0.25 of the year-over-year decline in earnings. Our initiatives come with cost headwinds, which we anticipated and planned for in 2024. These costs are in the form of higher depreciation expense as we depreciate new investments, higher SG&A as our efforts to modernize IT show up in operating expense and higher interest expense from borrowings to fund investments, particularly in this higher interest rate environment. As I mentioned, core cost inflation is negatively impacting salaries and wages along with rent expense and we are making investments to improve service that are contributing to higher freight expense. For the quarter, these higher costs combined with deleverage on lower sales reduced our year-over-year earnings by an estimated $0.38. These negative impacts were partially offset by benefits of our global restructuring actions totaling $0.08. Finally, the quarter was negatively impacted by lost revenues as a result of the impacts of disruptions from the hurricanes and the CrowdStrike outage, which translated into an estimated $0.06 reduction in earnings for the quarter. With respect to Hurricane Helene, we closed September with approximately 200 locations across NAPA and Motion impacted by power outages and storm damage. Many of these locations have come back online, but we continue to operate with closed stores and disrupted customers. With respect to the second theme related to our expectations, we underperformed, where we expected to be in the third quarter. As we shared in our second quarter earnings call, we expected weak market conditions and headwinds from depreciation, IT investments and interest to result in lower third quarter earnings, and we were targeting an adjusted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.25. Our adjusted results for the quarter with EPS of $1.88 came in below our expectations, driven by two key factors, weaker results in Europe and our industrial business and the impact of CrowdStrike and the hurricanes. When we gave guidance in July, our outlook assumes sequential improvement in market conditions in the second-half of 2024, and tailwinds from easing comparisons. More specifically, our original expectations for the third quarter included industrial sales growth coming in flat and low-single-digit organic European growth. Underlying European market conditions did not inflect in the quarter and remain negative on a sequential basis from the second quarter. For industrial, PMI closed June at 48.5%, nearly flat to May and then turned sharply negative in July at 46.8%, rebounding slightly to 47.2% in both August and September. Along with negative industrial production manufacturer readings in September, this backdrop resulted in our sales for industrial in the third quarter being down. As Will shared, the underperformance of our European and industrial businesses versus our expectations translated into $140 million in reduced sales or an estimated $0.30 of earnings. When combined with a $0.06 impact from CrowdStrike and the hurricanes, this led to an approximate $0.36 earnings shortfall versus our expectations. Our third quarter performance, which was largely driven by ongoing weak market conditions, led us to the third theme, our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Based on the trends we are seeing in our business, including our lower-than-expected third quarter performance, we are adjusting our 2024 outlook. With no sequential improvement in market conditions in the third quarter from the second quarter, our revised outlook reflects our view that the demand environment for the balance of the year will remain consistent with the third quarter. We now expect that diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $6.60 to $6.80, compared to our previous outlook of $8.55 to $8.75. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $8 to $8.20. This compares to our previous outlook of a range of $9.30 to $9.50. Our earnings presentation includes an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our revised outlook for 2024. Let me take a moment and walk you through the details of these components, starting with sales. We now expect total sales growth in a range of up 1% to 2% versus our previous outlook of up 1% to 3%, which includes the benefit of acquisitions we've made year-to-date. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following. 3% to 4% total sales growth for the automotive segment, which includes the benefit of acquisitions made year-to-date. We anticipate comparable sales growth to be approximately flat. And for the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth to be down 1% to 2% with comparable sales growth also down 1% to 2%. Our reduced sales outlook for the year is driven by updated expectations around market conditions. For the balance of 2024, we do not expect any improvement in market conditions across our geographies. Our expectations are informed by third-party data, as well as the trends we experienced in the third quarter, which have persisted into the start of the fourth quarter. Further, the beginning of the quarter has been compounded by the impacts of hurricane Milton across Florida as well as the continuing effects of Hurricane Helene. While we've made good progress on restoring our operations, uncertainty remains around our customers and their ability to resume operations, which makes the ultimate impact on our business difficult to predict. Our updated guidance includes our estimated impact of these storms on our results for the remainder of the year. Within industrial, the weak industrial production activity remains a headwind for the business. As Will mentioned, we are now in the longest period of contraction for PMI in over 33-years. We now believe that improvement won't come in 2024 as we wait for PMI to inflect into expansionary territory and for the benefit of initial interest rate cuts to have a positive impact on our customers. In our International and U.S. Automotive businesses, market conditions continue to remain soft as consumers are impacted by a wide range of factors, including inflation, interest rates and geopolitical election uncertainty. In the U.S., while our independent owners continue to gain strength, high interest rates remain a headwind for these small and medium business owners. For gross margin, we continue to expect 40 basis points to 60 basis points of full year gross margin expansion, primarily driven by the acquisitions in U.S. Automotive and our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 140 basis points and 150 basis points, which includes SG&A deleverage on our reduced sales outlook, ongoing cost inflation and the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the U.S. Automotive business. Our views include the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For Global Automotive segment margin, we now expect to be down approximately 90 basis points to 100 basis points versus last year, given the softer organic sales growth and corresponding pressure on SG&A. For 2024, we expect Global Industrial segment margin to be down approximately 40 basis points to 50 basis points year-over-year. For the first nine months of 2024, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $700 million in free cash flow. We are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. Delivering consistent cash flows in all business cycles, combined with our liquidity, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation philosophy positions us to grow the business long-term. In 2024, we have invested approximately $386 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $126 million in the third quarter. With respect to capital expenditures, as we shared at our Investor Day in 2023, our historical investment rate in our business hovered at around 1% or less of revenue. Over the past two years to drive the needed transformation of our business, this has moved to 2% of our revenue and we continue to expect an investment rate of 2% of revenue or approximately $500 million in spending in 2024. The growth capital we are deploying, which represents approximately 55% of our total 2024 CapEx will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs and automation, that when partnered with technology enhances our customer experience and positions us for long term growth. Further, disciplined M&A has been a key element of our growth as we take advantage of value creation opportunities in our fragmented markets globally. In 2024, our M&A strategy has evolved with respect to our operating model at NAPA and our new approach to having a more balanced mix of company owned and independently owned stores will improve our revenue growth and profitability over the long-term. We have invested $954 million globally year-to-date in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our now largest independent owner, Walker Automotive Supply. As we acquire these businesses, we have a disciplined integration playbook where we extract value through incremental sales opportunities, capture the full gross margin and optimize the SG&A of the acquired business. During the third quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by initiating the transition of our U.S. pension plan to a third-party insurance company, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025. This is a continuation of our pension de-risking strategy that began in 2013, when the plan was frozen and does not impact the benefits of the planned participants. Our pension plan is well funded and we took this step to reduce balance sheet and income statement volatility and protect us from future potential cash flow contributions. We anticipate a one-time non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2025 and do not expect any impact to our 2024 financial results. Further, we do not expect any cash payments associated with the transfer of the plan to the third party insurance company in 2025. In closing, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions including advancing our global restructuring activities to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. We believe, the backdrop of lower growth is market driven, not specific to our business, and we stand well positioned for growth once the cycle turns more favorable. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the recent reduction in interest rates in the U.S. and are optimistic that lower rates will create a more constructive market backdrop moving forward. Although, we recognize that this will take time to result in improved activity. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and we'll continue to invest in the business with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Thanks for all the detail on the call today. One area that we wanted to learn a little bit more was just the detail around the inventory increase you saw during the quarter. And if you could maybe drill down into some of the investments that you're making in freight?\nBert Nappier: Sure, Kate. Good morning. Look, on the inventory side, I think that goes back to really some of what Will touched on and positioning us in the marketplace on the NAPA side. We've made some great strides on getting inventory availability, where it needs to be. That's a year-over-year kind of effort. We started that this time last year, as you recall. And I think we've really made some nice moves to increase depth, increase SKU count and do the things that matter in the field. We know that inventory availability is the deciding factor in being successful, NAPA's great legacy, it's got a great brand, it's got a great footprint. And so when we put that inventory power behind it, I think it really positions us well in the marketplace. That's the biggest driver of the change there. We also have some acquired inventory from the acquisitions we've made. So that will show up in the balance sheet as well. In terms of investments at freight, some of those are a bit competitively sensitive. I would just leave it at the fact that we're really leaning into making sure that, we've got on the other side of the equation, that store excellence, making sure, we have the driver availability and consistency of experience that we want to make sure, we're meeting the needs of our customers.\nWill Stengel: Kate, I might just add, as we look at all the internal operating metrics that we use to run the business, in particular in NAPA, we continue to be very bullish about the progress that we've made. So whether it's service levels from deliveries to stores, from DCs, from stores to customers, those are at all-time highs and getting better every day. As Bert said, the inventory strategy was all about making sure that we had the right vendor alignment with the right availability in the local markets and those have seen material improvement year-over-year. Safety is better in our DCs, inventory breadth and depth, as Bert alluded to, has never been better. So we've added deeper and wider inventory while using our existing supply chain. Voluntary turnover is down 30% plus year-over-year. And importantly, we're seeing about 100 basis point improvement in our customer metrics in terms of their satisfaction. So as we're running the business and putting these investments in, we feel good about the returns that are associated with them.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Kate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes. So you did not call out U.S. auto as a primary source of profit disappointment in the quarter? Does that mean U.S. margins held up and the total margin decline was really due to the international business? Or does that mean you just had subdued expectations for U.S. auto? And then secondly, obviously, '24 is going to fall well below initial expectations. Without providing any specific guidance, can you give us a general feel for how you're thinking about '25, meaning the sequential trends continue to weaken, but your comparisons get easier, et cetera? Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Hey, Scot, it's Bert. Look, on the margin side for U.S. Automotive, we don't really get into the details by the individual regions. I will say that the pressure we felt at the consolidated level was consistent across all the markets. And so, we were disappointed in total with where we were. It came in underneath our expectations as we've outlined. But I wouldn't isolate the pressure in any one market regionally around the world versus the other. They're all feeling the same kind of pressure. Interest rate pressure in all of our markets on the automotive side, cost inflation are both present in all of those markets. And so, when we think about the factors that drove SG&A, that I outlined in my prepared comments, those would be true for each of the regions individually. In terms of how we're looking ahead, and as you said, we don't want to get too specific. But look, I mean, I think the bottom line on 2025, is that we're going to continue to watch all the same data that you all are. And at this point, as we exit the third quarter and start the fourth quarter and start to look into 2025, those conditions remain pretty stagnant quarter-over-quarter. And so, market conditions are going to be a big factor in how we look at things. The bottom line though, is we're very encouraged by the long-term fundamentals for both segments. And we're in great fixed industries. I think those are beneficial to us in the long-term. Our size and scale is a benefit there as well. We have leadership positions in fragmented markets around the globe, and we're bullish on the execution of our strategic initiatives as Will outlined. But the biggest wildcard moving ahead with that positive backdrop is the pace and timing of recovery of market conditions. And so we'll take the fourth quarter to see what we think the market will give us for next year, plus our own actions and the things that we think we're going to be able to do and we'll update that and share that with you in February.\nWill Stengel: Scott, I might just add in the same way that we've articulated the higher interest rates have had the intended effect muting and slowing down overall growth, we are encouraged, obviously by the start of an easing scenario around the world. The U.K. has reduced rates once in the last, call it, six months, U.S. once, Eurozone 3 times, Canada 3 times. So obviously, there'll be a lag benefit to that, but we would hope as we move forward, those types of policy decisions provide a tailwind as opposed to a headwind.\nScot Ciccarelli: Great. Thanks, guys.\nBert Nappier: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Your SG&A dollars were up about $166 million in the quarter versus the same year ago. Can you outline a bit more what drove that increase? And should we expect the pace of increase to continue for the next several quarters given the investments that you're making?\nBert Nappier: Hey, Michael, good morning. Look, a big part of the dollar increase in SG&A is going to come from acquired businesses. So I think that's an isolated activity, particularly here as you look in the second half of 2024 with the acquisition of our two largest independent owners on the NAPA side of the house. So I kind of outlined that and detailed that in my prepared remarks. On that particular point, we would expect that SG&A to abate over time as we continue to integrate those businesses and capture synergies. The great news is we're on track on that front. We're seeing our synergy capture come in consistent with our business case. And as I shared, both of those acquisitions contributed positively to our third quarter. As we look ahead on some of those other elements, I think we'll continue to see pressure here in the near-term on the cost side of things with inflationary impacts on wages and rent. I don't expect those to abate in the fourth quarter. And likewise, we're going to continue to invest in IT, that's an important part of our transformation going forward. And there's some positive things there. Unfortunately, as we modernize systems, many of those are cloud-based platforms that transition expense out of capital into operating expense, which is why we're highlighting that for you. But we're also making some great investments in the business, in particular with our Global Technology center in Poland. We benefit from exceptional talent, high productivity and these teams are doing amazing work on some of our initiatives around catalog and search, which is clearly making a difference with our customers. So when we think about investment, that's an example of a thing I think you'll continue to see. But at the same time, we're also trying to be very thoughtful about offsetting some of this with our global restructuring, which remains on track. We saw a benefit in the quarter as we've discussed, and we're continuing to control headcount. The restructuring is helping with that. Most of that has come from voluntary retirements in the U.S. But if we look at our global headcount, we're down somewhere between 3% and 5% in 2024, excluding acquisitions. And we're continuing to do hard work across the network with engineering standards and engineering productivity and RDCs that's reducing over time and allowing us to be more thoughtful about headcount there as well.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is, your decision to make incremental investments in the decision -- in the business was inevitably prompted by something. You outlined your view that U.S. Auto business was down. Your business was flattish. So what is motivating the decision to make these investments? And how do you expect the return on these investments to play out in the next few quarters in terms of market share? Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Yes. Look, Michael, I think it's super important for any business to be investing in itself. And so I think as the management team organized their strategic plan, in particular, dating back to our Investor Day in 2023, we had a lot of compelling opportunities to invest back in the business in a different way, which I think is a function of the market realities, the changing technology landscape, the competitive dynamic. And so all those things put together set the stage for putting capital to work around the world in an accelerated way.\nBert Nappier: And Michael, I'll just add that I believe, that if you looked prior to Investor Day in 2023, you would have seen the GPC business in totality spending about 1% of revenue in terms of investment in the business. And so that's across all of our business segments. And that quite frankly, I think is not the level of investment we needed to stay at pace and grow this business and keep it on its front foot going forward. We think the technology work that we're doing and leading with technology is going to be a differentiator. And we think investing in our supply chains, which will make a difference for our customers, and as we know, having that part and having it at the right place and the right time, both on the Automotive and the Industrial side is critical to being successful. And as we make these enhancements across DCs, which we've mentioned, we're doing that in the U.K. and France, here in the U.S., we have a new DC in Melbourne, we're doing this all over the world. And you combine that with the technology, I think that's going to position us for a much stronger growth, particularly as we come out of this weaker economic cycle.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. So my first question is, I just want to be clear. So was there a decision to step up investments above the original plan for this year or is it really just the acquisitions? And as we think about moving forward, do the acquisitions that you made during this quarter -- during the third quarter take sort of the underlying dollar run-rate higher as we look at the fourth quarter, obviously, relative to revenues?\nBert Nappier: Yes. Chris, we haven't changed our view on investment level on CapEx for 2024. We're still going to come in right around that 2% level. And as I commented in my prepared remarks, that's going to be around $500 million of investment. So there's no step up on the CapEx side of the house. We really think the 2% number is the right proxy. We did that last year. We'll do that again this year and we'll be thoughtful about how we look ahead to 2025. In terms of run rate on acquisition, I think, I would tell you that we expect that to -- that was never going to be linear. I think it's the best way to say it when you think about the independent owner strategy. As you've seen this year, we've acquired the two largest. And from there, acquiring 180 plus stores in May, as we've announced with Walker 75 stores, the next levels of independent owners drop pretty significantly in terms of store count size. And so I think you'll see, while we continue to march to maybe a more 50-50 target, the pace and timing of that will slow. So I think we get the first two big ones, which were important to do in the Q first and then we'll move at pace, but the pace will decelerate from what you've seen here over the last two quarters.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then as you think about just, what are we expecting, what are like implied same-store sales and organic growth in NAPA and Motion? And as you look out and you think about the industrial side of the business, does the election sort of like -- is that a clearing event or do we have to wait for these capital budgets to come through for your customers in 2025, such that this actually could prolong to perhaps the second quarter when that capital gets deployed?\nWill Stengel: Chris, I would say the election is a clearing event with a lag. So by the time you turn the calendar year, the election flips and there's at least kind of clarity on the margin relative to where we stand today, especially with the backdrop of lower rates. And I think that helps.\nChris Horvers: In the implied comps for the fourth quarter.\nBert Nappier: Not for the fourth quarter. I would say, the lag is coming into 2025. I don't think the election clarity in November, creates a business impact immediately in November and December.\nWill Stengel: And look, Chris, we don't give quarterly guidance. So the quarter comps we haven't provided. But I would just say, I'd go back to my thoughts in the prepared remarks, we really don't expect the fourth quarter thematically to look much different than the third quarter in terms of the underlying performance of the business given the market conditions.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And I just want to ask one clarification question. So I think you talked about a $0.30 EPS headwind on $140 million shortfall in sales, is that right? Because that's like a 40% operating margin, I guess, ask the other way. If you expected sales up 2.5% next year, you would expect that -- next year, you expect 40% flow through on that.\nBert Nappier: No, I wouldn't take it that way, Chris. I mean, I think we're trying to give you a reasonable proxy of what we felt like the sales loss was. I mean, given the gross margin rate impact of that and the lost sales in the quarter. So I wouldn't overread into that in terms of operating margin.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions. I wanted to start maybe, at a high level, given that I think Bert, you described the investments ramping up to 2% now versus 1%. When we think about the growth algo that you outlined at the Analyst Day in '23, should we be thinking about this year as a new base to build that off of or should we still go back to where we were a couple of years ago and have the growth off of that base.\nBert Nappier: I think this year is a tough year to use as a proxy, Greg, is my kind of initial response to that. We've had a lot of moving pieces. Market conditions have moved backwards. I think as you look historically, we've said that the growth algorithm is in that 3% to 4% top line range in the long, long term for the business in terms of top line and that we can lever off of that. This year with market conditions, particularly on the industrial side moving negative, it's not a year I would use as a proxy. So I don't think we're ready to move off of what we think are long-term algorithms, but obviously, we reserve the right to kind of update you as we get into 2025 and the 2025 guidance, particularly as we see with what the fourth quarter presents and how we think the beginning of 2025 will start. So let's not deviate from how we think about the health of this business on a long-term basis, as Will has said, I think we're very bullish on what the long-term can be and the investments we're making in the business. Those have stepped up from a 1% historical rate, but that 2% is the same level of investment we shared with you at Investor Day. So we think that does set a little bit of a new proxy there. But again, we'll come back to you with some more thoughtful outlook when we get to February.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then my follow-up was you mentioned how dis-inflation has brought inflation down in both industrial and auto to sub 1%. Can you remind us of how that cycles, if you think about the comparisons from a year ago. And should that -- should we expect that to normalize back at maybe the long-term 2% to 3%? Or do you think we're sort of stuck at this flattish position?\nBert Nappier: Look, again, I'll always reserve my right to update you when we build our models for 2025 and share those in February. But I think we're coming out of the period that we all expected. We saw this start last year in 2023 in the U.S., and we're seeing it now in Europe. We expected those high benefits of inflation in the top line to cool off, and they have. We're going through what I think is the unwinding of all that now. And again, if I go back to the first question about the long-term, if you think the long-term is a 3% to 4%, embedded in that long-term is a 0.5% to 1% range of price benefit. And we would expect in the long-term, absent something else coming to light that changes our view on the health of the markets fundamentally, that would be the case and we would vert to something more normalized as we move ahead.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then last, I would just say how would you look -- how would you describe your market share positioning right now in U.S. auto and Industrial. I mean, I know there's a lot of macro headwinds. Do you think you're gaining share, holding share still slipping a little bit?\nWill Stengel: No, we feel really good about it. And we use on the NAPA side a third-party independent data that's got everybody's information in it and it's never been stronger, always opportunities. There's 120 categories that you have to look at to study SKU level share and we've made incredible progress there. So -- and then on the industrial side, we're right there or better than the market. There's some data points out there from peers and obviously, the PMI. So down a little bit in this market is at or better than market performance.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Thanks and good luck, guys.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Melich.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. Just following up on Greg's last question, thinking about the U.S. market, your comps were flattish ex the extra day sequentially, and slowed materially onto your stack basis. Do you think that market conditions got worse or do you think that the competitive environment got more difficult this quarter relative to last?\nWill Stengel: I think the markets got worse and the hurricane impacts put noise into the data. So a flattish market feels about right to us, a plus or minus a point.\nBert Nappier: And on the second part of that Seth, on the competitive set, I mean, I wouldn't say that the competitive sets changed much. We have great competitors. We compete day-to-day with a competitive landscape that, thankfully remains very rational on pricing. And so we're encouraged by NAPA's position in the market as I said earlier, with its great footprint, legacy availability and quality.\nSeth Basham: And specific to the major account segment that you talked about getting a little bit better this quarter, what's driving that. Do you think it's the end markets. Do you think it's some of your initiatives? Any color there would be appreciated.\nWill Stengel: Yes. So we were really pleased with the sequential improvement in major accounts. As I think, we've talked about publicly before, inside our major accounts, we have four or five different books of business and each have their own specific initiatives. And those initiatives are gaining traction, specifically around some of our priorities in our regional quote, unquote major accounts and our independent affiliates. So we're focused intentionally there to make sure that, we're doing business that makes sense for our customers and for us, and we'll continue to be very thoughtful there.\nSeth Basham: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning, guys.\nWill Stengel: Hey, Bret.\nBert Nappier: Hey, Bret.\nBret Jordan: A lot of it's been covered, but I guess ex the hurricanes, do you see any meaningful regional dispersion in U.S. NAPA?\nBert Nappier: We have -- we haven't seen any dispersion ex the hurricanes and then ex the M&A benefit, everybody was around the same level of performance, no material difference.\nBret Jordan: Okay. And then I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about either nearshoring or reshoring some of your supply chain. Could you give us a little more color on that? And is there a margin impact one way or the other?\nWill Stengel: Yes. Look, I think we had a great update with the Motion team a few weeks ago. We detailed this deeply and we've got a lot of great sales leads and traction for that matter around specific projects. I think on one of the calls, somebody asked us what that opportunity set is. And if you just look at the U.S. business by itself for Motion, we're tracking somewhere over 150 different projects between now and 2030, that represent about $2.5 billion of MRO spend for us. So, some small portion of that is a pretty attractive incremental headwind or a tailwind for us and we put some resources to it and seen some nice traction by vertical. That's what we refer to as our new sales verticals. So definitely, in focus. We see it in Canada, and we've got the same chart in Mexico, all with exciting opportunities.\nBret Jordan: Okay. Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Bret.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Bret.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. As always, I'd like to start by thanking our global teammates for their hard work serving our customers. And I'd also like to acknowledge all those who were negatively impacted by the devastating hurricanes in the U.S. I'm proud of our teams as they rally together to take care of each other and our customers. Our culture shines through with our teammates going above and beyond to navigate the challenge. Taking care of our communities is a pillar of our mission at GPC and we'll continue to support impacted communities through our partners at the American Red Cross. Let me also welcome Jenn Hulett to GPC. Jenn joined GPC in August as our new Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer, responsible for advancing the company's global talent and culture initiatives. This is a critical area of focus as we continuously strive to be an employer of choice. We look forward to Jenn's many contributions. Before I get into the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the business and share my perspective after nearly six months in the role as CEO. GPC has a great legacy. NAPA will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. Motion is a market-leading value-added industrial solutions business founded in 1946 and our international automotive businesses in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada have similar long proud histories. Together, GPC is a differentiated business with compelling opportunities individually and collectively as one GPC team in each of the global markets we serve. As we leverage the size, scale and strength of our company in our fragmented industries, we're intensely focused on evolving the business and leaning into the initiatives around talent and culture, technology, supply chain and sales effectiveness that we shared at our last Investor Day. Transformation and investment across all industries is critical as customers' needs and markets continue to evolve at increasing speeds. I'm confident that we're doing the right hard work for GPC's long-term benefit as we look to not only extend our existing competitive advantages, but also create new ones. Most importantly, our legacy has created financial strength, both in terms of our cash flow and our balance sheet to thoughtfully pursue these actions through business cycles. Our capital allocation discipline is elevated as we work to methodically balance foundational, growth and innovative investments across the most attractive and strategic GPC opportunities. In parallel, we're committed to growing our long-standing dividend. We acknowledge that these strategic investments come with near-term trade-offs, including higher costs that are amplified by sluggish market conditions and an underlying inflationary cost environment, in turn pressuring results as seen in the third quarter. We're balancing the medium and long-term by offsetting current headwinds with a back-to-basics customer and operational excellence mindset, which is gaining traction as evidenced by improved internal operating metrics. We're also managing core operating costs through global restructuring activities, which are on track to deliver the intended impact. And we continuously pursue initiatives to simplify the business and further enhance our productivity. As we close out 2024 and look ahead to 2025, I want to highlight select examples of actions that reinforce our enthusiasm for GPC's future. At Motion, we continue to extend our value proposition with our customers with tools, technology and expertise to drive embedded solutions that create value and efficiency for our customers. Further, our investments in automation to address customers' productivity needs and mobilizing our technical sales expertise to capitalize on reshoring and nearshoring activity present meaningful new opportunities for us. At our U.S. automotive business, we've invested in inventory to drive better availability by broadening our assortment, while simultaneously improving operational productivity. These investments, combined with actions to improve our delivery times from stores have strengthened our daily value proposition. The quality of the NAPA brand is differentiated and our longstanding local relationships, geographic footprint and expertise position us to continue to lead in the do-it-for-me segment. The recently announced refinement to the U.S. automotive operating model will drive greater commercial opportunities in key markets across the U.S., improving revenue growth and profitability over time. Underpinning these activities are critical investments in technology, that include automation of DCs with next generation robotics, enhancements to the customer digital experience, including better search and catalog capabilities and modernization of our store systems. These investments will position us to deliver a better customer experience and capture growth moving forward. We're also leveraging 250 world-class engineers at our global tech center in Krakow, Poland to build software for global initiatives, including innovative products with emerging technology. And finally, by leaning into our One GPC operating philosophy, we're unlocking the synergies that exist between our automotive and industrial businesses globally, with meaningful value creation opportunities ahead as we implement as an example, our reenergized approach to IT collaboration across the globe to simplify and harmonize our operations. In total, our initiatives are designed to create a better customer experience and generate growth in excess of the market, reduce costs and deliver attractive returns. All our efforts are at different levels of maturity, but all have exciting runway. Our operating cadence as a global leadership team is designed to challenge ourselves and each other, each day to be faster, smarter and better. The decisions to pursue long-term investment are difficult in the face of near-term market headwinds. But we believe, that these investments will increase the intrinsic value of GPC over time. Our financial results were obviously below our expectations in the third quarter, driven by various market factors that we expect to be temporary in nature. But we are confident that we're doing the right body of work to make the company better. Now turning to the third quarter. Note that our results include the impacts of two major hurricanes, Beryl and Helene and the start of the fourth quarter has been affected by Hurricane Milton. For the third quarter, total GPC sales were approximately $6 billion, an increase of 2.5% year-over-year due to the benefits of an extra selling day in the U.S. and acquisitions, particularly in U.S. automotive. However, continued softness in market conditions across our global geographies negatively impacted our sales growth in the quarter relative to our expectations, with the most pronounced impacts in Europe and our global industrial business. The weaker demand environment continues to be impacted by interest rates, combined with persistent cost inflation and election and geopolitical uncertainty. These factors are impacting our customers, most notably with tightened budgets and reduced spending for capital projects in our industrial business and reduced spending in general maintenance and discretionary categories across our automotive segment. The weak sales environment along with cost pressure in wages and rent expense plus anticipated headwinds from depreciation and interest expense resulted in adjusted earnings being down year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $1.88, down from $2.49 last year. Our results for the third quarter missed our expectations. Our outlook in July, included anticipated improvements in market conditions in Europe and global industrial activity, neither of which materialized. Our original expectation for the third quarter included flat industrial sales growth. Actual reported results ended up down low-single-digits. In Europe, we expected low-single-digit organic growth, actual results ended up flat. The combination of these market headwinds contributed to over $140 million in lower sales in the quarter versus our expectations. Given our results to-date and our expectation that these weaker market conditions will likely persist for the balance of the year, we've adjusted our 2024 outlook accordingly. While many of these factors are outside of our control, we remain focused on controlling what we can and we're confident in eventual market tailwinds. Bert will provide a clear explanation of the impact of hurricanes, variation drivers versus prior year and our third quarter expectations, as well as our updated outlook in his prepared comments shortly. Looking at our results by business segment. During the third quarter, total sales for Global Industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% versus the same period last year and comparable sales were down 2%. During the quarter, we had one extra selling day, compared to the third quarter of last year, which positively impacted total sales growth by approximately 140 basis points. Looking at the cadence for the quarter, average daily sales were down mid-single-digits in July, relatively flat in August and down mid-single-digits in September. Lagging industrial production activity continues to be the main headwind for our industrial business, as we're now in the longest period of contraction for PMI in over 33-years. While this period of contraction has lasted longer than many expected, history does show us that we typically see a long period of attractive growth once the index inflects into expansion territory. During the third quarter, three of our 14 end-markets we track showed positive average daily sales growth year-over-year. We saw relative strength coming from pulp and paper and our distribution and logistics segment, which was offset by weakness in equipment and machinery, lumber and wood and iron and steel. Within industrial, our core MRO business has remained relatively flat year-over-year with continued strength across corporate accounts through the year. However, customer spending related to capital projects, which represents approximately 20% of sales has been down mid-single-digits versus prior year. We continue to hear from customers considering capital projects that they are pausing, not canceling these plans until they have better visibility into the interest rate environment and the outcome of the election in the U.S. As the market leader, Motion is well positioned to capitalize on the eventual improvement in the manufacturing economy, near and long-term to expand our customer base and profitably grow share of wallet in this highly fragmented market. As a testament to Motion's value proposition and customer service, Motion has already received Supplier of the Year awards from six of its largest 25 customers in 2024, surpassing the total it received in the previous four years combined. Industrial segment profit in the third quarter was $259 million, down approximately 8% versus prior year and 11.9% of sales, representing an approximate 100 basis point decrease from the same period last year, driven by sales deleverage combined with wage inflation and higher depreciation expense. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the third quarter were $3.8 billion, an increase of approximately 5% with comparable store sales up slightly. During the quarter, we had one extra selling day in the U.S., compared to prior year, which positively impacted Global Automotive sales growth by approximately 90 basis points. Similar to the first half of the year, the Global Automotive sales benefit from inflation remained less than 1% in the third quarter and we expect the same in the fourth quarter. Global Automotive segment profit in the third quarter was $262 million, down approximately 19% versus prior year and 6.9% of sales, down from 8.9% of sales in the same period last year. Our third quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflect ongoing pressures from a soft sales environment and cost pressures, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Now let's turn to our Automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our team delivered total sales growth of approximately 6% in local currency with comparable sales flat. During the third quarter, overall market growth remained muted, down low-single-digits, which was consistent with the second quarter. The weak economic backdrop in Europe is being driven by an elevated level of deferred maintenance attributable to real wage declines, unemployment, higher interest rates and uncertain political and geopolitical situations. In addition, the benefit from same SKU inflation was less than 1%, while the prior year benefit was mid-single-digits. As we look at the economic backdrop in three key European markets; Germany, France and the U.K., higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumer purchasing power across these three geographies. Furthermore, higher unemployment rates and real wage declines in France and Germany have contributed to softer spending at the consumer level. Collectively, these factors are driving weak consumer confidence across the three markets. Despite this challenging environment, our team continues to outpace the market growth and win share, driven in part by our initiatives with key accounts and the rollout of the NAPA brand, which is a competitive differentiator. In the Asia Pac Automotive business, sales in the third quarter increased approximately 7% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 4%. Sales for both commercial and retail increased in the third quarter with continued strength in retail, particularly in Australia. The macro environment is also challenging in the region with Australia experiencing the weakest economic growth in nearly three decades and New Zealand currently is in its second recession in 18-months. However, our teams are executing well, extending our industry-leading position and taking market share. In Canada, sales increased 1% in local currency during the third quarter with comparable sales decreasing 1%. Our Canadian team continues to perform despite ongoing pressure from a more cautious consumer and difficult macro environment. Sales in automotive and heavy vehicle performed similar in -- during the quarter, with both having positive growth. Lastly, in the U.S., Automotive sales increased 4% during the third quarter with comparable sales essentially flat. The extra day versus the same quarter last year positively impacted sales growth by approximately 160 basis points. Our growth was also driven by acquisitions, most notably the acquisition of MPEC that we completed in May. The sales results were broadly in line with our expectations as we believe we're benefiting from the actions that we've detailed over the last few quarters to improve our execution, and we're seeing a positive impact in the marketplace. Our average daily sales cadence through the quarter was positive in all three months with July being the softest month. Sales to our commercial customers increased low-single-digits in the quarter while sales to do-it-yourself customers was down mid-single digits. Within Commercial, fleet and government, auto care and other wholesale were all positive, while major accounts underperformed the Group, but improved sequentially as we remain focused on profitable growth within the major account segment. On a comparable basis, sales from company-owned stores were slightly positive, while comparable sales into our independent stores were down slightly. More broadly for U.S. Automotive, to provide additional perspective on the cautious consumer, on a year-to-date basis, our non-discretionary repair categories, which accounts for approximately 50% of NAPA's business were up low to mid-single-digits. Our general maintenance categories, which represents approximately 35% of our business, were flat year-over-year, driven by continued cautious end-consumer, who is deferring certain service and maintenance-related purchases. Discretionary categories, representing approximately 15% of the business, were down mid-single-digits. We continue to invest in our U.S. Automotive business for growth and build on significant improvements in service over the past year. During the quarter, we further invested in inventory, increasing the SKU coverage in our company-owned stores by approximately 10%, while driving further productivity in our DCs, which resulted in a more than 8% increase in our internal DC service metrics. We're encouraged with the continued progress and have seen a material improvement in our customer service and store delivery metrics. We will obviously, continue to stay focused on this important effort. Going forward, we see the commercial customer as the growth engine of our industry and we benefit from the fact that 80% of NAPA's business serves this segment. Our continuous improvement on inventory availability, service and product quality position us well to win in the markets that we serve. Following our successful acquisition of the MPEC business in the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of our next largest owner, Walker Automotive Supply in August, furthering our plan to own more of our stores in strategic priority markets. We added approximately 70 NAPA stores across North Carolina. Year-to-date, we've made strategic acquisitions of more than 450 NAPA stores from our independent owners, as well as competitive stores in key markets, including approximately 160 in the third quarter. Our store network in the U.S. is now comprised of over 6,000 stores, of which approximately 35% are company-owned, up from approximately 25% at the end of 2022. Over time, we see a path to bring our network closer to a 50-50 mix with our independent owners continuing to play a critical role in our network. While our quarterly financial results were below our expectations, we are confident that we are investing in the right areas to better position GPC and we're experiencing traction across numerous efforts. We believe, the current market softness is temporary and will eventually serve as a tailwind. The long-term fundamentals of our industries are attractive and our businesses are well-established with leadership positions. We're balancing near-term actions and medium and long-term investments. Disciplined and consistent investment in our business, particularly during temporary periods of broad weaker industry dynamics will strengthen our leadership positions and earn profitable market share and create value. In closing, thank you again to our global teams for the leadership and hard work. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Kate, I might just add, as we look at all the internal operating metrics that we use to run the business, in particular in NAPA, we continue to be very bullish about the progress that we've made. So whether it's service levels from deliveries to stores, from DCs, from stores to customers, those are at all-time highs and getting better every day. As Bert said, the inventory strategy was all about making sure that we had the right vendor alignment with the right availability in the local markets and those have seen material improvement year-over-year. Safety is better in our DCs, inventory breadth and depth, as Bert alluded to, has never been better. So we've added deeper and wider inventory while using our existing supply chain. Voluntary turnover is down 30% plus year-over-year. And importantly, we're seeing about 100 basis point improvement in our customer metrics in terms of their satisfaction. So as we're running the business and putting these investments in, we feel good about the returns that are associated with them. Scott, I might just add in the same way that we've articulated the higher interest rates have had the intended effect muting and slowing down overall growth, we are encouraged, obviously by the start of an easing scenario around the world. The U.K. has reduced rates once in the last, call it, six months, U.S. once, Eurozone 3 times, Canada 3 times. So obviously, there'll be a lag benefit to that, but we would hope as we move forward, those types of policy decisions provide a tailwind as opposed to a headwind. Yes. Look, Michael, I think it's super important for any business to be investing in itself. And so I think as the management team organized their strategic plan, in particular, dating back to our Investor Day in 2023, we had a lot of compelling opportunities to invest back in the business in a different way, which I think is a function of the market realities, the changing technology landscape, the competitive dynamic. And so all those things put together set the stage for putting capital to work around the world in an accelerated way. Chris, I would say the election is a clearing event with a lag. So by the time you turn the calendar year, the election flips and there's at least kind of clarity on the margin relative to where we stand today, especially with the backdrop of lower rates. And I think that helps. And look, Chris, we don't give quarterly guidance. So the quarter comps we haven't provided. But I would just say, I'd go back to my thoughts in the prepared remarks, we really don't expect the fourth quarter thematically to look much different than the third quarter in terms of the underlying performance of the business given the market conditions. No, we feel really good about it. And we use on the NAPA side a third-party independent data that's got everybody's information in it and it's never been stronger, always opportunities. There's 120 categories that you have to look at to study SKU level share and we've made incredible progress there. So -- and then on the industrial side, we're right there or better than the market. There's some data points out there from peers and obviously, the PMI. So down a little bit in this market is at or better than market performance. Thanks, Melich. I think the markets got worse and the hurricane impacts put noise into the data. So a flattish market feels about right to us, a plus or minus a point. Yes. So we were really pleased with the sequential improvement in major accounts. As I think, we've talked about publicly before, inside our major accounts, we have four or five different books of business and each have their own specific initiatives. And those initiatives are gaining traction, specifically around some of our priorities in our regional quote, unquote major accounts and our independent affiliates. So we're focused intentionally there to make sure that, we're doing business that makes sense for our customers and for us, and we'll continue to be very thoughtful there. Hey, Bret. Yes. Look, I think we had a great update with the Motion team a few weeks ago. We detailed this deeply and we've got a lot of great sales leads and traction for that matter around specific projects. I think on one of the calls, somebody asked us what that opportunity set is. And if you just look at the U.S. business by itself for Motion, we're tracking somewhere over 150 different projects between now and 2030, that represent about $2.5 billion of MRO spend for us. So, some small portion of that is a pretty attractive incremental headwind or a tailwind for us and we put some resources to it and seen some nice traction by vertical. That's what we refer to as our new sales verticals. So definitely, in focus. We see it in Canada, and we've got the same chart in Mexico, all with exciting opportunities. Thanks, Bret."

            "content": "Thanks, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. Our results for the quarter reflect the impact of several factors; weak market conditions, the cost impact of investments we are making in the business and disruptions from the CrowdStrike outage in July and two major hurricanes. The third quarter was challenging and in evaluating our financial results and to provide additional transparency, we reflected on three key themes, which I will address, along with an update on our cash flows and capital allocation. Those themes are, what drove our profitability down year-over-year, how did the quarter differ from our expectations and what is our outlook for the remainder of 2024. My comments this morning will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the non-recurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program and costs related to the acquisition of MPEC and Walker. During the third quarter, we incurred a total of $45 million of pretax costs or $36 million after-tax related to the restructuring efforts and integration activities. Before I review our three key themes in detail, let me share some high level context for our results, starting with sales. Total sales were up 2.5% in the third quarter, which included a benefit from acquisitions of 320 basis points and the benefit of an additional selling day in the U.S. totaling 110 basis points. Sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by disruptions from Hurricanes Helene and Beryl, as well as the CrowdStrike outage, totaling approximately 70 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin was 36.8%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. The improvement in our gross margin was driven by acquisitions, primarily at U.S. Automotive, which drove approximately 60 basis points of gross margin expansion. Turning to cost, our SG&A as a percentage of sales for the third quarter was 28.8%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. The impact of acquired businesses, investments in IT and cost pressures contributed to the year-over-year deleverage. More specifically, our MPEC and Walker acquisitions negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 50 basis points. The incremental SG&A from acquired businesses will abate over time as we execute on our integration plans and capture synergies. We are now five months and two months post close of our MPEC and Walker transactions respectively, and expect each respective integration to take approximately 24 months from start to finish. Our integration efforts are on track with respect to timing and synergy capture. Both acquisitions contributed positively to our EBITDA margin in the third quarter. Inflation-driven increases in rent expense and salaries and wages, including increased minimum wages in certain international markets, along with service improvement investments in freight expense resulted in approximately 120 basis points of SG&A deleverage versus the prior year. In addition, our planned investments in technology to modernize our business resulted in a 20 basis points headwind in SG&A in the third quarter. Our global restructuring initiative remains on track. Our restructuring efforts are a key element of our work to offset the headwinds of current market conditions and cost inflation across the business. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $160 million of costs related to our restructuring efforts, in-line with the top end of our range of $100 million to $200 million of costs. During the third quarter, we realized approximately $16 million in benefits from our restructuring efforts and expect to deliver a benefit of between $30 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis, in-line with our expectations. With that context, let's turn to the first theme. Our third quarter profitability. Our third quarter results were down year-over-year from an adjusted EPS of $2.49 to an adjusted EPS of $1.88, a decline of $0.61. As we look at the details, I will describe the major drivers of our year-over-year decline in terms of impact to EPS, and you can see these illustrated in our earnings presentation. First, as we expected, higher depreciation and interest expense, combined with IT costs I referenced in my SG&A comments drove approximately $0.25 of the year-over-year decline in earnings. Our initiatives come with cost headwinds, which we anticipated and planned for in 2024. These costs are in the form of higher depreciation expense as we depreciate new investments, higher SG&A as our efforts to modernize IT show up in operating expense and higher interest expense from borrowings to fund investments, particularly in this higher interest rate environment. As I mentioned, core cost inflation is negatively impacting salaries and wages along with rent expense and we are making investments to improve service that are contributing to higher freight expense. For the quarter, these higher costs combined with deleverage on lower sales reduced our year-over-year earnings by an estimated $0.38. These negative impacts were partially offset by benefits of our global restructuring actions totaling $0.08. Finally, the quarter was negatively impacted by lost revenues as a result of the impacts of disruptions from the hurricanes and the CrowdStrike outage, which translated into an estimated $0.06 reduction in earnings for the quarter. With respect to Hurricane Helene, we closed September with approximately 200 locations across NAPA and Motion impacted by power outages and storm damage. Many of these locations have come back online, but we continue to operate with closed stores and disrupted customers. With respect to the second theme related to our expectations, we underperformed, where we expected to be in the third quarter. As we shared in our second quarter earnings call, we expected weak market conditions and headwinds from depreciation, IT investments and interest to result in lower third quarter earnings, and we were targeting an adjusted EPS range of $2.20 to $2.25. Our adjusted results for the quarter with EPS of $1.88 came in below our expectations, driven by two key factors, weaker results in Europe and our industrial business and the impact of CrowdStrike and the hurricanes. When we gave guidance in July, our outlook assumes sequential improvement in market conditions in the second-half of 2024, and tailwinds from easing comparisons. More specifically, our original expectations for the third quarter included industrial sales growth coming in flat and low-single-digit organic European growth. Underlying European market conditions did not inflect in the quarter and remain negative on a sequential basis from the second quarter. For industrial, PMI closed June at 48.5%, nearly flat to May and then turned sharply negative in July at 46.8%, rebounding slightly to 47.2% in both August and September. Along with negative industrial production manufacturer readings in September, this backdrop resulted in our sales for industrial in the third quarter being down. As Will shared, the underperformance of our European and industrial businesses versus our expectations translated into $140 million in reduced sales or an estimated $0.30 of earnings. When combined with a $0.06 impact from CrowdStrike and the hurricanes, this led to an approximate $0.36 earnings shortfall versus our expectations. Our third quarter performance, which was largely driven by ongoing weak market conditions, led us to the third theme, our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Based on the trends we are seeing in our business, including our lower-than-expected third quarter performance, we are adjusting our 2024 outlook. With no sequential improvement in market conditions in the third quarter from the second quarter, our revised outlook reflects our view that the demand environment for the balance of the year will remain consistent with the third quarter. We now expect that diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $6.60 to $6.80, compared to our previous outlook of $8.55 to $8.75. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $8 to $8.20. This compares to our previous outlook of a range of $9.30 to $9.50. Our earnings presentation includes an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our revised outlook for 2024. Let me take a moment and walk you through the details of these components, starting with sales. We now expect total sales growth in a range of up 1% to 2% versus our previous outlook of up 1% to 3%, which includes the benefit of acquisitions we've made year-to-date. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following. 3% to 4% total sales growth for the automotive segment, which includes the benefit of acquisitions made year-to-date. We anticipate comparable sales growth to be approximately flat. And for the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth to be down 1% to 2% with comparable sales growth also down 1% to 2%. Our reduced sales outlook for the year is driven by updated expectations around market conditions. For the balance of 2024, we do not expect any improvement in market conditions across our geographies. Our expectations are informed by third-party data, as well as the trends we experienced in the third quarter, which have persisted into the start of the fourth quarter. Further, the beginning of the quarter has been compounded by the impacts of hurricane Milton across Florida as well as the continuing effects of Hurricane Helene. While we've made good progress on restoring our operations, uncertainty remains around our customers and their ability to resume operations, which makes the ultimate impact on our business difficult to predict. Our updated guidance includes our estimated impact of these storms on our results for the remainder of the year. Within industrial, the weak industrial production activity remains a headwind for the business. As Will mentioned, we are now in the longest period of contraction for PMI in over 33-years. We now believe that improvement won't come in 2024 as we wait for PMI to inflect into expansionary territory and for the benefit of initial interest rate cuts to have a positive impact on our customers. In our International and U.S. Automotive businesses, market conditions continue to remain soft as consumers are impacted by a wide range of factors, including inflation, interest rates and geopolitical election uncertainty. In the U.S., while our independent owners continue to gain strength, high interest rates remain a headwind for these small and medium business owners. For gross margin, we continue to expect 40 basis points to 60 basis points of full year gross margin expansion, primarily driven by the acquisitions in U.S. Automotive and our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 140 basis points and 150 basis points, which includes SG&A deleverage on our reduced sales outlook, ongoing cost inflation and the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the U.S. Automotive business. Our views include the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For Global Automotive segment margin, we now expect to be down approximately 90 basis points to 100 basis points versus last year, given the softer organic sales growth and corresponding pressure on SG&A. For 2024, we expect Global Industrial segment margin to be down approximately 40 basis points to 50 basis points year-over-year. For the first nine months of 2024, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and $700 million in free cash flow. We are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. Delivering consistent cash flows in all business cycles, combined with our liquidity, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation philosophy positions us to grow the business long-term. In 2024, we have invested approximately $386 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $126 million in the third quarter. With respect to capital expenditures, as we shared at our Investor Day in 2023, our historical investment rate in our business hovered at around 1% or less of revenue. Over the past two years to drive the needed transformation of our business, this has moved to 2% of our revenue and we continue to expect an investment rate of 2% of revenue or approximately $500 million in spending in 2024. The growth capital we are deploying, which represents approximately 55% of our total 2024 CapEx will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs and automation, that when partnered with technology enhances our customer experience and positions us for long term growth. Further, disciplined M&A has been a key element of our growth as we take advantage of value creation opportunities in our fragmented markets globally. In 2024, our M&A strategy has evolved with respect to our operating model at NAPA and our new approach to having a more balanced mix of company owned and independently owned stores will improve our revenue growth and profitability over the long-term. We have invested $954 million globally year-to-date in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our now largest independent owner, Walker Automotive Supply. As we acquire these businesses, we have a disciplined integration playbook where we extract value through incremental sales opportunities, capture the full gross margin and optimize the SG&A of the acquired business. During the third quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by initiating the transition of our U.S. pension plan to a third-party insurance company, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025. This is a continuation of our pension de-risking strategy that began in 2013, when the plan was frozen and does not impact the benefits of the planned participants. Our pension plan is well funded and we took this step to reduce balance sheet and income statement volatility and protect us from future potential cash flow contributions. We anticipate a one-time non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2025 and do not expect any impact to our 2024 financial results. Further, we do not expect any cash payments associated with the transfer of the plan to the third party insurance company in 2025. In closing, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions including advancing our global restructuring activities to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. We believe, the backdrop of lower growth is market driven, not specific to our business, and we stand well positioned for growth once the cycle turns more favorable. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the recent reduction in interest rates in the U.S. and are optimistic that lower rates will create a more constructive market backdrop moving forward. Although, we recognize that this will take time to result in improved activity. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and we'll continue to invest in the business with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Sure, Kate. Good morning. Look, on the inventory side, I think that goes back to really some of what Will touched on and positioning us in the marketplace on the NAPA side. We've made some great strides on getting inventory availability, where it needs to be. That's a year-over-year kind of effort. We started that this time last year, as you recall. And I think we've really made some nice moves to increase depth, increase SKU count and do the things that matter in the field. We know that inventory availability is the deciding factor in being successful, NAPA's great legacy, it's got a great brand, it's got a great footprint. And so when we put that inventory power behind it, I think it really positions us well in the marketplace. That's the biggest driver of the change there. We also have some acquired inventory from the acquisitions we've made. So that will show up in the balance sheet as well. In terms of investments at freight, some of those are a bit competitively sensitive. I would just leave it at the fact that we're really leaning into making sure that, we've got on the other side of the equation, that store excellence, making sure, we have the driver availability and consistency of experience that we want to make sure, we're meeting the needs of our customers. Thanks, Kate. Hey, Scot, it's Bert. Look, on the margin side for U.S. Automotive, we don't really get into the details by the individual regions. I will say that the pressure we felt at the consolidated level was consistent across all the markets. And so, we were disappointed in total with where we were. It came in underneath our expectations as we've outlined. But I wouldn't isolate the pressure in any one market regionally around the world versus the other. They're all feeling the same kind of pressure. Interest rate pressure in all of our markets on the automotive side, cost inflation are both present in all of those markets. And so, when we think about the factors that drove SG&A, that I outlined in my prepared comments, those would be true for each of the regions individually. In terms of how we're looking ahead, and as you said, we don't want to get too specific. But look, I mean, I think the bottom line on 2025, is that we're going to continue to watch all the same data that you all are. And at this point, as we exit the third quarter and start the fourth quarter and start to look into 2025, those conditions remain pretty stagnant quarter-over-quarter. And so, market conditions are going to be a big factor in how we look at things. The bottom line though, is we're very encouraged by the long-term fundamentals for both segments. And we're in great fixed industries. I think those are beneficial to us in the long-term. Our size and scale is a benefit there as well. We have leadership positions in fragmented markets around the globe, and we're bullish on the execution of our strategic initiatives as Will outlined. But the biggest wildcard moving ahead with that positive backdrop is the pace and timing of recovery of market conditions. And so we'll take the fourth quarter to see what we think the market will give us for next year, plus our own actions and the things that we think we're going to be able to do and we'll update that and share that with you in February. Yes. Thank you. Hey, Michael, good morning. Look, a big part of the dollar increase in SG&A is going to come from acquired businesses. So I think that's an isolated activity, particularly here as you look in the second half of 2024 with the acquisition of our two largest independent owners on the NAPA side of the house. So I kind of outlined that and detailed that in my prepared remarks. On that particular point, we would expect that SG&A to abate over time as we continue to integrate those businesses and capture synergies. The great news is we're on track on that front. We're seeing our synergy capture come in consistent with our business case. And as I shared, both of those acquisitions contributed positively to our third quarter. As we look ahead on some of those other elements, I think we'll continue to see pressure here in the near-term on the cost side of things with inflationary impacts on wages and rent. I don't expect those to abate in the fourth quarter. And likewise, we're going to continue to invest in IT, that's an important part of our transformation going forward. And there's some positive things there. Unfortunately, as we modernize systems, many of those are cloud-based platforms that transition expense out of capital into operating expense, which is why we're highlighting that for you. But we're also making some great investments in the business, in particular with our Global Technology center in Poland. We benefit from exceptional talent, high productivity and these teams are doing amazing work on some of our initiatives around catalog and search, which is clearly making a difference with our customers. So when we think about investment, that's an example of a thing I think you'll continue to see. But at the same time, we're also trying to be very thoughtful about offsetting some of this with our global restructuring, which remains on track. We saw a benefit in the quarter as we've discussed, and we're continuing to control headcount. The restructuring is helping with that. Most of that has come from voluntary retirements in the U.S. But if we look at our global headcount, we're down somewhere between 3% and 5% in 2024, excluding acquisitions. And we're continuing to do hard work across the network with engineering standards and engineering productivity and RDCs that's reducing over time and allowing us to be more thoughtful about headcount there as well. And Michael, I'll just add that I believe, that if you looked prior to Investor Day in 2023, you would have seen the GPC business in totality spending about 1% of revenue in terms of investment in the business. And so that's across all of our business segments. And that quite frankly, I think is not the level of investment we needed to stay at pace and grow this business and keep it on its front foot going forward. We think the technology work that we're doing and leading with technology is going to be a differentiator. And we think investing in our supply chains, which will make a difference for our customers, and as we know, having that part and having it at the right place and the right time, both on the Automotive and the Industrial side is critical to being successful. And as we make these enhancements across DCs, which we've mentioned, we're doing that in the U.K. and France, here in the U.S., we have a new DC in Melbourne, we're doing this all over the world. And you combine that with the technology, I think that's going to position us for a much stronger growth, particularly as we come out of this weaker economic cycle. Thanks, Michael. Yes. Chris, we haven't changed our view on investment level on CapEx for 2024. We're still going to come in right around that 2% level. And as I commented in my prepared remarks, that's going to be around $500 million of investment. So there's no step up on the CapEx side of the house. We really think the 2% number is the right proxy. We did that last year. We'll do that again this year and we'll be thoughtful about how we look ahead to 2025. In terms of run rate on acquisition, I think, I would tell you that we expect that to -- that was never going to be linear. I think it's the best way to say it when you think about the independent owner strategy. As you've seen this year, we've acquired the two largest. And from there, acquiring 180 plus stores in May, as we've announced with Walker 75 stores, the next levels of independent owners drop pretty significantly in terms of store count size. And so I think you'll see, while we continue to march to maybe a more 50-50 target, the pace and timing of that will slow. So I think we get the first two big ones, which were important to do in the Q first and then we'll move at pace, but the pace will decelerate from what you've seen here over the last two quarters. Not for the fourth quarter. I would say, the lag is coming into 2025. I don't think the election clarity in November, creates a business impact immediately in November and December. No, I wouldn't take it that way, Chris. I mean, I think we're trying to give you a reasonable proxy of what we felt like the sales loss was. I mean, given the gross margin rate impact of that and the lost sales in the quarter. So I wouldn't overread into that in terms of operating margin. I think this year is a tough year to use as a proxy, Greg, is my kind of initial response to that. We've had a lot of moving pieces. Market conditions have moved backwards. I think as you look historically, we've said that the growth algorithm is in that 3% to 4% top line range in the long, long term for the business in terms of top line and that we can lever off of that. This year with market conditions, particularly on the industrial side moving negative, it's not a year I would use as a proxy. So I don't think we're ready to move off of what we think are long-term algorithms, but obviously, we reserve the right to kind of update you as we get into 2025 and the 2025 guidance, particularly as we see with what the fourth quarter presents and how we think the beginning of 2025 will start. So let's not deviate from how we think about the health of this business on a long-term basis, as Will has said, I think we're very bullish on what the long-term can be and the investments we're making in the business. Those have stepped up from a 1% historical rate, but that 2% is the same level of investment we shared with you at Investor Day. So we think that does set a little bit of a new proxy there. But again, we'll come back to you with some more thoughtful outlook when we get to February. Look, again, I'll always reserve my right to update you when we build our models for 2025 and share those in February. But I think we're coming out of the period that we all expected. We saw this start last year in 2023 in the U.S., and we're seeing it now in Europe. We expected those high benefits of inflation in the top line to cool off, and they have. We're going through what I think is the unwinding of all that now. And again, if I go back to the first question about the long-term, if you think the long-term is a 3% to 4%, embedded in that long-term is a 0.5% to 1% range of price benefit. And we would expect in the long-term, absent something else coming to light that changes our view on the health of the markets fundamentally, that would be the case and we would vert to something more normalized as we move ahead. And on the second part of that Seth, on the competitive set, I mean, I wouldn't say that the competitive sets changed much. We have great competitors. We compete day-to-day with a competitive landscape that, thankfully remains very rational on pricing. And so we're encouraged by NAPA's position in the market as I said earlier, with its great footprint, legacy availability and quality. Hey, Bret. We have -- we haven't seen any dispersion ex the hurricanes and then ex the M&A benefit, everybody was around the same level of performance, no material difference. Thanks, Bret."

With that, let me turn the call over to Will.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before we turn to the results of the quarter, I'd like to share a few thoughts as part of my transition into the CEO role over the last 45 days. First and foremost, it's an honor and a privilege to serve as only the sixth CEO in Genuine Parts Company\u2019s nearly 100-year history. GPC has a special culture which was founded on taking care of our people and offering solutions to our customers efficiently and consistently. This has served our business incredibly well over the years and will remain a core element of our foundation. As part of the transition over the last several months, I've spent time engaging with our teammates, customers, and suppliers around the world. I'll share a few key messages that have come out of those discussions and that are areas of emphasis as we move forward. First, leverage our culture as an advantage. We have a unique and differentiated culture. Our global engagement data shows the vast majority of our employees are incredibly proud to work for GPC. That's a fact of which we are proud and is a testament to our strong, consistent leadership over the years. We must nurture our culture to extend our unique advantage, but we must also continuously evolve with our customers and our markets. Second, build high-performing teams. Our talent strategies have been intentional as we continuously work to be an employer of choice. We have a capable group of leaders around the world that have aligned values and a clear understanding of our shared vision. But we amplify our impact when we relentlessly build high-performing teams throughout the organization, who are energized to work together, solve problems, and deliver results. Third, capture our exciting opportunities. We streamline GPC to focus on two core businesses with market-leading positions and significant exciting opportunities. We believe size and scale creates an advantage, and when we work together as we invest in capabilities and share best practices to solve common challenges, we act faster, we're more efficient, and we create value. Fourth, focus and execute our defined plans. We believe we have the right strategies and initiatives in place. We've worked together over the last three to four years as a global organization to understand our opportunities and prioritize the work that we're doing. We align globally around five key priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology, complemented by a disciplined acquisition strategy. This focused approach is not changing. We're intentional, we're disciplined, and we're leveraging expertise around the world to reduce complexity, improve the customer experience, deliver profitable growth, and increase productivity. And lastly, play to win and continuously improve. Thanks to the hard work of our teammates, we've made great progress as a company over recent years. But we're focused on continuous sequential improvement to build on our momentum. We can't be satisfied with good, instead striving to be great, always working to be better and faster in all that we do. Overall, it's fair to say I'm more energized than ever about the opportunities we have as a company and the future for Genuine Parts Company. I want to thank each of our over 60,000 global GPC teammates for their ongoing passion for serving our customers. In addition to serving our customers every day, our teams are executing and delivering on a broad set of initiatives while navigating a dynamic and challenging macro environment. Thank you to all, as always, for your good hard work. Now, let's turn to the specifics of our quarterly results. A few highlights for the second quarter include total GPC sales of $6 billion, which increased approximately 1% versus the same period in the prior year and included a tough start to the quarter with particularly weak sales month in April across both segments. Total company gross margin increased 50 basis points with continued execution of strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. And in May, we announced the acquisition of Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation, our largest NAPA independent owner in the US with a network of 181 locations across Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It's a great example of our ongoing initiative to own more NAPA stores in priority markets. Our second quarter results were below our expectations. The variance can be attributed to three key themes. Weaker than anticipated customer demand in industrial, accelerated softness in Europe, and choppy demand in the automotive aftermarket in the US. Many factors outside of our control, including higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and persistent inflation are driving overall weaker customer demand. This weaker demand environment and ongoing cost inflation resulted in adjusted earnings flat year-over-year for the quarter, which Burt will cover in more detail shortly. Looking at our results by business segment. During the second quarter, total sales for global industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% versus the same period last year, and comparable sales were down 1.6%. When we look at the sales performance for our industrial business, the main headwind remains lagging industrial production activity. Over the past 20 months, manufacturing PMI readings continue to be in the longest period of contraction since the financial crisis in 2009, as represented by a PMI index below 50. While we saw a positive reading in March, during the second quarter, the monthly PMI readings reverted back into contraction territory versus our cautiously optimistic expectation of an improving backdrop coming out of the first quarter. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were softer in April and relatively flat in May and June. In addition, the higher interest rate environment and election uncertainty is curbing larger capital spending decisions across our diversified customer base as they remain cautious. Looking at Motion's results across its end market served, we're still seeing mixed performance across the board. Five of our 14 end markets showed positive growth during the second quarter, which was in line with the first quarter, with relative strength coming from mining and chemicals, offset by weakness in equipment and machinery, fabricated metals, and aggregates and cement. Despite the market softness, Motion's corporate account customer base, which represents approximately 45% of the business, continues to perform well and is showing positive growth, which is a true testament to Motion's strong value proposition. Additionally, during the second quarter, the Motion team successfully renewed several key multi-year corporate account agreements and remains active with various well-defined field sales initiatives. Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $277 million, down approximately 2% versus prior year and 12.4% of sales, representing an approximate 10 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our business in North America performed well despite the softer sales performance, but was offset by pressure from our business in Australasia, given the challenging local economic environment and cost pressures. Turning to the global automotive segment, sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of 2%, with comparable store sales decreasing 0.6%. During the quarter, all of our automotive geographies showed positive sales growth in local currency. Similar to the first quarter, the global automotive sales benefit from inflation remained less than 1% in the second quarter, and we expect the same in the back half of the year. Global automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $314 million, down 4.7% versus prior year and 8.4% of sales, representing a 60 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our second quarter results for the global automotive segment reflect pressures from a challenging sales environment across our geographies, combined with inflation driving higher costs and outpacing sales growth. Now, let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our team delivered total sales growth of approximately 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We've seen a broadening in the moderation in demand across our geographies in Europe through the quarter. We believe this is driven by an incrementally more cautious consumer, as well as a reduced sales benefit from inflation, which is also now less than 1%. Despite this, our teams are focused on serving our customers, delivering on our strategic initiatives and delivering above-market performance. We're winning share with target key accounts and the NAPA brand expansion continues to be a differentiator. For 2024, we're on track to deliver sales of NAPA branded products in excess of EUR500 million, above our initial internal target. Our ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity also continues to have a positive impact and create value in Europe. In the AsiaPac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 3% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 2%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to a high single-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail increased in the second quarter, with retail showing relative strength. The macro environment remains challenging in the region but the teams are executing well to grow in excess of market and take advantage of their industry leading position. In Canada, sales increased 1% in local currency during the second quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 2%. Our Canadian team showed sequential improvement from the first quarter despite ongoing pressure from a more cautious consumer and difficult macro environment. Sales in automotive and heavy vehicle performed similarly during the quarter with both having slightly positive growth. In the US, automotive sales increased 0.5% during the second quarter, with comparable sales decreasing 1.5%. This represents a slight improvement in our reported results sequentially from the first quarter and was generally in line with our expectations. As we looked at our sales cadence through the quarter, average daily sales growth was pressured in April and then showed solid sequential improvement throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our overall results also benefited from our MPEC acquisition in May. From a customer segment perspective, sales to our commercial and do-it-yourself customers were both slightly down during the quarter with commercial outpacing do-it-yourself. For commercial, fleet and government, auto care, and other wholesale were all essentially in line, while major accounts underperformed the group, driven by continued cautious end consumer, as we\u2019re seeing elevated levels of deferrals from customers on certain repairs. For sales into our independent store owners, we saw another quarter of more normalized buying behavior, which is a trend we believe will continue throughout the balance of the year. We have active initiatives across our US automotive business and we're encouraged by the progress in the improvements that they're delivering. During the second quarter we saw further improvements in inventory fill rates and stocking levels for specific categories where we had opportunity. Additionally, the team continues to elevate the execution in our stores and DCs, which is driving better customer service metrics. We're pleased with these results, but we're intensely focused on continuous sequential improvement. And finally, we're making good progress on our initiative to evolve our operating model at US automotive to own more stores in selected priority markets. Our recent acquisitions of independent stores are being integrated into the NAPA network with a focus on improved performance and synergy capture. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operational excellence in both company owned and independently owned stores. During the second quarter we acquired 242 NAPA stores from our independent owners as well as competitive stores and key markets. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We'll continue to make methodical progress with our strategy of owning more stores in the second half of the year as the pipeline remains active, although we don't expect the recent acquisition pace to be linear through the year. With all these evolving factors in mind, we moderated our 2024 outlook for sales and earnings per share. We believe it's prudent to adjust our expectations for the second half of the year based on the current information available to us, particularly as it pertains to the industrial and European market outlook. And Bert will provide further color in a moment. While our quarterly results reflect a softer economic backdrop than we anticipated, our in-flight initiatives and fundamental prospects for our business remain robust. Within automotive, industry fundamentals like miles driven, the age of the car park, and new and used vehicle prices remain supportive. We benefit from the fact that NAPA's core business serves the commercial customer where many repairs are non-discretionary and break fix in nature. We like this position as we view the commercial customer as the growth engine of the industry given the increasingly complex vehicle fleet. Within industrial, our business is well diversified across 14 and growing different end markets that cover a wide range of the manufacturing economy, and we\u2019re positioned well to take advantage when economic conditions improved. Studying PMI cycles over time, we see a pattern of long periods of attractive growth once the index inflects into an expansion territory. Motion's highly technical sales expertise and solutions-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep their operations functioning effectively every day and in every market cycle. As the market leader, we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on the eventual improvement in the manufacturing economy, near and long term, as we expand our customer base and grow share of wallet in this fragmented market. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Bert, on behalf of the entire company, it's only fitting that I take a moment and extend our gratitude to Paul Donahue, not only for his tenure as CEO, but for his many contributions to Genuine Parts Company over his 20-year career. Under Paul's leadership as CEO, the company strategically evolved and transformed for the better. A few highlight accomplishments under Paul's leadership. He simplified the GPC business mix to enable strategic focus on our automotive and industrial segments. He championed the expansion of GPC around the world, growing our global footprint from six countries in 2016 to 17 countries in 2024, including the transformational acquisition of AAG in Europe. He led us through a pandemic and kept our team safe. He kept our culture thriving and he kept our teams operating to ensure we took care of our customers. He accelerated strategic investments of over $2 billion in growth capital, including the transformational acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group to extend our industrial leadership position, and obviously many other accomplishments. Altogether since 2016, GPC has grown its sales from $15 billion to approximately $24 billion. It goes without saying that Paul's positive impact on GPC has been remarkable. His ability to lead our teammates around the world has been inspiring and he's a tremendous steward of our GPC culture, importantly a good friend to all, and we certainly look forward to his continued counsel and his role as Executive Chairman. Thank you again to the entire GPC team around the world, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results were below our expectations, as market conditions, including lagging industrial production and weaker demand in our US automotives and European businesses negatively impacted our performance. Despite the muted market backdrop, our teams continue to operate with discipline and are making progress on priority strategic investments necessary for the business. The softer market conditions combined with the impact of inflation and acquired businesses on SG&A resulted in flat adjusted earnings year-over-year. With that context, let me take a few moments to comment on more specific details of the quarter along with our updated view on our outlook for the year. My comments this morning will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the non-recurring cost related to our previously announced global restructuring program and transaction costs related to the acquisition of MPEC. During the second quarter, we incurred a total of $62 million of costs on a pre-tax basis or $46 million after tax related to restructuring efforts and MPEC integration costs. As we look at the second quarter, total sales were up 0.8% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2.2% contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales and a 0.5% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our automotive and industrial segments, in line with our expectations. For the quarter, our gross margin expanded by 50 basis points from last year, driven in part by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to deliver positive results in our gross margin performance. In addition, the acquisitions we are making in our US automotive business contributed approximately 30 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 29.2% of sales in the second quarter, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. As we look at our expenses for the second quarter, we had a mix of factors, including the following. A negative impact of 50 basis points from increased salaries and wages associated with the acquisitions in US automotive and Europe, particularly from our recent MPEC acquisition. Salaries and wages costs continue to be negatively impacted by mandatory increases in minimum wages in our international businesses. Further, inflationary cost pressure and renewals of leased facilities and acquisitions drove a negative impact of approximately 30 basis points in rent expense. We experienced a negative impact of approximately 10 basis points from our ongoing investments in technology to modernize our business. Interest expense continues to be a headwind in 2024, driving a negative impact of approximately 10 basis points in our expenses. These items are partially upset by cost savings resulting from our global restructuring program of approximately 10 basis points. We expect the incremental SG&A from acquired businesses to abate over time as we execute on our integration plans and capture synergies. As a reminder, we are just 60 days post-close of our MPEC transaction with an integration that is expected to last approximately 24 months. For the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in segment profit and segment margin was primarily driven by the softer sales growth environment and associated deleverage on costs. Our second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes non-recurring expenses of $46 million after tax or $0.33 per diluted share, was $342 million or $2.44 per diluted share, in line with the same period of the prior year. Of the $62 million of non-recurring expense in the second quarter, approximately $37 million was related to our global restructuring program, and the remaining $25 million was related to the MPEC transaction. Our MPEC transaction costs primarily include impairments of leases and leasehold improvements for facilities we will not use as we integrate the business and capture synergies moving forward. Turning to our cash flows. For the first six months of 2024, we generated $612 million in cash from operations, up 34% year-over-year, and $353 million in free cash flow, which was up 40% from the prior year. Our strong cash flow in the first half of 2024 reflects a long-standing hallmark of GPC, which is delivering robust cash flows through low growth cycles. We closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. In 2024, we have invested approximately $260 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $143 million in the second quarter. In addition, we have invested $580 million here today in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our largest independent owner, MPEC. With this acquisition, we converted 181 independently owned stores in the Midwest to company owned, bringing our total company owned store count to nearly 30% of our US stores. We expect the acquisition to be accretive both before and after we realize synergies as we capture more commercial opportunities, gross margin, and optimize the SG&A of the acquired business. Our global restructuring initiative to better align our cost structure and assets with the current environment remains on track. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $120 million of costs related to our restructuring efforts, in line with our range of $100 million to $200 million. During the second quarter, we realized approximately $10 million of benefit from our restructuring and expect to deliver a benefit of between $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis, in line with our expectations. Our restructuring efforts are a key element of our work to offset the headwinds of current market conditions and cost inflation across the business. Turning to our outlook, we've updated our views on the remainder of 2024 based on our perspective on current market conditions across the business, most notably for our industrial, European, and US automotive businesses. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $8.55 to $8.75 compared to our previous outlook of $9.05 to $9.20. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50, up slightly to 2023 at the midpoint of the range. This compares to our previous outlook range of $9.80 to $9.95. Our wider range is reflective of the current macro environment, which has elevated the degree of uncertainty from earlier in 2024, particularly on the trends on the industrial side of the business. Our earnings presentation includes an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our revised outlook for 2024. Let me take a moment and walk through the details of these components, starting with sales. We now expect total sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, down from our previous outlook of 3% to 5%. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels, contributing less than 1% for both business segments. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following. 1% to 3% total sales growth for the automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. And for the industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of flat to 2% with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. Our reduced sales outlook for the year is driven by our updated expectations around market conditions in the second half, which we now see as softer than our previous views, and are informed by third-party data as well as the trends we experienced in the second quarter. In addition, we've seen a soft start to July with disruptions from Hurricane Beryl, a more pronounced industrial shutdown around the July 4th holiday, and impacts from the CrowdStrike outage that began late last week. Within industrial, the lagging industrial production activity remains a headwind for the business. The industrial economy continues to operate in the longest period of contraction, as defined by PMI levels below 50, since the great financial crisis. Our original outlook for 2024 assumed we would see an uplift in manufacturing activity entering the second half of 2024 in connection with easing interest rates. We now believe the improvement in the industrial backdrop is going to come much later in 2024 with very little benefit to our revenues for the year as the timing of interest rate cuts, if any, remains unclear. In our European and US automotive business, market conditions continue to moderate as consumers are impacted by a wide range of factors, including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical election uncertainty. For gross margin, we now expect 40 basis points to 60 basis points of full-year gross margin expansion, primarily driven by our continuous focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives, as well as benefits from our acquisitions in US automotive not previously included in our outlook. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 50 basis points and 60 basis points, compared to our previous range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of deleverage. Our revised SG&A outlook takes into consideration our reduced sales outlook which drives further deleverage as well as the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the US automotive business. Our views include the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For global automotive segment margin, we now expect to be approximately flat with last year. For 2024, we expect global industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are competent in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs, partner with technology that enhances our customer experience. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust, and we will continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around the mix of company-owned stores at our US automotive business. In closing, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions, including advancing our global restructuring activities to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. We believe the backdrop of lower sales growth is market driven and not specific to our business, and we are well positioned once the cycle turns more favorable. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and will continue to invest with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Go ahead please.\nBret Jordan: Hey, good morning guys.\nWill Stengel: Good morning, Bret.\nBret Jordan: Will, your comment about independents expecting more normalized buying behavior in the balance of the year, could you give us, I guess, more color? I think they destocked late in \u201823 and then bought in pretty well in the beginning of \u201824. I guess, how do you see the cadence working out?\nWill Stengel: Yeah, look, we've seen continuous sequential improvement on that topic. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all the initiatives that we're working on here in US automotive are affecting both company-owned and independent-owned stores. And so when we think about inventory strategies, service excellence, those initiatives are all relevant for what we're doing with the independent owners. And we've seen nice sequential improvement through the year. We would expect that to continue through the balance of the year. The math of how that works, I won't get into the specifics, but the tone is good, the relationships are good, the partnership\u2019s good. We had a bunch of independent owners into Atlanta just last week, and everyone's got their hand in the huddle and committed to continuing to grow the business and compete in the local markets.\nBret Jordan: Okay, great. And then on Europe, is there anything notable, I guess, regionally? I mean, France has had some political backdrop, I mean, you're talking about sort of softening in that market, but is there anything to attribute it to, sort of from a geographic standpoint, or is it just widespread?\nWill Stengel: It's more widespread than it was probably 90 to 100 days ago. Just to be clear, we're really pleased with the European performance. I mean the business continues to grow and grow profitably. The M&A pipeline is having its effect with very accretive acquisitions. In particular, our Spanish and Portuguese businesses after their acquisition last year continue to perform really well. They're a standout. NAPA brand is a differentiator as part of that to help us compete in the market. But we've seen some softness earlier in the year in the UK and France, I would say. It's moderated growth through the balance of the business, call it Germany, Benelux, et cetera. But the business is still performing in excess of market and we think we're winning share. So, tougher times, but proud of what the team's executing over there.\nBret Jordan: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Go ahead please.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys.\nWill Stengel: Good morning, Scot.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hi. You guys referenced a few times about your pricing issues is providing a boost to gross margins for your auto business. I'm assuming that is code for raising prices. So with that context, at what point do you start to run into competitive pricing issues, especially in an environment where the WDs become more price competitive and one of your public competitors is actively reducing prices?\nWill Stengel: Yeah, Scot, thanks for the question. I think our pricing strategies are more holistic than just raising prices. And so as we've talked about before, we talked about it through the prism of category management which is the intersection between not just pricing but also sourcing and in some -- at the SKU level, and some SKUs are going up and many others you're going down as well and the challenge that we put to the category managers across the business has net-net positioned us in a better margin profile as we move forward both on the sourcing and pricing side. So we're being very thoughtful about being competitive in the market on certain categories and we're balancing that with a lot of very scientific and thoughtful technology work that we've done around data analytics to make sure that we've got visibility down at the local field level to compete and win.\nBert Nappier: And, Scot, this is Bert. I\u2019ll just amplify that a little bit with -- in the quarter the gross margin improvement was skewed to the majority side from acquisitions. So we're seeing a nice benefit from the new acquisitions in US automotive. And just to parse out how we think about this split between sourcing and pricing, where you would have seen a bigger benefit in 2023 from pricing, we're actually drawing most of our benefit this year on the back of the work that Will just described in category management and sourcing. So again, pricing is a complex topic. It's a lot of moving things up and down to be competitive. So I wouldn't just categorize it as we're moving prices up. It's a lot of moving pieces here, but we're also getting this nice benefit from acquisitions as well.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay, thanks. And then kind of related to that, when you guys go, you've been on a pretty active sequence, trying to acquire some of your independence. When you guys own a store rather than selling product to an independent or wholesale relationship, can you give us some generalized color just regarding the sales and gross -- the profit dollar contributions once you own that business?\nBert Nappier: Yes, so that's one of the benefits of this pivoting strategy. So we see the mix shifting to more company-owned, continue to lean in on the independent owner model as we have in the past. So we'll have this hybrid model going forward, but as we look at isolation of adding more company owned stores, the benefits come across a few prisms. First, commercially, we'll stop sharing the margin. So we see a difference there in terms of recapturing some of the margin that we were sharing previously and you're seeing some of that come through in what we've seen in the second quarter here. Secondarily, when you just start at the very top of the house and you think about the commercial transaction itself, we'll have more control over the transaction from the outset. So that means the price in the market will have the ability to adjust and flex the depth and breadth of inventory in the market to be competitive. Some of those things were tension points between the independent owner and us before. And then as you move through the rest of the P&L, we obviously get benefits from SG&A. We're able to simplify and streamline the back office. In many cases, the independent owner had their own back office, which we can leverage our own, we'll be able to capture some of the benefits from technology and continuing to drive technology into the stores and create some incremental leverage on some of the supply chain elements as well. Many of these independent owners had their own small stocking and many kind of offsite locations that we obviously wouldn't need. So as you move through the different elements of the P&L, I think we have a lot of goodness there. We bought a great business here in the second quarter with the MPEC business, and we're already seeing benefits of that coming through our P&L. So we're excited about this pivot. The team is doing an outstanding job in terms of integration and execution and bringing these folks on board.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thanks guys.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Scot.\nBert Nappier: Thanks, Scot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. We wondered just within DIFM if you're seeing any notable strengths or weaknesses by customer segment? And also within automotive, if you could talk to product categories that were the strongest, and if there was any meaningful change when the warmer weather came in in late June, early July?\nWill Stengel: Yeah, Kate, thanks for your question. On the customer segment side for commercial, we actually have seen relative strength, as we said in our prepared remarks, in the auto care fleet and other wholesale for us. Our headwind continues to be our major account business. And if you look at and decomp major account, there's different pieces inside of that book of business, ranging from regional accounts to the big national guys, OE dealerships, et cetera. And so there are some customer specific challenges in that book of business, but I'll tell you, there's just as many recent wins, certainly on the regional accounts that we were talking about the other day as a team that we're really excited about that should position as well as we come through the second half of this year and into next year. So we're being really thoughtful in that major account book of business to make sure that it's a win-win economic relationship for NAPA and the customer. And so we're going to be pretty disciplined as we think about that going forward. From a category standpoint, we have seen some positive trends based on recent weather in all the categories that you would expect. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the inventory progress that we've made through the first half of the year has been quite fruitful and so those targeted categories we've seen nice momentum as we go through. So the category managers are really doing a very nice job and our sales folks out in the field on the commercial side are also being very thoughtful as well. We're proud of the teams.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Kate.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Go ahead please.\nChristian Carlino: Hi, good morning. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. So the industrial guide assumes that comps or sales growth accelerates to low single-digits in the back half. And understanding you have the extra day phenomenon, just, can you speak to what else drives this acceleration? And is there any appetite to start up larger capital projects or is it at this point really just break fix until after the election?\nBert Nappier: Yeah, Christian, it's Bert. I'll take that one. And maybe as we think about guide, it's just important to refresh on how we thought about the year when the year started and then where things have moved. When we started the year, we expected a moderated first half, stronger second half and a lot of our second half view was based on better industrial production and that being stimulated by interest rates. That model wasn't overly precise, so we didn't have a specific rate cut time to industrial growth or timing of industrial growth, and I think it was more philosophical like many companies about easing interest rates would be supportive of industrial production. As Q2 developed, which included some softer market conditions across industrial, we really have updated our outlook on that side of the house based on that updated view. And we think that with some third-party data, the industrial production activity will continue to lag, it'll still be a headwind for the business as we move here into the third quarter and getting into the fourth quarter as well. We really expected at this point based on our original view to enter the second half of the year with some better kind of low single-digit mid-single-digit growth in Motion and in our industrial side of the house and that's obviously not happening. So we've pushed that out a bit. We -- operating this period of PMI that's been down for quite some time and so now as we look we think that comes much later in the year in terms of improvement. Again, a function of interest rate cuts and we all can take our own predictions on those. Q3, I think we would have parked in our old guidance at somewhere at mid-single-digit, exiting the year at high single-digit. I think we'll see the rest of this year play out in the low single-digit range at best, as we indicated at the top end of our sales guidance and look for improvement as we move through the back half of the year and into 2025.\nWill Stengel: Hey, Christian, I might just add a couple other thoughts. Obviously, the year-over-year compares ease in the second half of this year. And so as we do the two-year stack and kind of year-over-year compares, that's something that we've spent a lot of time thinking about. The other thing I would tell you just commercially, we've had a lot of discussion with the Motion business and all the leaders about stepping up the sales intensity of the business And as I suggested in my prepared remarks, the discussions we're having with our customers are very positive in the sense that they understand our value proposition. They're great strategic partners. They want to do more business with us. And as a result, you're seeing a lot of renewals of corporate accounts as well as some sales initiatives that is incremental to existing business. So, again, we're working on the right stuff in the Motion business. It's a choppy market. But once we get that sales growth and the customers start spending, we're going to be in a great position.\nBert Nappier: And, Christian, just on the specific point about capital projects, I mean, the feedback from the customer is, look, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, high interest rates. Capital projects at this point are must-do activities. So we're really seeing some tempering there on that spend. And again, to Will's point, we're having great wins and renewals with customers. And as this interest rate environment, I think, eases, we'll start to see things move.\nChristian Carlino: Got it. That's really helpful. And just a follow up on Kate's question, I guess what do you think drove the acceleration in US NAPA over the quarter? Was it weather that abated as you got into May? Or is it starting to lap some of the early signs of deferral you saw last year? And just any comments on what you're seeing in terms of maintenance deferrals. Is that getting worse?\nWill Stengel: Yeah. I mean, look, I think April, as we've talked about, was super tough. I don't think that was new news for anybody. And so it's all relative. We were kind of working off a low base, and we saw sequential improvement. The initiatives are making a difference. The MPEC acquisition helped build some momentum through the quarter, and the weather did help. So that all being said, it's hard to extrapolate the trend out of the second quarter. I think that's some of the challenge with how we're thinking about the guide. July was a little bit choppy based on what we articulated. So pleased with the sequential improvement through the second quarter, but trying to make sense of the world and the macro environment that we find ourselves as we come into the second half.\nChristian Carlino: Got it. Thanks very much. Best of luck.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Christian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on that last point, guys. The start in July is choppy. So it sounds like -- was July as bad as April? Or is it something between the exit rate of June and April?\nBert Nappier: Well, Greg, I reserve the right to vote on July since it's not over yet. But look, April was a tough month for sure. Will has already articulated that. And as I said in my prepared comments, I think July has started out with a lot of mixed views. So we've got some disruption from Hurricane Beryl that impacted both of our US businesses on the automotive and Motion side. We've had some additional industrial production shutdown around the 4th of July holiday. I think manufacturers are taking advantage of any slowdown in a holiday to cut a little bit of their own costs and pull back on some costs there. And then obviously, we had a CrowdStrike outage that began late last week, and that's impacted many, many businesses. We were down for a brief part of the day, and Naveen and the teams around the world did an outstanding job of bringing us back up very quickly. So while we've taken care of our own house, part of the impact of that will continue to be how our customers and down the chain feel that impact across their businesses. So, look, I wouldn't compare April and July just yet. As I said, July is not over, but April certainly was a tough month. And I think the thing that is a challenge for us is just all these different pieces of noise create some lack of clarity into the true trend. Back to Christian's question a minute ago, how do you parse some of this out? And I think these are the things that we're looking at, but I feel good about where we are and all the work we're doing.\nWill Stengel: Yeah, Greg, I would just come over the top on that and emphasize the point that we feel good about the work that we're doing. And the tone of our meetings is positive. Everyone appreciates that it's a tough market, but the specific initiatives at NAPA or Motion or any one of our businesses is the right body of work. And at some point, hopefully soon, as the market recovers, we'll have a couple of nice tailwinds behind us.\nGreg Melich: Great. And my follow-up is maybe digging a little deeper on the consumer environment and the end market. Have you seen any sort of trade down or deferral of projects? Are you seeing that where just consumers are like, I\u2019m out of money, and I'm just going to wait on things? Can you see that in the data?\nWill Stengel: We don't see it empirically in the data, but qualitatively, we have seen that. The other challenge that we put to the merchant is making sure that the good, better, best assortment logic kind of plays in every market condition and for every customer. And so we've seen some shifting around good, better, best. That's probably the closest data that we can look at to see the psyche of the consumer. And then you also anecdotally, you do hear that the consumer is if they needed to, maybe they only do one kind of phenomenon, with most of our big kind of major accounts. Those discussions are pretty consistent across the landscape. So we're seeing it, but I think we're well positioned in the market environment with how we're positioning our brands.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then, I guess, last on that, it sounds like do you think you gained share in the quarter, in both industrial and auto?\nWill Stengel: We feel good about what we're doing. Quarter-to-quarter, we're the first one out of the gate. Hard to kind of fixate on all things share. The feedback that we get qualitatively from the supplier community, honestly, as has never been better. And I think that's just a reflection of another data point to support that the work that we're doing is all the right stuff. We've just got to keep our head down and keep sequentially improving.\nGreg Melich: Great. Thanks and good luck, guys.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS Securities. Go ahead please.\nHenry Carr: Good morning. This is Henry Carr on for Michael Lasser. Thanks a lot for taking our questions this morning. I wanted to ask, so assuming third quarter demand looks similar to second quarter, are you anticipating those pressure callouts of 50 basis points from increased salaries and wages, [Technical Difficulty] Are these pretty much going to be pretty consistent in third quarter, would you say?\nBert Nappier: Hi, Henry, thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year. We've talked about some things already with Greg's question around the start to July. So we do have some things that we're managing through here in the month. I won't give quarterly guidance, but as we frame the rest of the year, Will talked about easing top line comps. But when we look at the third quarter specifically, to your point, we will continue to see deleverage in the business for many of those factors and the combination of a lower sales outlook for the rest of the year. Given that, I would tell you that we expect Q3 earnings to be down year-over-year, mostly because we see a lot of this persisting, particularly coming out of the second quarter and particularly with the softness on the industrial side of the house. With that, we would see Q4 being a little stronger on a relative basis. But as you know, there's plenty of things to think about in the fourth quarter with holidays and the weather. So I would just say, look, we've got an elevated degree of uncertainty in how we're forecasting from earlier in the year, particularly on the trends in industrial. But we're giving you all the information we have right now, everything we think, including all the other variables that are out there, with interest rates and elections and all of that are reflected in our guide.\nHenry Carr: Great. Thank you. And for a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about with the increased M&A of company-owned stores, I think it's increased to roughly 30% of mix. Does -- when we think about M&A as a contribution to sales growth moving forward, is that 1% target given at the Investor Day in 2023 still a good kind of benchmark to gauge with?\nBert Nappier: I think so, Henry. I mean I think that's a fair proxy. I mean, obviously, it will flux in any given year, a little higher maybe in a year where we do something like KDG. But I think if you're using that for a modeling point, I think it's a fair enough proxy, particularly when you look back over the history of GPC over many years. So let's just leave it there and you guys keep using that number as a reasonable proxy.\nHenry Carr: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush. Go ahead please.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. First, congrats on the appointment of CEO Will, and best wishes to Paul.\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Seth.\nSeth Basham: My first question is just a follow-up to the last one. In terms of your goal related to acquiring independents, 30% of the mix of stores now I don't know that you have a stated goal necessarily, but do you expect continued strong acquisitions for the next couple of years?\nBert Nappier: Yeah. Look, Seth, I would tell you that we don't have a stated goal at this point. We're just in the early innings of this pivot. We've made some nice progress here in the second quarter. That move up to 30% came on the back of the acquisition of our largest independent owner. And we're going to continue to be opportunistic as we look at these. We obviously are trying to focus on target markets. I would tell you those lean a little bit more towards urban areas. The independent owner will continue to be an important part of our ecosystem. We have tremendously strong independent owners. They provide us strength in key markets, particularly in rural markets. They have deep relationships. We have great scale and good capabilities with all of them. And so we'll continue to have that hybrid. As we think about the March forward, I think we'll be more acquisitive as we move through the course of this year. But that will be based on the timing of these individual discussions. It's a willing buyer and a willing seller. And we've had some good luck here, bought a great business with MPEC, but it's not a one-size-fits-all, and we'll continue to let that go and come to us as it does.\nWill Stengel: Hey, Seth, maybe just a couple of other points. I mean I think we said in the script, it's not linear. So we started with the largest independent owner and transacted there. But obviously, we have a lot of smaller owners and so building nice momentum, but it's not linear. Just to make a finer point, we're 70-30-ish today. Three years ago, that was more like 20-80. So to help calibrate the last two to three years, we've made really nice progress. We continue to do that. That being said, the independent owner will always have a role in the NAPA operating model, and we value those relationships and look forward to working with those as we continue to align to win in the local markets.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And can you quantify the benefit to gross margin in the quarter from the independents acquisition? And [Technical Difficulty].\nBert Nappier: Yeah. We said that number was right around 30 basis points. So of the 50 basis points improvement in gross margin, all acquisitions contributed about 30 basis points.\nSeth Basham: And similar impact for the full year expected?\nBert Nappier: I didn't parse out the improvement for the rest of the year. We lifted the guidance for gross margin, primarily on the back of some of that goodness. So I'll let you guys kind of parse that out, how you want, but we're not being quite that specific in terms of how we thought about it. We know there'll be more benefit coming out of gross margin because of acquisitions, but also because of the great work we're doing across the business.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And my follow-up question is on the major [Technical Difficulty] segment in the US. You talked about discipline there, Will. Are you giving up business there where you don't see it economical? Or is the pressure there more related to elevated levels of deferred maintenance?\nWill Stengel: I wouldn't say we're giving up business, I would say we're having active discussions with customers to make sure that we've got a path to have it be a win-win. And as we think about incremental new business, we're bringing another level of perspective to that and defining what's helpful to the business. All of that obviously there's trade-offs to all things kind of pursuing new sales. And so each customer is a specific discussion and its own situation. We're just, I think, focusing a little bit more intently on making sure that we're doing right by the business and our customers.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thank you very much.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Seth.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one more question. And our last question will be from Carolina Jolly from Gabelli. Go ahead please.\nCarolina Jolly: Hi, thank you for answering my questions. Will, congratulations, and that was a really, really great tribute to Paul. So thanks for that as well.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Carolina.\nCarolina Jolly: First question is just around the modernization of supply chain you mentioning. Does that also require or imply more inventory?\nBert Nappier: No, Carolina, I think as we modernize DCs, it's actually probably one in which we optimize inventory, not have to stock and add more. I'll just give you an example of some of the big projects where when we look at an Australian DC consolidation of other satellite facilities around it into one, same thing happening with two different projects in Europe. And so actually, what we're seeing is it gives us a chance to be a little bit smarter and probably not have to be quite as broad in different locations and concentrated into one and maybe even get a little bit deeper in terms of what we're doing. They obviously have been designed and put in locations where they shorten stem times and lead times to get to the distribution network on the ground. That's helpful as well. So I don't think modernization of supply chain is a net negative for the inventory side of the balance sheet. I think it's actually a long-term net positive particularly when you combine it with some of the other things we're doing with service. And then if you look at the Motion side of the house, what they're doing with the fulfillment centers we've talked about in the past as well.\nCarolina Jolly: And then just a quick question. Do you date on the regional disparity [Technical Difficulty]?\nWill Stengel: Yeah, we had relative strength, call it, in the middle part of the country. For the quarter, the West Coast, East Coast was a little bit challenged relative to the balance of the country, but nothing material that I would suggest is a trend or a commercial challenge.\nCarolina Jolly: Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Carolina.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before we turn to the results of the quarter, I'd like to share a few thoughts as part of my transition into the CEO role over the last 45 days. First and foremost, it's an honor and a privilege to serve as only the sixth CEO in Genuine Parts Company's nearly 100-year history. GPC has a special culture which was founded on taking care of our people and offering solutions to our customers efficiently and consistently. This has served our business incredibly well over the years and will remain a core element of our foundation. As part of the transition over the last several months, I've spent time engaging with our teammates, customers, and suppliers around the world. I'll share a few key messages that have come out of those discussions and that are areas of emphasis as we move forward. First, leverage our culture as an advantage. We have a unique and differentiated culture. Our global engagement data shows the vast majority of our employees are incredibly proud to work for GPC. That's a fact of which we are proud and is a testament to our strong, consistent leadership over the years. We must nurture our culture to extend our unique advantage, but we must also continuously evolve with our customers and our markets. Second, build high-performing teams. Our talent strategies have been intentional as we continuously work to be an employer of choice. We have a capable group of leaders around the world that have aligned values and a clear understanding of our shared vision. But we amplify our impact when we relentlessly build high-performing teams throughout the organization, who are energized to work together, solve problems, and deliver results. Third, capture our exciting opportunities. We streamline GPC to focus on two core businesses with market-leading positions and significant exciting opportunities. We believe size and scale creates an advantage, and when we work together as we invest in capabilities and share best practices to solve common challenges, we act faster, we're more efficient, and we create value. Fourth, focus and execute our defined plans. We believe we have the right strategies and initiatives in place. We've worked together over the last three to four years as a global organization to understand our opportunities and prioritize the work that we're doing. We align globally around five key priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology, complemented by a disciplined acquisition strategy. This focused approach is not changing. We're intentional, we're disciplined, and we're leveraging expertise around the world to reduce complexity, improve the customer experience, deliver profitable growth, and increase productivity. And lastly, play to win and continuously improve. Thanks to the hard work of our teammates, we've made great progress as a company over recent years. But we're focused on continuous sequential improvement to build on our momentum. We can't be satisfied with good, instead striving to be great, always working to be better and faster in all that we do. Overall, it's fair to say I'm more energized than ever about the opportunities we have as a company and the future for Genuine Parts Company. I want to thank each of our over 60,000 global GPC teammates for their ongoing passion for serving our customers. In addition to serving our customers every day, our teams are executing and delivering on a broad set of initiatives while navigating a dynamic and challenging macro environment. Thank you to all, as always, for your good hard work. Now, let's turn to the specifics of our quarterly results. A few highlights for the second quarter include total GPC sales of $6 billion, which increased approximately 1% versus the same period in the prior year and included a tough start to the quarter with particularly weak sales month in April across both segments. Total company gross margin increased 50 basis points with continued execution of strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. And in May, we announced the acquisition of Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation, our largest NAPA independent owner in the US with a network of 181 locations across Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It's a great example of our ongoing initiative to own more NAPA stores in priority markets. Our second quarter results were below our expectations. The variance can be attributed to three key themes. Weaker than anticipated customer demand in industrial, accelerated softness in Europe, and choppy demand in the automotive aftermarket in the US. Many factors outside of our control, including higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and persistent inflation are driving overall weaker customer demand. This weaker demand environment and ongoing cost inflation resulted in adjusted earnings flat year-over-year for the quarter, which Burt will cover in more detail shortly. Looking at our results by business segment. During the second quarter, total sales for global industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% versus the same period last year, and comparable sales were down 1.6%. When we look at the sales performance for our industrial business, the main headwind remains lagging industrial production activity. Over the past 20 months, manufacturing PMI readings continue to be in the longest period of contraction since the financial crisis in 2009, as represented by a PMI index below 50. While we saw a positive reading in March, during the second quarter, the monthly PMI readings reverted back into contraction territory versus our cautiously optimistic expectation of an improving backdrop coming out of the first quarter. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were softer in April and relatively flat in May and June. In addition, the higher interest rate environment and election uncertainty is curbing larger capital spending decisions across our diversified customer base as they remain cautious. Looking at Motion's results across its end market served, we're still seeing mixed performance across the board. Five of our 14 end markets showed positive growth during the second quarter, which was in line with the first quarter, with relative strength coming from mining and chemicals, offset by weakness in equipment and machinery, fabricated metals, and aggregates and cement. Despite the market softness, Motion's corporate account customer base, which represents approximately 45% of the business, continues to perform well and is showing positive growth, which is a true testament to Motion's strong value proposition. Additionally, during the second quarter, the Motion team successfully renewed several key multi-year corporate account agreements and remains active with various well-defined field sales initiatives. Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $277 million, down approximately 2% versus prior year and 12.4% of sales, representing an approximate 10 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our business in North America performed well despite the softer sales performance, but was offset by pressure from our business in Australasia, given the challenging local economic environment and cost pressures. Turning to the global automotive segment, sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of 2%, with comparable store sales decreasing 0.6%. During the quarter, all of our automotive geographies showed positive sales growth in local currency. Similar to the first quarter, the global automotive sales benefit from inflation remained less than 1% in the second quarter, and we expect the same in the back half of the year. Global automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $314 million, down 4.7% versus prior year and 8.4% of sales, representing a 60 basis point decrease from the same period last year. Our second quarter results for the global automotive segment reflect pressures from a challenging sales environment across our geographies, combined with inflation driving higher costs and outpacing sales growth. Now, let's turn to our automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our team delivered total sales growth of approximately 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We've seen a broadening in the moderation in demand across our geographies in Europe through the quarter. We believe this is driven by an incrementally more cautious consumer, as well as a reduced sales benefit from inflation, which is also now less than 1%. Despite this, our teams are focused on serving our customers, delivering on our strategic initiatives and delivering above-market performance. We're winning share with target key accounts and the NAPA brand expansion continues to be a differentiator. For 2024, we're on track to deliver sales of NAPA branded products in excess of EUR500 million, above our initial internal target. Our ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity also continues to have a positive impact and create value in Europe. In the AsiaPac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 3% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 2%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to a high single-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail increased in the second quarter, with retail showing relative strength. The macro environment remains challenging in the region but the teams are executing well to grow in excess of market and take advantage of their industry leading position. In Canada, sales increased 1% in local currency during the second quarter, with comparable sales decreasing approximately 2%. Our Canadian team showed sequential improvement from the first quarter despite ongoing pressure from a more cautious consumer and difficult macro environment. Sales in automotive and heavy vehicle performed similarly during the quarter with both having slightly positive growth. In the US, automotive sales increased 0.5% during the second quarter, with comparable sales decreasing 1.5%. This represents a slight improvement in our reported results sequentially from the first quarter and was generally in line with our expectations. As we looked at our sales cadence through the quarter, average daily sales growth was pressured in April and then showed solid sequential improvement throughout the remainder of the quarter. Our overall results also benefited from our MPEC acquisition in May. From a customer segment perspective, sales to our commercial and do-it-yourself customers were both slightly down during the quarter with commercial outpacing do-it-yourself. For commercial, fleet and government, auto care, and other wholesale were all essentially in line, while major accounts underperformed the group, driven by continued cautious end consumer, as we're seeing elevated levels of deferrals from customers on certain repairs. For sales into our independent store owners, we saw another quarter of more normalized buying behavior, which is a trend we believe will continue throughout the balance of the year. We have active initiatives across our US automotive business and we're encouraged by the progress in the improvements that they're delivering. During the second quarter we saw further improvements in inventory fill rates and stocking levels for specific categories where we had opportunity. Additionally, the team continues to elevate the execution in our stores and DCs, which is driving better customer service metrics. We're pleased with these results, but we're intensely focused on continuous sequential improvement. And finally, we're making good progress on our initiative to evolve our operating model at US automotive to own more stores in selected priority markets. Our recent acquisitions of independent stores are being integrated into the NAPA network with a focus on improved performance and synergy capture. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operational excellence in both company owned and independently owned stores. During the second quarter we acquired 242 NAPA stores from our independent owners as well as competitive stores and key markets. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We'll continue to make methodical progress with our strategy of owning more stores in the second half of the year as the pipeline remains active, although we don't expect the recent acquisition pace to be linear through the year. With all these evolving factors in mind, we moderated our 2024 outlook for sales and earnings per share. We believe it's prudent to adjust our expectations for the second half of the year based on the current information available to us, particularly as it pertains to the industrial and European market outlook. And Bert will provide further color in a moment. While our quarterly results reflect a softer economic backdrop than we anticipated, our in-flight initiatives and fundamental prospects for our business remain robust. Within automotive, industry fundamentals like miles driven, the age of the car park, and new and used vehicle prices remain supportive. We benefit from the fact that NAPA's core business serves the commercial customer where many repairs are non-discretionary and break fix in nature. We like this position as we view the commercial customer as the growth engine of the industry given the increasingly complex vehicle fleet. Within industrial, our business is well diversified across 14 and growing different end markets that cover a wide range of the manufacturing economy, and we're positioned well to take advantage when economic conditions improved. Studying PMI cycles over time, we see a pattern of long periods of attractive growth once the index inflects into an expansion territory. Motion's highly technical sales expertise and solutions-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep their operations functioning effectively every day and in every market cycle. As the market leader, we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on the eventual improvement in the manufacturing economy, near and long term, as we expand our customer base and grow share of wallet in this fragmented market. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Bert, on behalf of the entire company, it's only fitting that I take a moment and extend our gratitude to Paul Donahue, not only for his tenure as CEO, but for his many contributions to Genuine Parts Company over his 20-year career. Under Paul's leadership as CEO, the company strategically evolved and transformed for the better. A few highlight accomplishments under Paul's leadership. He simplified the GPC business mix to enable strategic focus on our automotive and industrial segments. He championed the expansion of GPC around the world, growing our global footprint from six countries in 2016 to 17 countries in 2024, including the transformational acquisition of AAG in Europe. He led us through a pandemic and kept our team safe. He kept our culture thriving and he kept our teams operating to ensure we took care of our customers. He accelerated strategic investments of over $2 billion in growth capital, including the transformational acquisition of Kaman Distribution Group to extend our industrial leadership position, and obviously many other accomplishments. Altogether since 2016, GPC has grown its sales from $15 billion to approximately $24 billion. It goes without saying that Paul's positive impact on GPC has been remarkable. His ability to lead our teammates around the world has been inspiring and he's a tremendous steward of our GPC culture, importantly a good friend to all, and we certainly look forward to his continued counsel and his role as Executive Chairman. Thank you again to the entire GPC team around the world, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Good morning, Bret. Yeah, look, we've seen continuous sequential improvement on that topic. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all the initiatives that we're working on here in US automotive are affecting both company-owned and independent-owned stores. And so when we think about inventory strategies, service excellence, those initiatives are all relevant for what we're doing with the independent owners. And we've seen nice sequential improvement through the year. We would expect that to continue through the balance of the year. The math of how that works, I won't get into the specifics, but the tone is good, the relationships are good, the partnership's good. We had a bunch of independent owners into Atlanta just last week, and everyone's got their hand in the huddle and committed to continuing to grow the business and compete in the local markets. It's more widespread than it was probably 90 to 100 days ago. Just to be clear, we're really pleased with the European performance. I mean the business continues to grow and grow profitably. The M&A pipeline is having its effect with very accretive acquisitions. In particular, our Spanish and Portuguese businesses after their acquisition last year continue to perform really well. They're a standout. NAPA brand is a differentiator as part of that to help us compete in the market. But we've seen some softness earlier in the year in the UK and France, I would say. It's moderated growth through the balance of the business, call it Germany, Benelux, et cetera. But the business is still performing in excess of market and we think we're winning share. So, tougher times, but proud of what the team's executing over there. Good morning, Scot. Yeah, Scot, thanks for the question. I think our pricing strategies are more holistic than just raising prices. And so as we've talked about before, we talked about it through the prism of category management which is the intersection between not just pricing but also sourcing and in some -- at the SKU level, and some SKUs are going up and many others you're going down as well and the challenge that we put to the category managers across the business has net-net positioned us in a better margin profile as we move forward both on the sourcing and pricing side. So we're being very thoughtful about being competitive in the market on certain categories and we're balancing that with a lot of very scientific and thoughtful technology work that we've done around data analytics to make sure that we've got visibility down at the local field level to compete and win. Thanks, Scot. Yeah, Kate, thanks for your question. On the customer segment side for commercial, we actually have seen relative strength, as we said in our prepared remarks, in the auto care fleet and other wholesale for us. Our headwind continues to be our major account business. And if you look at and decomp major account, there's different pieces inside of that book of business, ranging from regional accounts to the big national guys, OE dealerships, et cetera. And so there are some customer specific challenges in that book of business, but I'll tell you, there's just as many recent wins, certainly on the regional accounts that we were talking about the other day as a team that we're really excited about that should position as well as we come through the second half of this year and into next year. So we're being really thoughtful in that major account book of business to make sure that it's a win-win economic relationship for NAPA and the customer. And so we're going to be pretty disciplined as we think about that going forward. From a category standpoint, we have seen some positive trends based on recent weather in all the categories that you would expect. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the inventory progress that we've made through the first half of the year has been quite fruitful and so those targeted categories we've seen nice momentum as we go through. So the category managers are really doing a very nice job and our sales folks out in the field on the commercial side are also being very thoughtful as well. We're proud of the teams. Thanks, Kate. Hey, Christian, I might just add a couple other thoughts. Obviously, the year-over-year compares ease in the second half of this year. And so as we do the two-year stack and kind of year-over-year compares, that's something that we've spent a lot of time thinking about. The other thing I would tell you just commercially, we've had a lot of discussion with the Motion business and all the leaders about stepping up the sales intensity of the business And as I suggested in my prepared remarks, the discussions we're having with our customers are very positive in the sense that they understand our value proposition. They're great strategic partners. They want to do more business with us. And as a result, you're seeing a lot of renewals of corporate accounts as well as some sales initiatives that is incremental to existing business. So, again, we're working on the right stuff in the Motion business. It's a choppy market. But once we get that sales growth and the customers start spending, we're going to be in a great position. Yeah. I mean, look, I think April, as we've talked about, was super tough. I don't think that was new news for anybody. And so it's all relative. We were kind of working off a low base, and we saw sequential improvement. The initiatives are making a difference. The MPEC acquisition helped build some momentum through the quarter, and the weather did help. So that all being said, it's hard to extrapolate the trend out of the second quarter. I think that's some of the challenge with how we're thinking about the guide. July was a little bit choppy based on what we articulated. So pleased with the sequential improvement through the second quarter, but trying to make sense of the world and the macro environment that we find ourselves as we come into the second half. Thanks, Christian. Yeah, Greg, I would just come over the top on that and emphasize the point that we feel good about the work that we're doing. And the tone of our meetings is positive. Everyone appreciates that it's a tough market, but the specific initiatives at NAPA or Motion or any one of our businesses is the right body of work. And at some point, hopefully soon, as the market recovers, we'll have a couple of nice tailwinds behind us. We don't see it empirically in the data, but qualitatively, we have seen that. The other challenge that we put to the merchant is making sure that the good, better, best assortment logic kind of plays in every market condition and for every customer. And so we've seen some shifting around good, better, best. That's probably the closest data that we can look at to see the psyche of the consumer. And then you also anecdotally, you do hear that the consumer is if they needed to, maybe they only do one kind of phenomenon, with most of our big kind of major accounts. Those discussions are pretty consistent across the landscape. So we're seeing it, but I think we're well positioned in the market environment with how we're positioning our brands. We feel good about what we're doing. Quarter-to-quarter, we're the first one out of the gate. Hard to kind of fixate on all things share. The feedback that we get qualitatively from the supplier community, honestly, as has never been better. And I think that's just a reflection of another data point to support that the work that we're doing is all the right stuff. We've just got to keep our head down and keep sequentially improving. Thanks, Greg. Thank you, Seth. Hey, Seth, maybe just a couple of other points. I mean I think we said in the script, it's not linear. So we started with the largest independent owner and transacted there. But obviously, we have a lot of smaller owners and so building nice momentum, but it's not linear. Just to make a finer point, we're 70-30-ish today. Three years ago, that was more like 20-80. So to help calibrate the last two to three years, we've made really nice progress. We continue to do that. That being said, the independent owner will always have a role in the NAPA operating model, and we value those relationships and look forward to working with those as we continue to align to win in the local markets. I wouldn't say we're giving up business, I would say we're having active discussions with customers to make sure that we've got a path to have it be a win-win. And as we think about incremental new business, we're bringing another level of perspective to that and defining what's helpful to the business. All of that obviously there's trade-offs to all things kind of pursuing new sales. And so each customer is a specific discussion and its own situation. We're just, I think, focusing a little bit more intently on making sure that we're doing right by the business and our customers. Thanks, Seth. Thanks, Carolina. Yeah, we had relative strength, call it, in the middle part of the country. For the quarter, the West Coast, East Coast was a little bit challenged relative to the balance of the country, but nothing material that I would suggest is a trend or a commercial challenge. Thanks, Carolina."

            "name": "Bert Nappier",
            "content": "Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results were below our expectations, as market conditions, including lagging industrial production and weaker demand in our US automotives and European businesses negatively impacted our performance. Despite the muted market backdrop, our teams continue to operate with discipline and are making progress on priority strategic investments necessary for the business. The softer market conditions combined with the impact of inflation and acquired businesses on SG&A resulted in flat adjusted earnings year-over-year. With that context, let me take a few moments to comment on more specific details of the quarter along with our updated view on our outlook for the year. My comments this morning will focus primarily on adjusted results, which exclude the non-recurring cost related to our previously announced global restructuring program and transaction costs related to the acquisition of MPEC. During the second quarter, we incurred a total of $62 million of costs on a pre-tax basis or $46 million after tax related to restructuring efforts and MPEC integration costs. As we look at the second quarter, total sales were up 0.8% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2.2% contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales and a 0.5% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our automotive and industrial segments, in line with our expectations. For the quarter, our gross margin expanded by 50 basis points from last year, driven in part by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to deliver positive results in our gross margin performance. In addition, the acquisitions we are making in our US automotive business contributed approximately 30 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 29.2% of sales in the second quarter, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. As we look at our expenses for the second quarter, we had a mix of factors, including the following. A negative impact of 50 basis points from increased salaries and wages associated with the acquisitions in US automotive and Europe, particularly from our recent MPEC acquisition. Salaries and wages costs continue to be negatively impacted by mandatory increases in minimum wages in our international businesses. Further, inflationary cost pressure and renewals of leased facilities and acquisitions drove a negative impact of approximately 30 basis points in rent expense. We experienced a negative impact of approximately 10 basis points from our ongoing investments in technology to modernize our business. Interest expense continues to be a headwind in 2024, driving a negative impact of approximately 10 basis points in our expenses. These items are partially upset by cost savings resulting from our global restructuring program of approximately 10 basis points. We expect the incremental SG&A from acquired businesses to abate over time as we execute on our integration plans and capture synergies. As a reminder, we are just 60 days post-close of our MPEC transaction with an integration that is expected to last approximately 24 months. For the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in segment profit and segment margin was primarily driven by the softer sales growth environment and associated deleverage on costs. Our second quarter adjusted net income, which excludes non-recurring expenses of $46 million after tax or $0.33 per diluted share, was $342 million or $2.44 per diluted share, in line with the same period of the prior year. Of the $62 million of non-recurring expense in the second quarter, approximately $37 million was related to our global restructuring program, and the remaining $25 million was related to the MPEC transaction. Our MPEC transaction costs primarily include impairments of leases and leasehold improvements for facilities we will not use as we integrate the business and capture synergies moving forward. Turning to our cash flows. For the first six months of 2024, we generated $612 million in cash from operations, up 34% year-over-year, and $353 million in free cash flow, which was up 40% from the prior year. Our strong cash flow in the first half of 2024 reflects a long-standing hallmark of GPC, which is delivering robust cash flows through low growth cycles. We closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. In 2024, we have invested approximately $260 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures, including $143 million in the second quarter. In addition, we have invested $580 million here today in the form of strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of our largest independent owner, MPEC. With this acquisition, we converted 181 independently owned stores in the Midwest to company owned, bringing our total company owned store count to nearly 30% of our US stores. We expect the acquisition to be accretive both before and after we realize synergies as we capture more commercial opportunities, gross margin, and optimize the SG&A of the acquired business. Our global restructuring initiative to better align our cost structure and assets with the current environment remains on track. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $120 million of costs related to our restructuring efforts, in line with our range of $100 million to $200 million. During the second quarter, we realized approximately $10 million of benefit from our restructuring and expect to deliver a benefit of between $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis, in line with our expectations. Our restructuring efforts are a key element of our work to offset the headwinds of current market conditions and cost inflation across the business. Turning to our outlook, we've updated our views on the remainder of 2024 based on our perspective on current market conditions across the business, most notably for our industrial, European, and US automotive businesses. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $8.55 to $8.75 compared to our previous outlook of $9.05 to $9.20. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.50, up slightly to 2023 at the midpoint of the range. This compares to our previous outlook range of $9.80 to $9.95. Our wider range is reflective of the current macro environment, which has elevated the degree of uncertainty from earlier in 2024, particularly on the trends on the industrial side of the business. Our earnings presentation includes an illustration of the key business drivers impacting our revised outlook for 2024. Let me take a moment and walk through the details of these components, starting with sales. We now expect total sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, down from our previous outlook of 3% to 5%. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels, contributing less than 1% for both business segments. By business segment, we are now guiding to the following. 1% to 3% total sales growth for the automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. And for the industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of flat to 2% with comparable sales growth in the flat to 2% range. Our reduced sales outlook for the year is driven by our updated expectations around market conditions in the second half, which we now see as softer than our previous views, and are informed by third-party data as well as the trends we experienced in the second quarter. In addition, we've seen a soft start to July with disruptions from Hurricane Beryl, a more pronounced industrial shutdown around the July 4th holiday, and impacts from the CrowdStrike outage that began late last week. Within industrial, the lagging industrial production activity remains a headwind for the business. The industrial economy continues to operate in the longest period of contraction, as defined by PMI levels below 50, since the great financial crisis. Our original outlook for 2024 assumed we would see an uplift in manufacturing activity entering the second half of 2024 in connection with easing interest rates. We now believe the improvement in the industrial backdrop is going to come much later in 2024 with very little benefit to our revenues for the year as the timing of interest rate cuts, if any, remains unclear. In our European and US automotive business, market conditions continue to moderate as consumers are impacted by a wide range of factors, including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical election uncertainty. For gross margin, we now expect 40 basis points to 60 basis points of full-year gross margin expansion, primarily driven by our continuous focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives, as well as benefits from our acquisitions in US automotive not previously included in our outlook. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 50 basis points and 60 basis points, compared to our previous range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of deleverage. Our revised SG&A outlook takes into consideration our reduced sales outlook which drives further deleverage as well as the impact of incremental SG&A from acquisitions in the US automotive business. Our views include the expected benefits from our global restructuring activities. For global automotive segment margin, we now expect to be approximately flat with last year. For 2024, we expect global industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are competent in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs, partner with technology that enhances our customer experience. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust, and we will continue to remain disciplined pursuing opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around the mix of company-owned stores at our US automotive business. In closing, we continue to operate in challenging market conditions and are taking actions, including advancing our global restructuring activities to ensure the long-term profitability of the business. We believe the backdrop of lower sales growth is market driven and not specific to our business, and we are well positioned once the cycle turns more favorable. We remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and will continue to invest with a long-term focus. Thank you, and we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. And, Scot, this is Bert. I'll just amplify that a little bit with -- in the quarter the gross margin improvement was skewed to the majority side from acquisitions. So we're seeing a nice benefit from the new acquisitions in US automotive. And just to parse out how we think about this split between sourcing and pricing, where you would have seen a bigger benefit in 2023 from pricing, we're actually drawing most of our benefit this year on the back of the work that Will just described in category management and sourcing. So again, pricing is a complex topic. It's a lot of moving things up and down to be competitive. So I wouldn't just categorize it as we're moving prices up. It's a lot of moving pieces here, but we're also getting this nice benefit from acquisitions as well. Yes, so that's one of the benefits of this pivoting strategy. So we see the mix shifting to more company-owned, continue to lean in on the independent owner model as we have in the past. So we'll have this hybrid model going forward, but as we look at isolation of adding more company owned stores, the benefits come across a few prisms. First, commercially, we'll stop sharing the margin. So we see a difference there in terms of recapturing some of the margin that we were sharing previously and you're seeing some of that come through in what we've seen in the second quarter here. Secondarily, when you just start at the very top of the house and you think about the commercial transaction itself, we'll have more control over the transaction from the outset. So that means the price in the market will have the ability to adjust and flex the depth and breadth of inventory in the market to be competitive. Some of those things were tension points between the independent owner and us before. And then as you move through the rest of the P&L, we obviously get benefits from SG&A. We're able to simplify and streamline the back office. In many cases, the independent owner had their own back office, which we can leverage our own, we'll be able to capture some of the benefits from technology and continuing to drive technology into the stores and create some incremental leverage on some of the supply chain elements as well. Many of these independent owners had their own small stocking and many kind of offsite locations that we obviously wouldn't need. So as you move through the different elements of the P&L, I think we have a lot of goodness there. We bought a great business here in the second quarter with the MPEC business, and we're already seeing benefits of that coming through our P&L. So we're excited about this pivot. The team is doing an outstanding job in terms of integration and execution and bringing these folks on board. Thanks, Scot. Yeah, Christian, it's Bert. I'll take that one. And maybe as we think about guide, it's just important to refresh on how we thought about the year when the year started and then where things have moved. When we started the year, we expected a moderated first half, stronger second half and a lot of our second half view was based on better industrial production and that being stimulated by interest rates. That model wasn't overly precise, so we didn't have a specific rate cut time to industrial growth or timing of industrial growth, and I think it was more philosophical like many companies about easing interest rates would be supportive of industrial production. As Q2 developed, which included some softer market conditions across industrial, we really have updated our outlook on that side of the house based on that updated view. And we think that with some third-party data, the industrial production activity will continue to lag, it'll still be a headwind for the business as we move here into the third quarter and getting into the fourth quarter as well. We really expected at this point based on our original view to enter the second half of the year with some better kind of low single-digit mid-single-digit growth in Motion and in our industrial side of the house and that's obviously not happening. So we've pushed that out a bit. We -- operating this period of PMI that's been down for quite some time and so now as we look we think that comes much later in the year in terms of improvement. Again, a function of interest rate cuts and we all can take our own predictions on those. Q3, I think we would have parked in our old guidance at somewhere at mid-single-digit, exiting the year at high single-digit. I think we'll see the rest of this year play out in the low single-digit range at best, as we indicated at the top end of our sales guidance and look for improvement as we move through the back half of the year and into 2025. And, Christian, just on the specific point about capital projects, I mean, the feedback from the customer is, look, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, high interest rates. Capital projects at this point are must-do activities. So we're really seeing some tempering there on that spend. And again, to Will's point, we're having great wins and renewals with customers. And as this interest rate environment, I think, eases, we'll start to see things move. Well, Greg, I reserve the right to vote on July since it's not over yet. But look, April was a tough month for sure. Will has already articulated that. And as I said in my prepared comments, I think July has started out with a lot of mixed views. So we've got some disruption from Hurricane Beryl that impacted both of our US businesses on the automotive and Motion side. We've had some additional industrial production shutdown around the 4th of July holiday. I think manufacturers are taking advantage of any slowdown in a holiday to cut a little bit of their own costs and pull back on some costs there. And then obviously, we had a CrowdStrike outage that began late last week, and that's impacted many, many businesses. We were down for a brief part of the day, and Naveen and the teams around the world did an outstanding job of bringing us back up very quickly. So while we've taken care of our own house, part of the impact of that will continue to be how our customers and down the chain feel that impact across their businesses. So, look, I wouldn't compare April and July just yet. As I said, July is not over, but April certainly was a tough month. And I think the thing that is a challenge for us is just all these different pieces of noise create some lack of clarity into the true trend. Back to Christian's question a minute ago, how do you parse some of this out? And I think these are the things that we're looking at, but I feel good about where we are and all the work we're doing. Hi, Henry, thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year. We've talked about some things already with Greg's question around the start to July. So we do have some things that we're managing through here in the month. I won't give quarterly guidance, but as we frame the rest of the year, Will talked about easing top line comps. But when we look at the third quarter specifically, to your point, we will continue to see deleverage in the business for many of those factors and the combination of a lower sales outlook for the rest of the year. Given that, I would tell you that we expect Q3 earnings to be down year-over-year, mostly because we see a lot of this persisting, particularly coming out of the second quarter and particularly with the softness on the industrial side of the house. With that, we would see Q4 being a little stronger on a relative basis. But as you know, there's plenty of things to think about in the fourth quarter with holidays and the weather. So I would just say, look, we've got an elevated degree of uncertainty in how we're forecasting from earlier in the year, particularly on the trends in industrial. But we're giving you all the information we have right now, everything we think, including all the other variables that are out there, with interest rates and elections and all of that are reflected in our guide. I think so, Henry. I mean I think that's a fair proxy. I mean, obviously, it will flux in any given year, a little higher maybe in a year where we do something like KDG. But I think if you're using that for a modeling point, I think it's a fair enough proxy, particularly when you look back over the history of GPC over many years. So let's just leave it there and you guys keep using that number as a reasonable proxy. Yeah. Look, Seth, I would tell you that we don't have a stated goal at this point. We're just in the early innings of this pivot. We've made some nice progress here in the second quarter. That move up to 30% came on the back of the acquisition of our largest independent owner. And we're going to continue to be opportunistic as we look at these. We obviously are trying to focus on target markets. I would tell you those lean a little bit more towards urban areas. The independent owner will continue to be an important part of our ecosystem. We have tremendously strong independent owners. They provide us strength in key markets, particularly in rural markets. They have deep relationships. We have great scale and good capabilities with all of them. And so we'll continue to have that hybrid. As we think about the March forward, I think we'll be more acquisitive as we move through the course of this year. But that will be based on the timing of these individual discussions. It's a willing buyer and a willing seller. And we've had some good luck here, bought a great business with MPEC, but it's not a one-size-fits-all, and we'll continue to let that go and come to us as it does. Yeah. We said that number was right around 30 basis points. So of the 50 basis points improvement in gross margin, all acquisitions contributed about 30 basis points. I didn't parse out the improvement for the rest of the year. We lifted the guidance for gross margin, primarily on the back of some of that goodness. So I'll let you guys kind of parse that out, how you want, but we're not being quite that specific in terms of how we thought about it. We know there'll be more benefit coming out of gross margin because of acquisitions, but also because of the great work we're doing across the business. No, Carolina, I think as we modernize DCs, it's actually probably one in which we optimize inventory, not have to stock and add more. I'll just give you an example of some of the big projects where when we look at an Australian DC consolidation of other satellite facilities around it into one, same thing happening with two different projects in Europe. And so actually, what we're seeing is it gives us a chance to be a little bit smarter and probably not have to be quite as broad in different locations and concentrated into one and maybe even get a little bit deeper in terms of what we're doing. They obviously have been designed and put in locations where they shorten stem times and lead times to get to the distribution network on the ground. That's helpful as well. So I don't think modernization of supply chain is a net negative for the inventory side of the balance sheet. I think it's actually a long-term net positive particularly when you combine it with some of the other things we're doing with service. And then if you look at the Motion side of the house, what they're doing with the fulfillment centers we've talked about in the past as well."

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Now let me turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Donahue: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report our first quarter results for Genuine Parts Company and we are encouraged by the start to 2024, particularly when compared to our strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. Our results in the quarter reflect and highlight the value of our business mix paired with our geographic diversity. Our teams delivered results that exceeded our expectations while they stayed laser-focused on our strategic initiatives to enhance our businesses and drive profitable growth. This strong start to the year, along with the continued execution of our initiatives, gives us confidence to raise our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2024. Bert will provide additional details in his remarks. A few highlights of the first quarter include: Total GPC sales of $5.8 billion increased slightly versus the same period in the prior year, which produced nearly double-digit growth; total company segment margin increased 30 basis points as continued operating discipline at motion and solid momentum in the actions implemented at our U.S. Auto business improved our profitability; and lastly, we delivered mid-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth from the same period last year. As we look to the broader macroeconomic environment, the start to 2024 continues to present a mix of challenges and opportunities. Higher interest rates and persistent cost inflation are pressuring businesses and consumers alike. Fortunately, our businesses enjoy supportive industry fundamentals, providing a positive backdrop for growth. Within our Global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in the number of miles driven, the fleet continues to age, and new and used car pricing remains elevated, particularly with financing costs. On the industrial side of our business, we have recently begun to see positive movement with key industry metrics. This further supports our positive outlook for Motion business for the balance of the year. Our Motion business benefits from a highly diverse portfolio of customers and end markets. Motion serves nearly all aspects of the industrial and manufacturing economy and is not over-indexed to any one end market or customer. In addition, we continue to expand into new areas of opportunities such as semiconductor technology. Longer-term trends around resurrect present a significant opportunity for Motion and the team is well-positioned to capitalize on those as they materialize. As we expected, sales were challenged in the first quarter as the team posted a slight year-over-year sales decline. Despite the more challenging top-line environment, the Motion team delivered exceptional profit conversion. We are pleased with the progress with our supply chain initiatives and enhanced data analytics, which are driving inventory productivity, lower cost and higher customer service levels. We expect Motion's business to accelerate through the year, particularly in the second-half of 2024. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the promotion of James Howe to President of Motion North America. James has nearly three decades of service to the company and most recently served as EVP and Chief Commercial and Technology Officer. His leadership in overseeing e-commerce, strategic pricing, sales excellence and corporate accounts has been instrumental in driving the company's recent success. James is supported by a deep bench of talent both in the field and amongst its leadership team. Last week we had the chance to visit our Motion team at their Birmingham headquarters and tour their new learning development center. This is a great example of investing for future success as we provide intensive training for both our customers, as well as our technical field teams. So now moving on to Automotive. Our teams in Europe and Australasia continue to perform well and grow market share. In addition, our team in the U.S. demonstrated solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in both sales and profit after a challenging 2023. The improvement was driven by the continued progress on the decisive actions we took at U.S. Auto over the past several quarters. We're really proud of our leadership team for their focus and execution and are confident they'll continue to drive sequential improvements as we progress through 2024. Looking ahead, we believe the GPC team is well positioned with the right strategic plans, supportive fundamentals and a strong balance sheet to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. Our results in the first quarter reflect the progress our teams around the globe are making on our key investment pillars and believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our team\u2019s relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our shareholders both now and for years to come. So, in closing, we thank each of our over 60,000 GPC teammates around the globe for taking great care of our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will?\nWill Stengel: Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC teams for their ongoing dedication to taking care of our customers. We're pleased with the solid start to the year and our first quarter performance. We truly appreciate your hard work and commitment. As always, we're aligned with global strategic initiatives centered on five key priorities including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, complemented by disciplined and value-creating acquisitions. Our global focus around these priorities drives efficiency and pace as we work to continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Now, turning to our first quarter results. During the first quarter, total sales for global industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 2%, with comparable sales down 2.6% versus the same period last year. These results were in line with our expectations as we were up against our most difficult comparative period of the year with first quarter 2023 sales up 12%. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were flat to slightly down in all three months with January seeing the most pressure, partially driven by a negative impact from severe winter weather that caused some customer facilities to close. Motion continues to see mixed results across our various served industrial end markets with strength during the quarter in iron and steel, as well as chemicals and automotive. Equipment and machinery and lumber and building products were softer in the quarter relative to the average end market. We continue to receive mixed and cautious feedback from our diversified customer base. However, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. Current renewal rates for corporate accounts, which represents approximately 45% of the business, remain at historically high levels, which further validates the current strength of the Motion value proposition. We're seeing outsized growth in our offering to physically locate Motion teammates at customers' facilities to enable an even closer partnership. Motion's highly technical sales expertise and solution-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep our customers' operations moving every day. Over the past 16-months, manufacturing PMI readings have experienced the longest period of contraction as represented by a PMI index below 50 since the financial crisis in 2009. Despite this, our Motion business has outperformed driven by its customer and end market diversification, business mix and strategic initiatives. Encouragingly, in March 2024, the manufacturing PMI was 50.3, representing an expansionary data point for the first time in 16-months. We obviously appreciate that one month doesn't make a trend, but we remain cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the medium-term outlook. Turning to Industrial segment profitability, which represents now 50% of GPC's total profit. In the first quarter, segment profit was $271 million, up 3% and 12.3% of sales, representing a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. The team continues to execute category management and supply chain productivity initiatives and operate with discipline to deliver operating leverage and margin expansion despite lower sales. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the first quarter increased approximately 2% with comparable store sales essentially flat. Our International Automotive businesses in Europe and Asia-Pac posted positive sales growth in local currency, while U.S. Automotive was flat and sales in Canada were down low-single-digits. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated to less than 1% and we expect this to be the case throughout the remainder of the year. Global Automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $273 million, up 3% and 7.6% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year and a meaningful sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflect strong operating discipline and a positive initial impact that we're seeing from actions taken at our U.S. Automotive business. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in this segment. Now let's turn to our Automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our Automotive team delivered another solid quarter with total sales growth of 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 1%. Our team continues to deliver growth with key accounts winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and the further rollout of NAPA private label products across the region. The ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity continues to have a positive impact and create value. In addition, during the quarter, our new national DC in France opened. This approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center represents a significant technology and automation upgrade within our local supply chain. This project is a great example of how we're investing to optimize our network to drive productivity and increase service levels to our customers. A similar project is well underway in the U.K. and we're leveraging best practices and technologies to deliver the project efficiently. In the Asia-Pac Automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to strong double-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the first quarter with retail showing relative strength. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team is executing well to simultaneously deliver growth and expand operating margins. In Canada, sales decreased approximately 1% in local currency during the first quarter with comparable sales decreasing approximately 3%. Our Canadian team continues to focus on sales growth in excess of the market, despite pressure from a more cautious consumer and an unseasonably mild winter. During the quarter, our Automotive business saw positive sales growth in line with our expectations, while our heavy vehicle business was slightly below driven by softer-than-expected market demand. In the U.S., Automotive sales were essentially flat during the first quarter with comparable sales increasing approximately 1%. This represents a notable improvement from the fourth quarter in both reported and comparable sales. The first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we moved through the quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in average daily sales growth each month. During the quarter, we also saw positive buying behaviors from our independent owners, a trend that we expect to continue over the course of the year. From a customer segment perspective, sales to commercial customers in the quarter were slightly down, while sales to Do It Yourself customers were approximately flat. For commercial, Auto Care continued to outperform while major accounts underperformed, driven by a cautious end consumer. We believe the in-flight actions across the business are delivering a positive impact and we expect the benefits to build throughout the year. Let me provide another quick update on some of the focus areas. First, we experienced further improvement in our inventory fill rates during the first quarter, and as expected, our actions significantly improved our in-stock levels in both our stores and distribution centers. Second, our in-store service levels, as measured by customer service and on-time delivery metrics improved following the improvements we experienced in the fourth quarter. Related, to start the second quarter of 2024, we realigned certain field teams to help focus the field on key activities, deliver excellent customer service and generate sales growth. Our elevated focus on the stores and the field operations is having a measurable positive impact on our teammates. The team is energized and we've seen a notable reduction in employee turnover year-over-year. Finally, our supply chain teams are making significant operational improvements across our network. We've enhanced processes and procedures in our operations that are driving better safety, accuracy, service levels and operational efficiency, while simultaneously reducing errors and overtime. During the quarter, we also made progress on medium-term strategic initiatives. For example, we continue to build upon our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives that are delivering results. During the quarter, our newly expanded DC and Indianapolis went live. This 600,000 square foot facility will more efficiently service hundreds of independent and company-owned stores in the U.S., utilizing new automation and enhanced technology. We also leveraged our partnership with Google to accelerate enhancements to our search and catalog that remove friction and drive a better customer experience. The feedback on these technology improvements from our customers and teams has been exceptional and we look forward to building on the momentum in the months and quarters ahead. And finally, as announced on our fourth quarter call, we're advancing our initiative to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive as we're being more intentional about owning more stores in selected priority markets. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners, who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operations at both company-owned and independently-owned locations. During the first quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 45 NAPA stores from our independent owners, an increase from the 33 NAPA stores acquired in the fourth quarter and the 16 acquired in the first quarter of last year. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We expect these trends to continue over the course of the year. Our global teams are executing on our 2024 priorities and are focused on key strategic initiatives across our business. Last quarter, we announced a coordinated global initiative across each of our operations to further simplify and streamline our operations, improve productivity, increase our speed of service and reduce our cost to serve. Our efforts are on track and Bert will go over the restructuring details in a moment. In closing, GPC started 2024 well. We delivered first quarter results that exceeded our expectations, we're cautiously optimistic about a North America industrial recovery, we're seeing encouraging traction at U.S. Automotive, we're making progress on our long-term strategic initiatives and we're confident in the revised outlook that we laid out for 2024. These results are only achieved with the hard work and dedication of each of our global teammates who take care of our customers, live our GPC values and focus to deliver performance. We remain committed to our plans for long-term growth and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.\nBert Nappier: Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our momentum from 2023 carried into the first quarter of 2024 as our teams delivered profit growth against the backdrop of low sales growth. We are pleased with the start to the year, which was ahead of our expectations, particularly as we anticipated this quarter to be the most challenging given the strong results we delivered in the first quarter of 2023. My comments this morning focus primarily on adjusted results which exclude non-recurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program. During the first quarter, we incurred approximately $83 million of costs on a pre-tax basis in line with our expectations, or $62 million after-tax related to our restructuring efforts. As we look at the first quarter, total sales were up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting a 1.9% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales and a 0.7% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our Automotive and Industrial segments in line with our expectations. Our first quarter sales performance was highlighted by the continued growth in Europe and Australasia, offset by slight declines in Industrial and Canada. Sales in our U.S. Automotive business were flat in the first quarter and our performance reflects a more than 500 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, our gross margin expanded by 100 basis points to 35.9%, primarily driven by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to be beneficial in driving positive results and our gross margin performance. Adjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 28.8% of sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 90 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. Our higher operating expenses in the first quarter reflect a negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from planned investments in IT as we continue to invest in modernized technology to run our businesses, approximately 25 basis points of negative impact from rent expense as inflationary pressures are contributing to higher costs as we renew leases, and approximately 70 basis points of negative impact from salaries and wages as we lap the final quarter of our previously announced 2023 investments in team members and absorb continued mandatory increases in minimum wages in certain international markets. These headwinds were partially offset by discipline in other discretionary categories and looking ahead, our operating expenses will benefit from the actions taken under our global restructuring program. For the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Industrial delivered 70 basis points of margin improvement, while sales declined slightly. Our margin expansion in our Industrial business is a result of ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations combined with strong expense discipline. As Will outlined earlier, the actions we've implemented to improve our U.S. Automotive business are driving benefits and we are encouraged with the margin expansion at Global Automotive and expect further improvement throughout the year. Our first quarter adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses of $62 million after tax or $0.44 per diluted share, was $311 million, or $2.22 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $304 million, or $2.14 per diluted share in 2023, an increase of 3.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the quarter, we generated $318 million in cash from operations and $203 million in free cash flow. We closed the first quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, which compares to our targeted range of two times to 2.5 times. During the first quarter, we invested $116 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures and another $135 million in the form of strategic acquisitions, including bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. to support our strategy to own more NAPA stores. In addition, we also made a small acquisition for our Motion business in North America, which expands our value-added service capabilities like fluid power and repair solutions. In the first quarter, we returned approximately $170 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $133 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and approximately $37 million in cash used to repurchase 261,000 shares. Our global restructuring efforts kicked off in the first quarter as we implement actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. We continue to expect costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million, most of which will be incurred in 2024, and we will report these as non-recurring expenses. Our restructuring efforts are expected to deliver a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. We incurred $83 million of costs in the first quarter related to our restructuring program, which can be categorized into two key areas, costs associated with our voluntary retirement program and facility optimization. Approximately 65% of the first quarter restructuring expenses were the costs associated with our voluntary retirement offer. The remaining costs are related to facility closures and start-up costs associated with new facilities that replace those that were shut down. Our first quarter restructuring activities, including the voluntary retirement offer, were completed in line with our expectations and we expect to start realizing benefits in the second quarter. Turning to our guidance. While the macroeconomic backdrop remains dynamic, industry fundamentals remain supportive and we are confident in our team's ability to drive results. With that in mind, we are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2024 and reaffirming our sales guidance. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%, with a more moderated first-half and stronger second-half for both Automotive and Industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels, contributing less than 1% for both business segments. For gross margin, we now expect full-year gross margin expansion of 30 basis points to 50 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. This compares to our previous guidance of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of gross margin expansion. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 basis points and 30 basis points, primarily from further investment in technology. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $9.05 to 9.20, compared to our previous outlook of $8.95 to $9.15. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.80 to $9.95, an increase of 5% to 6.6% from 2023. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.70 to $9.90. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. For Global Automotive segment margin, we continue to expect 20 basis points to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate global industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities: capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we will remain disciplined in evaluating opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around stores at our U.S. Automotive business. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth and strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. Overall, we are pleased and encouraged with our first quarter results as our teams continue to remain agile and deliver in this dynamic environment. Our outlook for 2024 reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and the actions we are taking to better align our business. We look forward to updating you on our progress in July. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Couple of clarifications, if I may, on the U.S. Auto. Did you guys say commercial comps were down a bit and DIY was flat? And if I heard that right, I thought you said U.S. Auto comps were up slightly. Can you just help reconcile that for us?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Scot, it's Will. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So the way to think about it, when we give you our reported numbers, both reported total and comp, that's the total U.S. Automotive kind of sales environment. So our sales into our owners and then our company-owned and independent-owned sales out. And so those numbers reflect that concept. When we start digging into the deeper level of detail around customer segment, that is just sales out, both independent and company owned. So that would be the distinction between the two data points.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay, understood. And that does or doesn't include that 130 basis point drag you cited in the deck?\nBert Nappier: Yes. So Scot, on the -- that's a question for Bert, and I'll take that one. The reported number includes the 130 basis point adjustment, but the comp number does not. And maybe I'll give you a little color on the rebate itself. And look, we hate that there's anything to mention about the whole thing, but it's a new program and it's really good for the business. As a reminder, historically, these programs were managed by our suppliers, and that was handled all outside of our P&L, and it was directly between supplier and customer. The new arrangement, those are managed by the team, and that's a good thing for the business. The new arrangement, though has to be accounted for us. It's a reduction of revenue with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and no impact to gross profit. It's a better structure for us when we think about our customers. And I think it sees tangible results in some of the things that will talk about in improvements in the business, particularly with fill rates with our new suppliers. For the first quarter, as I think we noted in our earnings presentation, our total reported sales growth was negatively impacted by 130 basis points at U.S. Automotive. When we think about comp sales, it's excluded. And our approach to comp sales excludes revenue adjustments. And this new incentive is a revenue adjustment. That's the accounting for it. And therefore, we've reflected it as such and made it consistent with like items from prior years. I think the final point I'd make is the new program wasn't in the prior year, and thus we think this is a more comparable way to present it in our view. And really, if you were going to make any adjustment, it would be to the reported number that's flat. That would actually probably have been positive without the drag of the 130 basis points.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay, thanks. I'll save my follow-up questions for later. Thank you.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Scot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, first a question on Motion. You know, the down 2.6% organic, you're expecting that to accelerate pretty sharply over there -- over the balance of the year. Obviously, ISM ticks up. Can you talk about how much is your -- of the expectation on the acceleration is just the macro indicators getting better versus something senior business just -- versus just looking at the comparisons? And then within that, I know you said back-half much better in Motion. Would you expect 2Q to turn to positive or flat?\nWill Stengel: Chris, I'll start just kind of commercially. The Motion team is doing excellent work. And so I think as we think about the recovery of the sales growth, it's going to come from market. We feel like we're outperforming the market with discrete initiatives. And so as you alluded to, as that recovery happens through the balance of the year, that would be a driver of improvement. The other thing I would just tell you, in the first quarter, we did call out the commentary around weather that impacted the business. We estimate around 80 basis points of impact to the top line associated with customers that had facilities closed in Q1. We don't want to make too big a deal of that. The other thing I would call out is the Easter holiday. We had the last day -- business day of the quarter on Good Friday, and so we saw some customer order sluggishness associated with the holiday weekend. You put that -- those two together, the Easter Holiday is probably another 80 basis points. So you got about 160 basis points of negative impact to the top line. And then you marry that together with macro acceleration through the year and we feel good about the revised guide that we gave everybody. And Bert, I don't know if you got any additional color.\nBert Nappier: Yes, look, I'll just say, Chris, when we think about the guidance for the year, we raised the outlook to $9.80 to $9.95. We really raised and tightened around a solid start to the year, the progress we've seen at U.S. Automotive, little bit better than expectation first quarter results and our restructuring activities being in line with our expectations. So we're making great progress, but we've got more work to do. As you noted, our guide assumes that U.S. Automotive and Motion accelerate through the year sequentially improve. First half is still going to be a bit moderated for all the reasons we'll just outline. And the second-half, we think gets better just on the general expectation of an improvement in industrial production and easing interest rates. I don't want you guys to think we're being overly precise about the correlation of interest rates and industrial activity in the outlook. It's not terribly specific. It's more like many companies, just a general view around our forecast that easing rates will be more supportive, more robust activity on the industrial side. And we're seeing a little sign of that with March data and no cuts right now. So we're bullish on the second half and believe that the environment will get better as we move through the year.\nChris Horvers: Understood. And then two quicks ones on the margin side. So first, on the vendor incentive program, how does that roll? So if it just change, do the benefits grow as the volumes grow? So would that be an accelerating tailwind to the gross margin over the year? And on the SG&A side, you talked about the restructuring. It's going to be $100 million to $200 million in costs, and you're basically saying it's only annualizing savings, slightly less than half of that. So why wouldn't it be something, I guess, more in line with the cost to restructure versus half of that rate? Thank you.\nBert Nappier: Yes. Look, on the vendor rebate program, we see that as pretty constant. It's not something that's going to accelerate through the course of the year. So I think that one is pretty straightforward. Look, on the restructuring program, when we think about that, it's a nice opportunity for us when you take it net-net, it's got a two-year payback. We had some variability in some of our assumptions as we started the year with the voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. But the good news is we're well underway on the restructuring activities. Just to frame it again, the overall program is going to cost us about 50% of the cost being on the people side, another 30% or so on facility actions. We'll get about 70% of the benefit we've outlined from people and about 15% from facilities, and then the rest is some other categories that probably not worth going into too much detail. In the first quarter, about 65% of the cost we incurred of the $83 million came from people, with the remaining being on facility optimization around the globe. As we look at the first quarter, the voluntary retirement program is complete. Most of the retirees left on March 31, and we wish them all the best in their new chapter in their life, largely came in line with our expectations. And we'll see those benefits start to accrue in Q2 as we move through the rest of the year. In terms of sizing, Chris, we gave ourselves a range. We're not done yet. We have a lot of work left to do through the rest of the year. So we've given you a range of $100 million to $200 million to give us some variability in where that may land. The big piece of that so far has been the voluntary retirement program, which, as I said, is finished. On the benefits side, we're estimating where we're going to be based on the take rate on the VRO and then some of the additional activities that are yet to come as we move through the rest of the year. Some of those are tied to very specific go-live dates with actions around facilities and DCs and those things. And as you know, we have an estimate of those things. They can be pulled forward and they can move back. So until we get a little bit more color, given we're just into the first quarter of the year, the fact that we're off to a good start is encouraging to us, but we'd like to give ourselves a little bit of room to work within the range until we get a little bit deeper in the year. So we'll keep you -- we'll keep you guys updated on that and we'll tighten it up when we can.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks very much.\nWill Stengel: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi, my first question was on inflation. I think I heard that it was still -- it's now trending slightly positive and you think it's sort of flat going forward. Was that true for both Industrial and Auto?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Greg, it's Bert. So the inflation impact for the quarter was less than 1% for all GPC. Both segments were pretty much in line with each other. Very, very slightly positive. So when I say less than 1%, it was pretty de minimis. And our outlook for the rest of the year is for it to stay at that less than 1% level.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then I wanted to go a little deeper. I think in the prepared comments, it might have been, Will, you mentioned Auto Care outperformed and the major accounts continue to underperform. Could you sort of give us more detail around that and how you see that playing out some of the initiatives and how that could change some of those performances in coming quarters?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Greg, happy to. So Auto Care, obviously is a super important part of our commercial business and we've been incredibly intentional about making sure we're servicing that customer segment with a lot of excellence. So making sure that we've got the right sales coverage, the right economics to motivate those folks to grow and buy from us. And so we're seeing very nice traction in that part of our business, and we're encouraged by the trajectory of that. Major accounts, as we've talked about before is a pretty diverse book of business for us. It's about 15% to 20% of our commercial business. And inside that, there's four or five different flavors of accounts. We have very specific strategies for each one of those sub segments and focusing and being disciplined around making sure that our value proposition is upheld and intact. So I think as we think about the bigger national accounts, they are feeling some sluggishness from a cautious consumer. And so that's on top of the work that we're doing to make sure that we're covering the market in the major accounts and each of its segments in the right way with a lot of strategic intent. A - Will Stengel Hey, Greg. I would just add, we had the Auto Care Advisory Council in here very recently, the teams, that group is energized. We we've got a growing Auto Care base. The quality of our auto cares has never been better and that's a program now that's 18,000 members strong and growing. And our goal is just continue to capture more-and-more of their spend, which our team is doing a great job of executing. So that's a business that's been a hallmark of NAPA for many, many years. And certainly we're energized with the direction that group is going. Q - Greg Melich And if I could throw in one more. I think last year you bought in over 100 drivers, that was a real dial-up. I guess, is that -- are you continuing at that pace this year? How does that help all these initiatives to buy those folks in? A - Bert Nappier Well, look, Greg, it's Bert. We announced in Q1 or the year-end call that we were pivoting some strategy there around the independent owner model. Look, that model has been successful for many, many years and will continue to be. And both models work in our business and they'll stay in our business. We've refined the approach a little bit and we're going to lean into owning more stores where we can and see that mix shifting some over-time. And that's really around the opportunities we see in target priority markets. And so we're going to continue to accelerate the pace. We did so in the first quarter. We had 45 stores acquired from independent owners in the first quarter. That's against 33 stores in the fourth quarter and then that number in the prior year would have been 16. So we're excited about this opportunity and we think it's great for the business. It's going to allow NAPA to really control more of the transaction, the customer experience, the strategic priorities in key markets. And we think that's a real positive thing for the business. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Greg, and I'd also mention the acquisition of independent stores is not a new development for Genuine Parts Company. We've been doing that every year for as long as I've been here. As Bert mentioned, we see that accelerating in 2024, we saw it in Q1 and expect that to continue throughout the year. But our -- us buying and selling independently-owned stores is not a new phenomenon for GPC. Q - Greg Melich That's great guys, and good luck. A - Paul Donahue Thank you. A - Bert Nappier Thanks, Greg. Operator Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. Q - Henry Carr Good morning. This is Henry Carr on for Michael Lasser. I just wanted to ask, I believe you said you've been seeing more positive buying behaviors from your independent owners. What exactly is driving that? Thanks. A - Will Stengel Yes, Henry, thanks for the question. Look, I think -- I think one of the things that we've been very clear about is all these initiatives that I detailed in my prepared remarks, those are not just relevant for our business, but also our independent owners. And so we've been very thoughtful and close in our partnership, working with them to make sure that they've got the right inventory, they're running their stores and their businesses the right way operationally. And so when we say that we're doing initiatives around NAPA, it's not only company-owned stores, but also the independent owners. And I think -- I think those programs are having an effect. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Henry, I'd just -- I'd add to Will's comment. I think it's also evident of the great job our ops team is doing in improving availability and improving our overall supply chain for U.S. Auto. Q - Henry Carr Thank you very much. Operator The next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Q - Bret Jordan Hey, good morning, guys. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Bret. A - Bert Nappier Hey, Bret. Q - Bret Jordan Could you talk about, I guess regional performance for the U.S. business? And then I guess my second question would be the cadence of the quarter as far as the progression through the months.\nWill Stengel: Yes. So I'm assuming this is a U.S. Automotive question. The progression -- the progression through the quarter was sequentially improved starting January, February, March. So March was a very strong month for us. As we look at regional, we had a good quarter in the East, Mid Atlantic, West kind of outperformers. And relative to those three parts of the business, Midwest and Southern were a little bit soft. As you know, we've got five divisions. They're all about equally weighted. So nothing of note, but that's how the quarter played out.\nBret Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Company. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. [Technical Issues] business. If you could just go a little bit deeper on the regularization of the field teams that you mentioned, how broad is this? And what customer segment are you focused on with this reorg?\nPaul Donahue: Hey, Seth, can you repeat the question? You cut out on us with your -- the first part of your comment.\nSeth Basham: Sorry, within U.S. auto and the regularization of the field teams that you mentioned, how broad is this across the country and what customer segment are these field teams focused on?\nWill Stengel: Yes, Seth, it's a national program. So it's having an effect in all parts of the U.S. Automotive business. The way to think about it is, this is our first pillar around sales effectiveness. And the concept is making sure that you've got your selling resources focused on the right customers. And so in particular, as we talked about the Auto Care segment, making sure that we got the right sales coverage for our Auto Care customers and then making sure that people in the stores are appropriately resourced and focused on making sure that we're getting parts out-of-the stores efficiently. So it's just -- it's a standard play in distribution to make sure that we're optimizing selling and then you complement all that with inside sales resources for folks and make sure you got real nice sales coverage across the entire customer-base. So it's a broad program, very common and excited about what it's going to do for the business?\nSeth Basham: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a little bit more color around the changes in sales incentives. Are there changes for the independents that could be pulling forward any sales in the last couple of months?\nPaul Donahue: We haven't made any meaningful changes to sales incentives for our sellers. We're obviously doing category management work each and every day. That's a cousin of strategic marketing. So thinking about promotion activity. And there's nothing new or different there in the first quarter unlike any other previous year. So we wouldn't expect a pull-forward.\nSeth Basham: Thanks, Paul, and good luck.\nPaul Donahue: Thanks, Seth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aaron Reed with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nAaron Reed: Yes, thanks for taking my call. I just want to touch on real quick. Inflation seems to be slowing. It sounds like you had it down 1%. Can you give a little more insight around what does wage inflation look like? Are you seeing that fall as well too or kind of where are you in that process?\nBert Nappier: Yes, Aaron, it's Bert. Look, I mean, I think when we think about the period from a year-ago with wages and some of the competition around labor, the environment certainly has abated and gotten much softer year-over-year. We're seeing in terms of how we think about labor more in-line with historical averages in terms of increases, some of the things we were having to do to invest a little bit more a year-ago have abated and we're not seeing those. So I would say year-over-year much more normalized environment and we've got that reflected in our outlook for the year. Some of that headwind of investment that we made last year, we saw impact the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And some of those things where we were investing in our team members with a little higher wage increase and healthcare increases that we didn't pass on last year, well, we're seeing that pass by. And so I would just say that when we look at labor moving forward, a less intense and competitive landscape, easier ability to recruit and gain talent in a more normalized environment for wage increases.\nAaron Reed: Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up question. Something I've been actually looking at closely as well too is your own brand expansion across Europe. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on that and really how that's progressing?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, happy to, Aaron. The -- look, the launch of the NAPA brand which occurred about four years ago, we started in the U.K., we anticipated it would be well received in the UK markets. It exceeded our expectations and actually accelerated our strategy to expand the brand across Europe. And I would tell you, Aaron, we have and continue to be very bullish on the reception the NAPA brand has received across Europe. We rolled -- we're in the process of rolling out in Spain now as we -- as we speak. And we expect that this year we'll cross the $500 million mark in outbound sales of the NAPA brand and we've done that in five years. So it's gone amazingly well.\nAaron Reed: Great. Thank you very much.\nPaul Donahue: You're welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Your next question comes from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please go ahead.\nCarolina Jolly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I know you talked about the automotive cadence. I was wondering if you could touch anything on maybe industrial and anything you can talk about in terms of cadence there and any end-markets that might have done well in the quarter?\nPaul Donahue: Yes, Carolina, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about that. The -- from the end-markets perspective, given some of the noise that I described with the weather and the March Good Friday, I'm not sure I would over-index or extrapolate some of the comments that I'll share with you. If you remember last call, we shared a little bit more detail about our 14 end-markets that we track and we saw kind of sequential improvement versus the prior quarter in two of those. We saw a little bit of step back in the sequential improvement. So we actually had three or four go the other way this quarter. Again, I wouldn't read too much into that. The short strokes are it's a mixed story out there. I commented a little bit about some of the areas of strength and weakness in terms of the types of categories. But through the quarter, we saw basically a mixed quarter, largely again driven by some of that weather. The January month was a little bit unusual and then March was a little bit unusual based on the Good Friday.\nWill Stengel: Hey, Carolina, thank you for the question. I would comment as well on the end-markets that you mentioned. Iron and steel performed very well. We also saw a good strength out of the automotive sector in the quarter. Chemicals was strong, mining was strong. So we saw a good balance across a number of end-markets, which really gives us good optimism, especially when you combine it with the positive PMI number that came across in March, it certainly gives us good optimism about our Motion business in the -- in the remaining quarters of the year. So all good on that front, and thank you again for the question.\nCarolina Jolly: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Will Stengel",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by adding my thanks to the global GPC teams for their ongoing dedication to taking care of our customers. We're pleased with the solid start to the year and our first quarter performance. We truly appreciate your hard work and commitment. As always, we're aligned with global strategic initiatives centered on five key priorities including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, complemented by disciplined and value-creating acquisitions. Our global focus around these priorities drives efficiency and pace as we work to continuously improve the customer experience and deliver profitable growth. Now, turning to our first quarter results. During the first quarter, total sales for global industrial were $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 2%, with comparable sales down 2.6% versus the same period last year. These results were in line with our expectations as we were up against our most difficult comparative period of the year with first quarter 2023 sales up 12%. From a cadence perspective, average daily sales were flat to slightly down in all three months with January seeing the most pressure, partially driven by a negative impact from severe winter weather that caused some customer facilities to close. Motion continues to see mixed results across our various served industrial end markets with strength during the quarter in iron and steel, as well as chemicals and automotive. Equipment and machinery and lumber and building products were softer in the quarter relative to the average end market. We continue to receive mixed and cautious feedback from our diversified customer base. However, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. Current renewal rates for corporate accounts, which represents approximately 45% of the business, remain at historically high levels, which further validates the current strength of the Motion value proposition. We're seeing outsized growth in our offering to physically locate Motion teammates at customers' facilities to enable an even closer partnership. Motion's highly technical sales expertise and solution-based selling drives deep relationships with our customers and helps to keep our customers' operations moving every day. Over the past 16-months, manufacturing PMI readings have experienced the longest period of contraction as represented by a PMI index below 50 since the financial crisis in 2009. Despite this, our Motion business has outperformed driven by its customer and end market diversification, business mix and strategic initiatives. Encouragingly, in March 2024, the manufacturing PMI was 50.3, representing an expansionary data point for the first time in 16-months. We obviously appreciate that one month doesn't make a trend, but we remain cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year and the medium-term outlook. Turning to Industrial segment profitability, which represents now 50% of GPC's total profit. In the first quarter, segment profit was $271 million, up 3% and 12.3% of sales, representing a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. The team continues to execute category management and supply chain productivity initiatives and operate with discipline to deliver operating leverage and margin expansion despite lower sales. Turning to the Global Automotive segment. Sales in the first quarter increased approximately 2% with comparable store sales essentially flat. Our International Automotive businesses in Europe and Asia-Pac posted positive sales growth in local currency, while U.S. Automotive was flat and sales in Canada were down low-single-digits. As expected, Global Automotive sales inflation moderated to less than 1% and we expect this to be the case throughout the remainder of the year. Global Automotive segment profit in the first quarter was $273 million, up 3% and 7.6% of sales, representing a 10 basis point increase from the same period last year and a meaningful sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter results for Global Automotive segment reflect strong operating discipline and a positive initial impact that we're seeing from actions taken at our U.S. Automotive business. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in this segment. Now let's turn to our Automotive business performance by geography. Starting in Europe, our Automotive team delivered another solid quarter with total sales growth of 8% in local currency and comparable sales growth of 1%. Our team continues to deliver growth with key accounts winning higher share of wallet with existing accounts and the further rollout of NAPA private label products across the region. The ongoing bolt-on acquisition activity continues to have a positive impact and create value. In addition, during the quarter, our new national DC in France opened. This approximately 500,000 square foot distribution center represents a significant technology and automation upgrade within our local supply chain. This project is a great example of how we're investing to optimize our network to drive productivity and increase service levels to our customers. A similar project is well underway in the U.K. and we're leveraging best practices and technologies to deliver the project efficiently. In the Asia-Pac Automotive business, sales in the first quarter increased 2% in local currency with comparable sales growth of 1%. Similar to last quarter, this performance compares to strong double-digit growth in the same period last year. Sales for both commercial and retail were up in the first quarter with retail showing relative strength. Despite a challenging macro environment, the team is executing well to simultaneously deliver growth and expand operating margins. In Canada, sales decreased approximately 1% in local currency during the first quarter with comparable sales decreasing approximately 3%. Our Canadian team continues to focus on sales growth in excess of the market, despite pressure from a more cautious consumer and an unseasonably mild winter. During the quarter, our Automotive business saw positive sales growth in line with our expectations, while our heavy vehicle business was slightly below driven by softer-than-expected market demand. In the U.S., Automotive sales were essentially flat during the first quarter with comparable sales increasing approximately 1%. This represents a notable improvement from the fourth quarter in both reported and comparable sales. The first quarter performance was in line with our expectations. As we moved through the quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in average daily sales growth each month. During the quarter, we also saw positive buying behaviors from our independent owners, a trend that we expect to continue over the course of the year. From a customer segment perspective, sales to commercial customers in the quarter were slightly down, while sales to Do It Yourself customers were approximately flat. For commercial, Auto Care continued to outperform while major accounts underperformed, driven by a cautious end consumer. We believe the in-flight actions across the business are delivering a positive impact and we expect the benefits to build throughout the year. Let me provide another quick update on some of the focus areas. First, we experienced further improvement in our inventory fill rates during the first quarter, and as expected, our actions significantly improved our in-stock levels in both our stores and distribution centers. Second, our in-store service levels, as measured by customer service and on-time delivery metrics improved following the improvements we experienced in the fourth quarter. Related, to start the second quarter of 2024, we realigned certain field teams to help focus the field on key activities, deliver excellent customer service and generate sales growth. Our elevated focus on the stores and the field operations is having a measurable positive impact on our teammates. The team is energized and we've seen a notable reduction in employee turnover year-over-year. Finally, our supply chain teams are making significant operational improvements across our network. We've enhanced processes and procedures in our operations that are driving better safety, accuracy, service levels and operational efficiency, while simultaneously reducing errors and overtime. During the quarter, we also made progress on medium-term strategic initiatives. For example, we continue to build upon our strategic pricing and sourcing initiatives that are delivering results. During the quarter, our newly expanded DC and Indianapolis went live. This 600,000 square foot facility will more efficiently service hundreds of independent and company-owned stores in the U.S., utilizing new automation and enhanced technology. We also leveraged our partnership with Google to accelerate enhancements to our search and catalog that remove friction and drive a better customer experience. The feedback on these technology improvements from our customers and teams has been exceptional and we look forward to building on the momentum in the months and quarters ahead. And finally, as announced on our fourth quarter call, we're advancing our initiative to evolve our operating model at U.S. Automotive as we're being more intentional about owning more stores in selected priority markets. In parallel, we continue to partner with our existing network of independent owners, who play an important role to help us serve our local markets. Our current in-flight initiatives are designed to improve growth and operations at both company-owned and independently-owned locations. During the first quarter, we made strategic acquisitions of 45 NAPA stores from our independent owners, an increase from the 33 NAPA stores acquired in the fourth quarter and the 16 acquired in the first quarter of last year. We're leveraging our disciplined integration playbook as we integrate these stores into our own store base. We expect these trends to continue over the course of the year. Our global teams are executing on our 2024 priorities and are focused on key strategic initiatives across our business. Last quarter, we announced a coordinated global initiative across each of our operations to further simplify and streamline our operations, improve productivity, increase our speed of service and reduce our cost to serve. Our efforts are on track and Bert will go over the restructuring details in a moment. In closing, GPC started 2024 well. We delivered first quarter results that exceeded our expectations, we're cautiously optimistic about a North America industrial recovery, we're seeing encouraging traction at U.S. Automotive, we're making progress on our long-term strategic initiatives and we're confident in the revised outlook that we laid out for 2024. These results are only achieved with the hard work and dedication of each of our global teammates who take care of our customers, live our GPC values and focus to deliver performance. We remain committed to our plans for long-term growth and we're confident our teams are focused on the right strategic initiatives that will deliver solutions for our customers and create value. Thank you again to the entire GPC team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bert. Yes, Scot, it's Will. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So the way to think about it, when we give you our reported numbers, both reported total and comp, that's the total U.S. Automotive kind of sales environment. So our sales into our owners and then our company-owned and independent-owned sales out. And so those numbers reflect that concept. When we start digging into the deeper level of detail around customer segment, that is just sales out, both independent and company owned. So that would be the distinction between the two data points. Thanks, Scot. Chris, I'll start just kind of commercially. The Motion team is doing excellent work. And so I think as we think about the recovery of the sales growth, it's going to come from market. We feel like we're outperforming the market with discrete initiatives. And so as you alluded to, as that recovery happens through the balance of the year, that would be a driver of improvement. The other thing I would just tell you, in the first quarter, we did call out the commentary around weather that impacted the business. We estimate around 80 basis points of impact to the top line associated with customers that had facilities closed in Q1. We don't want to make too big a deal of that. The other thing I would call out is the Easter holiday. We had the last day -- business day of the quarter on Good Friday, and so we saw some customer order sluggishness associated with the holiday weekend. You put that -- those two together, the Easter Holiday is probably another 80 basis points. So you got about 160 basis points of negative impact to the top line. And then you marry that together with macro acceleration through the year and we feel good about the revised guide that we gave everybody. And Bert, I don't know if you got any additional color. Thanks, Chris. Yes, Greg, happy to. So Auto Care, obviously is a super important part of our commercial business and we've been incredibly intentional about making sure we're servicing that customer segment with a lot of excellence. So making sure that we've got the right sales coverage, the right economics to motivate those folks to grow and buy from us. And so we're seeing very nice traction in that part of our business, and we're encouraged by the trajectory of that. Major accounts, as we've talked about before is a pretty diverse book of business for us. It's about 15% to 20% of our commercial business. And inside that, there's four or five different flavors of accounts. We have very specific strategies for each one of those sub segments and focusing and being disciplined around making sure that our value proposition is upheld and intact. So I think as we think about the bigger national accounts, they are feeling some sluggishness from a cautious consumer. And so that's on top of the work that we're doing to make sure that we're covering the market in the major accounts and each of its segments in the right way with a lot of strategic intent. A - Will Stengel Hey, Greg. I would just add, we had the Auto Care Advisory Council in here very recently, the teams, that group is energized. We we've got a growing Auto Care base. The quality of our auto cares has never been better and that's a program now that's 18,000 members strong and growing. And our goal is just continue to capture more-and-more of their spend, which our team is doing a great job of executing. So that's a business that's been a hallmark of NAPA for many, many years. And certainly we're energized with the direction that group is going. Q - Greg Melich And if I could throw in one more. I think last year you bought in over 100 drivers, that was a real dial-up. I guess, is that -- are you continuing at that pace this year? How does that help all these initiatives to buy those folks in? A - Bert Nappier Well, look, Greg, it's Bert. We announced in Q1 or the year-end call that we were pivoting some strategy there around the independent owner model. Look, that model has been successful for many, many years and will continue to be. And both models work in our business and they'll stay in our business. We've refined the approach a little bit and we're going to lean into owning more stores where we can and see that mix shifting some over-time. And that's really around the opportunities we see in target priority markets. And so we're going to continue to accelerate the pace. We did so in the first quarter. We had 45 stores acquired from independent owners in the first quarter. That's against 33 stores in the fourth quarter and then that number in the prior year would have been 16. So we're excited about this opportunity and we think it's great for the business. It's going to allow NAPA to really control more of the transaction, the customer experience, the strategic priorities in key markets. And we think that's a real positive thing for the business. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Greg, and I'd also mention the acquisition of independent stores is not a new development for Genuine Parts Company. We've been doing that every year for as long as I've been here. As Bert mentioned, we see that accelerating in 2024, we saw it in Q1 and expect that to continue throughout the year. But our -- us buying and selling independently-owned stores is not a new phenomenon for GPC. Q - Greg Melich That's great guys, and good luck. A - Paul Donahue Thank you. A - Bert Nappier Thanks, Greg. Operator Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. Q - Henry Carr Good morning. This is Henry Carr on for Michael Lasser. I just wanted to ask, I believe you said you've been seeing more positive buying behaviors from your independent owners. What exactly is driving that? Thanks. A - Will Stengel Yes, Henry, thanks for the question. Look, I think -- I think one of the things that we've been very clear about is all these initiatives that I detailed in my prepared remarks, those are not just relevant for our business, but also our independent owners. And so we've been very thoughtful and close in our partnership, working with them to make sure that they've got the right inventory, they're running their stores and their businesses the right way operationally. And so when we say that we're doing initiatives around NAPA, it's not only company-owned stores, but also the independent owners. And I think -- I think those programs are having an effect. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Henry, I'd just -- I'd add to Will's comment. I think it's also evident of the great job our ops team is doing in improving availability and improving our overall supply chain for U.S. Auto. Q - Henry Carr Thank you very much. Operator The next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Q - Bret Jordan Hey, good morning, guys. A - Paul Donahue Hey, Bret. A - Bert Nappier Hey, Bret. Q - Bret Jordan Could you talk about, I guess regional performance for the U.S. business? And then I guess my second question would be the cadence of the quarter as far as the progression through the months. Yes. So I'm assuming this is a U.S. Automotive question. The progression -- the progression through the quarter was sequentially improved starting January, February, March. So March was a very strong month for us.

I would comment as well on the end-markets that you mentioned. Iron and steel performed very well. We also saw a good strength out of the automotive sector in the quarter. Chemicals was strong, mining was strong. So we saw a good balance across a number of end-markets, which really gives us good optimism, especially when you combine it with the positive PMI number that came across in March, it certainly gives us good optimism about our Motion business in the -- in the remaining quarters of the year. So all good on that front, and thank you again for the question."

            "name": "Bert Nappier",
            "content": "Thank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our momentum from 2023 carried into the first quarter of 2024 as our teams delivered profit growth against the backdrop of low sales growth. We are pleased with the start to the year, which was ahead of our expectations, particularly as we anticipated this quarter to be the most challenging given the strong results we delivered in the first quarter of 2023. My comments this morning focus primarily on adjusted results which exclude non-recurring costs related to our previously announced global restructuring program. During the first quarter, we incurred approximately $83 million of costs on a pre-tax basis in line with our expectations, or $62 million after-tax related to our restructuring efforts. As we look at the first quarter, total sales were up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting a 1.9% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a 0.9% decrease in comparable sales and a 0.7% unfavorable impact of foreign currency and other. During the quarter, the contribution from inflation was less than 1% in both our Automotive and Industrial segments in line with our expectations. Our first quarter sales performance was highlighted by the continued growth in Europe and Australasia, offset by slight declines in Industrial and Canada. Sales in our U.S. Automotive business were flat in the first quarter and our performance reflects a more than 500 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, our gross margin expanded by 100 basis points to 35.9%, primarily driven by the ongoing execution of our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. Our investments in technology and category management capabilities are continuing to be beneficial in driving positive results and our gross margin performance. Adjusting for restructuring expenses, total adjusted operating and non-operating expenses were 28.8% of sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 90 basis points from total expenses in the prior year. Our higher operating expenses in the first quarter reflect a negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from planned investments in IT as we continue to invest in modernized technology to run our businesses, approximately 25 basis points of negative impact from rent expense as inflationary pressures are contributing to higher costs as we renew leases, and approximately 70 basis points of negative impact from salaries and wages as we lap the final quarter of our previously announced 2023 investments in team members and absorb continued mandatory increases in minimum wages in certain international markets. These headwinds were partially offset by discipline in other discretionary categories and looking ahead, our operating expenses will benefit from the actions taken under our global restructuring program. For the quarter, segment profit margin was 9.4%, a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. Industrial delivered 70 basis points of margin improvement, while sales declined slightly. Our margin expansion in our Industrial business is a result of ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our operations combined with strong expense discipline. As Will outlined earlier, the actions we've implemented to improve our U.S. Automotive business are driving benefits and we are encouraged with the margin expansion at Global Automotive and expect further improvement throughout the year. Our first quarter adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses of $62 million after tax or $0.44 per diluted share, was $311 million, or $2.22 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $304 million, or $2.14 per diluted share in 2023, an increase of 3.7%. Turning to our cash flows. For the quarter, we generated $318 million in cash from operations and $203 million in free cash flow. We closed the first quarter with $2.5 billion in available liquidity and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times, which compares to our targeted range of two times to 2.5 times. During the first quarter, we invested $116 million back into the business in the form of capital expenditures and another $135 million in the form of strategic acquisitions, including bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. to support our strategy to own more NAPA stores. In addition, we also made a small acquisition for our Motion business in North America, which expands our value-added service capabilities like fluid power and repair solutions. In the first quarter, we returned approximately $170 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $133 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and approximately $37 million in cash used to repurchase 261,000 shares. Our global restructuring efforts kicked off in the first quarter as we implement actions to position us to achieve our long-term targets. We continue to expect costs of approximately $100 million to $200 million, most of which will be incurred in 2024, and we will report these as non-recurring expenses. Our restructuring efforts are expected to deliver a benefit of $20 million to $40 million in 2024 and $45 million to $90 million on an annualized basis. We incurred $83 million of costs in the first quarter related to our restructuring program, which can be categorized into two key areas, costs associated with our voluntary retirement program and facility optimization. Approximately 65% of the first quarter restructuring expenses were the costs associated with our voluntary retirement offer. The remaining costs are related to facility closures and start-up costs associated with new facilities that replace those that were shut down. Our first quarter restructuring activities, including the voluntary retirement offer, were completed in line with our expectations and we expect to start realizing benefits in the second quarter. Turning to our guidance. While the macroeconomic backdrop remains dynamic, industry fundamentals remain supportive and we are confident in our team's ability to drive results. With that in mind, we are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2024 and reaffirming our sales guidance. For the year, we expect total sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%, with a more moderated first-half and stronger second-half for both Automotive and Industrial. Included in our outlook is the assumption that the benefit from inflation remains at more normalized levels, contributing less than 1% for both business segments. For gross margin, we now expect full-year gross margin expansion of 30 basis points to 50 basis points, primarily driven by our continued focus on our strategic sourcing and pricing initiatives. This compares to our previous guidance of 20 basis points to 40 basis points of gross margin expansion. Our outlook assumes that SG&A will deleverage between 20 basis points and 30 basis points, primarily from further investment in technology. We now expect the diluted earnings per share, which includes the expenses related to our restructuring efforts, will be in the range of $9.05 to 9.20, compared to our previous outlook of $8.95 to $9.15. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.80 to $9.95, an increase of 5% to 6.6% from 2023. This compares to our previous outlook of $9.70 to $9.90. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 2% to 4% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth in the 1% to 3% range. For Global Automotive segment margin, we continue to expect 20 basis points to 40 basis points of expansion year-over-year. For the Industrial segment, we expect total sales growth of 3% to 5% with comparable sales growth in the 2% to 4% range. For 2024, we anticipate global industrial segment margin to expand by approximately 10 basis points to 20 basis points year-over-year. And finally, we are targeting corporate expense to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of sales. Turning to a few other items of interest. We are confident in the strength of our cash flows in 2024 and continue to expect cash from operations to be in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with free cash flow of $800 million to $1 billion. In 2024, we will continue our long history of balanced capital allocation with four priorities: capital expenditures, M&A, our dividend and share repurchases. For CapEx, we continue to expect approximately $500 million or 2% of revenue. As we look at 2024, the growth capital we are deploying, which is approximately 55% of our forecast, will drive modernization of our supply chain, including new DCs partnered with technology that enhances our customer experience. As we look at M&A, our global pipeline remains robust and we will remain disciplined in evaluating opportunities that create value, including continuing to pursue our strategy around stores at our U.S. Automotive business. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that fit with our long-term growth and strategies regardless of the economic backdrop. Overall, we are pleased and encouraged with our first quarter results as our teams continue to remain agile and deliver in this dynamic environment. Our outlook for 2024 reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and the actions we are taking to better align our business. We look forward to updating you on our progress in July. Thank you. And we will now turn it back to the operator for your questions. Yes. So Scot, on the -- that's a question for Bert, and I'll take that one. The reported number includes the 130 basis point adjustment, but the comp number does not. And maybe I'll give you a little color on the rebate itself. And look, we hate that there's anything to mention about the whole thing, but it's a new program and it's really good for the business. As a reminder, historically, these programs were managed by our suppliers, and that was handled all outside of our P&L, and it was directly between supplier and customer. The new arrangement, those are managed by the team, and that's a good thing for the business. The new arrangement, though has to be accounted for us. It's a reduction of revenue with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold and no impact to gross profit. It's a better structure for us when we think about our customers. And I think it sees tangible results in some of the things that will talk about in improvements in the business, particularly with fill rates with our new suppliers. For the first quarter, as I think we noted in our earnings presentation, our total reported sales growth was negatively impacted by 130 basis points at U.S. Automotive. When we think about comp sales, it's excluded. And our approach to comp sales excludes revenue adjustments. And this new incentive is a revenue adjustment. That's the accounting for it. And therefore, we've reflected it as such and made it consistent with like items from prior years. I think the final point I'd make is the new program wasn't in the prior year, and thus we think this is a more comparable way to present it in our view. And really, if you were going to make any adjustment, it would be to the reported number that's flat. That would actually probably have been positive without the drag of the 130 basis points. Yes, look, I'll just say, Chris, when we think about the guidance for the year, we raised the outlook to $9.80 to $9.95. We really raised and tightened around a solid start to the year, the progress we've seen at U.S. Automotive, little bit better than expectation first quarter results and our restructuring activities being in line with our expectations. So we're making great progress, but we've got more work to do. As you noted, our guide assumes that U.S. Automotive and Motion accelerate through the year sequentially improve. First half is still going to be a bit moderated for all the reasons we'll just outline. And the second-half, we think gets better just on the general expectation of an improvement in industrial production and easing interest rates. I don't want you guys to think we're being overly precise about the correlation of interest rates and industrial activity in the outlook. It's not terribly specific. It's more like many companies, just a general view around our forecast that easing rates will be more supportive, more robust activity on the industrial side. And we're seeing a little sign of that with March data and no cuts right now. So we're bullish on the second half and believe that the environment will get better as we move through the year. Yes. Look, on the vendor rebate program, we see that as pretty constant. It's not something that's going to accelerate through the course of the year. So I think that one is pretty straightforward. Look, on the restructuring program, when we think about that, it's a nice opportunity for us when you take it net-net, it's got a two-year payback. We had some variability in some of our assumptions as we started the year with the voluntary retirement program here in the U.S. But the good news is we're well underway on the restructuring activities. Just to frame it again, the overall program is going to cost us about 50% of the cost being on the people side, another 30% or so on facility actions. We'll get about 70% of the benefit we've outlined from people and about 15% from facilities, and then the rest is some other categories that probably not worth going into too much detail. In the first quarter, about 65% of the cost we incurred of the $83 million came from people, with the remaining being on facility optimization around the globe. As we look at the first quarter, the voluntary retirement program is complete. Most of the retirees left on March 31, and we wish them all the best in their new chapter in their life, largely came in line with our expectations. And we'll see those benefits start to accrue in Q2 as we move through the rest of the year. In terms of sizing, Chris, we gave ourselves a range. We're not done yet. We have a lot of work left to do through the rest of the year. So we've given you a range of $100 million to $200 million to give us some variability in where that may land. The big piece of that so far has been the voluntary retirement program, which, as I said, is finished. On the benefits side, we're estimating where we're going to be based on the take rate on the VRO and then some of the additional activities that are yet to come as we move through the rest of the year. Some of those are tied to very specific go-live dates with actions around facilities and DCs and those things. And as you know, we have an estimate of those things. They can be pulled forward and they can move back. So until we get a little bit more color, given we're just into the first quarter of the year, the fact that we're off to a good start is encouraging to us, but we'd like to give ourselves a little bit of room to work within the range until we get a little bit deeper in the year. So we'll keep you -- we'll keep you guys updated on that and we'll tighten it up when we can. Yes, Greg, it's Bert. So the inflation impact for the quarter was less than 1% for all GPC. Both segments were pretty much in line with each other. Very, very slightly positive. So when I say less than 1%, it was pretty de minimis. And our outlook for the rest of the year is for it to stay at that less than 1% level. Yes, Aaron, it's Bert. Look, I mean, I think when we think about the period from a year-ago with wages and some of the competition around labor, the environment certainly has abated and gotten much softer year-over-year. We're seeing in terms of how we think about labor more in-line with historical averages in terms of increases, some of the things we were having to do to invest a little bit more a year-ago have abated and we're not seeing those. So I would say year-over-year much more normalized environment and we've got that reflected in our outlook for the year. Some of that headwind of investment that we made last year, we saw impact the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And some of those things where we were investing in our team members with a little higher wage increase and healthcare increases that we didn't pass on last year, well, we're seeing that pass by. And so I would just say that when we look at labor moving forward, a less intense and competitive landscape, easier ability to recruit and gain talent in a more normalized environment for wage increases."

            "name": "Paul Donahue",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report our first quarter results for Genuine Parts Company and we are encouraged by the start to 2024, particularly when compared to our strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. Our results in the quarter reflect and highlight the value of our business mix paired with our geographic diversity. Our teams delivered results that exceeded our expectations while they stayed laser-focused on our strategic initiatives to enhance our businesses and drive profitable growth. This strong start to the year, along with the continued execution of our initiatives, gives us confidence to raise our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2024. Bert will provide additional details in his remarks. A few highlights of the first quarter include: Total GPC sales of $5.8 billion increased slightly versus the same period in the prior year, which produced nearly double-digit growth; total company segment margin increased 30 basis points as continued operating discipline at motion and solid momentum in the actions implemented at our U.S. Auto business improved our profitability; and lastly, we delivered mid-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth from the same period last year. As we look to the broader macroeconomic environment, the start to 2024 continues to present a mix of challenges and opportunities. Higher interest rates and persistent cost inflation are pressuring businesses and consumers alike. Fortunately, our businesses enjoy supportive industry fundamentals, providing a positive backdrop for growth. Within our Global Automotive business, we continue to see an increase in the number of miles driven, the fleet continues to age, and new and used car pricing remains elevated, particularly with financing costs. On the industrial side of our business, we have recently begun to see positive movement with key industry metrics. This further supports our positive outlook for Motion business for the balance of the year. Our Motion business benefits from a highly diverse portfolio of customers and end markets. Motion serves nearly all aspects of the industrial and manufacturing economy and is not over-indexed to any one end market or customer. In addition, we continue to expand into new areas of opportunities such as semiconductor technology. Longer-term trends around resurrect present a significant opportunity for Motion and the team is well-positioned to capitalize on those as they materialize. As we expected, sales were challenged in the first quarter as the team posted a slight year-over-year sales decline. Despite the more challenging top-line environment, the Motion team delivered exceptional profit conversion. We are pleased with the progress with our supply chain initiatives and enhanced data analytics, which are driving inventory productivity, lower cost and higher customer service levels. We expect Motion's business to accelerate through the year, particularly in the second-half of 2024. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce the promotion of James Howe to President of Motion North America. James has nearly three decades of service to the company and most recently served as EVP and Chief Commercial and Technology Officer. His leadership in overseeing e-commerce, strategic pricing, sales excellence and corporate accounts has been instrumental in driving the company's recent success. James is supported by a deep bench of talent both in the field and amongst its leadership team. Last week we had the chance to visit our Motion team at their Birmingham headquarters and tour their new learning development center. This is a great example of investing for future success as we provide intensive training for both our customers, as well as our technical field teams. So now moving on to Automotive. Our teams in Europe and Australasia continue to perform well and grow market share. In addition, our team in the U.S. demonstrated solid sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in both sales and profit after a challenging 2023. The improvement was driven by the continued progress on the decisive actions we took at U.S. Auto over the past several quarters. We're really proud of our leadership team for their focus and execution and are confident they'll continue to drive sequential improvements as we progress through 2024. Looking ahead, we believe the GPC team is well positioned with the right strategic plans, supportive fundamentals and a strong balance sheet to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, while also returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases. Our results in the first quarter reflect the progress our teams around the globe are making on our key investment pillars and believe the execution of our strategic initiatives, along with our team's relentless focus on our customers, will drive value for our shareholders both now and for years to come. So, in closing, we thank each of our over 60,000 GPC teammates around the globe for taking great care of our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will. Will? Hey, Seth, can you repeat the question? You cut out on us with your -- the first part of your comment. We haven't made any meaningful changes to sales incentives for our sellers. We're obviously doing category management work each and every day. That's a cousin of strategic marketing. So thinking about promotion activity. And there's nothing new or different there in the first quarter unlike any other previous year. So we wouldn't expect a pull-forward. Thanks, Seth. Yes, happy to, Aaron. The -- look, the launch of the NAPA brand which occurred about four years ago, we started in the U.K., we anticipated it would be well received in the UK markets. It exceeded our expectations and actually accelerated our strategy to expand the brand across Europe. And I would tell you, Aaron, we have and continue to be very bullish on the reception the NAPA brand has received across Europe. We rolled -- we're in the process of rolling out in Spain now as we -- as we speak. And we expect that this year we'll cross the $500 million mark in outbound sales of the NAPA brand and we've done that in five years. So it's gone amazingly well. You're welcome. Yes, Carolina, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about that. The -- from the end-markets perspective, given some of the noise that I described with the weather and the March Good Friday, I'm not sure I would over-index or extrapolate some of the comments that I'll share with you. If you remember last call, we shared a little bit more detail about our 14 end-markets that we track and we saw kind of sequential improvement versus the prior quarter in two of those. We saw a little bit of step back in the sequential improvement. So we actually had three or four go the other way this quarter. Again, I wouldn't read too much into that. The short strokes are it's a mixed story out there. I commented a little bit about some of the areas of strength and weakness in terms of the types of categories. But through the quarter, we saw basically a mixed quarter, largely again driven by some of that weather. The January month was a little bit unusual and then March was a little bit unusual based on the Good Friday."
