At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Lisa Banks, SVP of Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nLisa Banks: Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for ServiceNow's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the first quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of January 27, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly including, but not limited to, the timeframes for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decision and the length of our sales cycles particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K that will be filed for fiscal year 2020. For information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or CRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and our investor presentation and for prior quarters' previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Having confronted an unprecedented global environment, we are looking ahead with optimism and are thankful to be so well positioned to serve our customers. Needless to say, we delivered a market-leading 2020. We significantly beat expectations across the board, bringing great momentum into the New Year. I could not be proud of our team's execution. We delivered over 30% organic top line growth, 25% operating margins, and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, just an outstanding performance and a testament to our ServiceNow strong culture. Throughout the year, we led with courage and conviction. We took care of our team, our customers and our communities. And most importantly, we led with ServiceNow's purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. We strive to see the world through our customers' eyes with empathy to address their needs. The workflow revolution is happening and the pandemic is accelerating digital transformation. Every business needs speed, agility and resilience. And every C-suite leader wants to deliver great experiences for their employees and their customers. Businesses are changing the way they operate. They need to deliver fierce customer loyalty and deep employee engagement to win. It's all about people, empathy at mass scale is the business imperative of the 21 century. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovations have all intersected at the perfect moment in time, a paradigm here is happening worldwide. In 2020, for the first time in history, we saw a digital transformation spending accelerate despite GDP declining globally. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing. According to IDC, worldwide digital transformation investments will total more than $7.4 trillion by 2024. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders. ServiceNow is the platform company for digital business. The Now Platform, what I call the platform of platforms offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. Our simple low-code app development enables fast workflows to solve any business challenge, delivering consumer-grade digital experiences. The Now Platform enables easier and faster implementation, delivering unbeatable time to value and fast ROI. That's the beauty of the Now Platform, one platform, one data model and one architecture. We seamlessly integrated all of this and through our system and that system integrate seamlessly with all systems of record that matter most to our customers. We deliver workflows through their preferred collaboration platform as well. We give our customers the freedom of choice to use their preferred tools and the unique ability to build apps at record speed. Hungry and humble is a core ServiceNow value, it\u2019s proven now than ever. We are grateful to be in such a strong position at such a pivotal moment and we are hungry. We are eager to use our strengths to help our customers succeed, help make our community stronger and help create great experiences for people. We are seeing an extraordinary expansion of use cases in our business. Healthcare organizations are using ServiceNow to improve operations and service delivery, which means better outcomes for people. St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital has been on a journey to accelerate progress towards finding cures and saving children. In 2020, COVID-19 created a significant headwind to that mission. With much of the hospital staff required to work-from-home, the need to digitize manual workflows became more important than ever. The hospital leveraged ServiceNow\u2019s low-code App Engine and IntegrationHub to integrate disparate systems and build custom end-to-end workflows, ultimately allowing them to ensure seamless delivery of clinical services. In under four weeks, the ServiceNow solution was implemented at St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital and everybody was moving toward their goal. We\u2019re also proud to be supporting NHS Scotland and their efforts to vaccinate 5.5 million citizens. NHS Scotland is using the Now Platform and our customer workflow to deploy a customized solution designed to meet their specific needs. Deployment took only six weeks, showing the agility of the Now Platform. ServiceNow is enabling a comprehensive solution for the scheduling and reporting of vaccination for Scotland\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. Within 12 hours of roll-out, NHS Scotland booked over 220,000 appointments. So as you can see, it\u2019s not just about business workflows, it\u2019s about real people. Enterprise digital transformation is how every organization in every sector in every geo are adapting, growing, creating new business models and empowering their people to be productive in any environment under any condition. That\u2019s modern, agile, resilient business at work and it\u2019s being powered by the Now Platform. Our unique platform and innovative product suite, our strong brand, high customer satisfaction and compelling value proposition are the differentiating factors and competitive advantages fueling our performance. Our Q4 results are testament. We dreamed big and delivered. We grew billings by more than 40% year-over-year organically. We delivered 89 deals greater than $1 million and now have close to 1,100 customers paying us over $1 million annually. We landed our largest deal ever, surpassing the deal record we set in Q3 with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Deal sizes overall keep getting larger. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 99%. Here are some key customer wins from Q4. We signed a multi-year and multi-product strategic deal with AT&T. They are transforming by focusing on broadband connectivity, 5G and software-based entertainment, while relentlessly focusing on digital, consumer preferences and experiences. We\u2019re delighted to work with AT&T Communications in its transformation. ServiceNow\u2019s AI-powered platform and service operations product lines will provide AT&T accurate and real-time operational visibility into every layer of the network fabric and help deliver the best-in-class customer experience, better experiences for people enabled by ServiceNow. One of the UK\u2019s big four banks is using multiple ServiceNow products, including our purpose-built new financial services operations product to help transform the way it operates and to deliver better customer experiences. The bank has seen a 70% efficiency and improvement of payment processing by integrating the Now Platform into its core banking systems. With ServiceNow, this bank implemented new automated processes in 60 workdays. In their words, employees moved from cut and paste, swivel chair manual processes to efficient, automated workflows. In one case, employees went from managing 10 requests an hour to 1,000 requests in three minutes on the Now Platform, better experiences for people. PayPal recently expanded their relationship with ServiceNow as a key partner for elements of their digital transformation. And we\u2019re proud to have expanded our relationship with Nike, who is using the Now Platform to create better customer and employee experiences. Other Q4 deals across our portfolio represented wins with major customers in key sectors such as Booking.com in travel and hospitality, BP in energy, Santander UK and USAA in financial services and the list goes on and on. I hear so many ServiceNow success stories every day. Companies are onboarding thousands of people in a work-from-home environment, making them feel productive and part of the team from day one. Customers are going live on the Now Platform in days, not months, making a difference for people now, not next month or next year, now. More productive employees, happier customers, more efficient operations, there is not a CEO on the planet, who doesn\u2019t want that, the Now Platform delivers. These examples show how technology is no longer supporting the business, technology is the business. Our IT leadership and workflows gives us a uniquely strong foundation to be the leading platform for digital transformation across the enterprise. In Q4, IT workflow products remained strong. ITSM delivered 17 deals over $1 million. Our AI and machine learning capabilities embedded within our Pro SKU continue to resonate with our customers. ITSM Pro penetration is now over 20%. The AI/ML capabilities of our Pro SKUs are automating processes to allow people to focus on the work that really matters. We saw a three times increase in usage of our virtual agent technology in 2020. And our Element AI acquisition underscores our commitment to being the leader in AI-enabled workflows. Element AI\u2019s deep bench of world-class scientists and practitioners will accelerate our AI innovation on the Now Platform, delivering not only better capabilities for IT, but for employee and customer experiences as well. ITOM was included in 16 of the top 20 deals and had 15 deals over $1 million. Risk had a very strong Q4, booking more wins than all of the prior year combined. Our ability to manage risk is really resonating with customers. ServiceNow is no longer viewed as back-end IT-oriented solution. We\u2019re now seen as a strategic partner that impacts the entire business. Customer workflows is our next $1 billion-plus market opportunity for ServiceNow, and Q4 showed strong momentum. Customer workflows were included in 11 of our top 20 deals, driving such wins as AT&T. 10 of our customer workflow deals were greater than $1 million. In this pandemic, the employee experience is more important than ever, and our employee workflow is seeing strong demand. In Q4, 11 of our top 20 deals included employee workflows. The pandemic is creating the greatest workflow challenge of our time, and ServiceNow is responding with agility, speed and continuous innovation. We began last spring, as you\u2019ll remember, with our emergency response apps helping the state of Washington and many others respond to COVID. We fast followed that release with our Safe Workplace suite of apps that has demonstrated the power of the NOW platform and great employee workflows that we can deliver very quickly, in fact more than 900 organizations now have downloaded the suite already. This week, we just launched the first in a suite of plan vaccine administration applications delivered out of the box functionality for our customers. Our comprehensive approach enables workflow solutions to the complex challenges of vaccine district, administration, and monitoring. As we have done with Safe Workplace, we will be delivering continuous innovation with our vaccine administration management applications. I'm excited to announce that the State of North Carolina, Department of Health and Human Services is already leveraging the ServiceNow platform to power its COVID vaccine management system to help quickly and efficiently vaccinate 10 million North Carolinians. President Biden has declared the distribution of COVID vaccines, a top priority for his administration. This is one of the great workflow challenges of our time, as we are doing right now in Scotland, North Carolina, and many other places, ServiceNow is ready to ensure vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring that it's simple, it's fast and it's effective. It'll be so at the federal, state and local level. In summary, we had an outstanding close to 2020, and we are not slowing down. We are changing the world one workflow at a time and our vision is really resonating. C-Level executives realize that behind every great experience is a great word flow. Our company is hitting on all cylinders. In 2020, we grew our global workforce by 26% hiring 3,000 people in 25 countries with most hired and on-boarded digitally. We are hiring incredible talent, including some of the greatest minds in the AI industry. Our culture is incredibly strong. Our employee engagement is at historic highs. So too is our employee retention. Our brand is strong. C-suite awareness increased in double-digits. Our innovation pipeline is robust. We delivered 70% more features and innovations on the platform in 2020. Our partner ecosystem is expanding: IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and all the great partners in India and many others have joined the workflow revolution with us. Together, we're bringing the innovation speed of a start-up with the scale and reach of a rapidly growing $5 billion plus pure play SaaS company, and our RPO is nearly double that at $9 billion. We're the only born in the cloud software company to have reached this size with our large scale M&A, and we have a clear path to achieve our $10 billion revenue target. We are also deeply committed to making the world to work better for people to helping our customers succeed. We are deeply committed to making the world work better to. Gina will share more about our focus on elevating our global impact. I'm incredibly proud of our just announced $100 million investment in an impact on benefiting underserved communities. And we're deeply committed to being a leader in building a diverse inclusive workforce in which everyone feels that they belong because diverse teams with an indomitable will to win create great companies. ServiceNow is such a company and we are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. That's our dream, and we will pursue it tirelessly with courage, passion, and conviction. Thank you. Over to you, Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Happy New Year, everyone. I want to start-off by echoing Bill's praise for all the employees of ServiceNow. It has been a year of unprecedented challenges, but the team has remained focused on executing and meeting the needs of our customers. I couldn't be more impressed with our resilience, which is a testament to our great culture here at ServiceNow. And thanks to our people that we delivered another fantastic quarter to cap a strong year. We exceeded the high-end of our subscription revenues and subscription billing guidance, which carried through to strong free cash flow generation. Q4 subscription revenues were $1.184 billion representing 32% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a three-point tailwind from FX. Q4 subscriptions billing were very strong at $1.828 billion representing 41% year-over-year growth and a $183 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. Adjusted growth was 38% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.9 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. And current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth. FX was about a three-point tailwind. The traction we are seeing in our top line results, reflect our focus on meeting the needs of our customers and their employees. As Bill noted, the workflow revolution is underway and is centered around the best experiences. And that\u2019s the Now Platform\u2019s super power, the ability to deliver workflows that create those great experiences for people. The NOW Platform is playing a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. We're treating our customers as partners, listening and learning about their challenges so we can help solve them. We aren't selling point products. We\u2019re providing them with comprehensive solutions with measurable results and quick time to value. Better together, that's the power of our portfolio. It's this attention to our customers' needs that\u2019s driving our best-in-class renewal rate of 99%, demonstrating the stickiness of our business as the NOW Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our sales teams continued to win bigger deals in Q4, including our largest deal ever, which is three times the size of our previous largest deal. We closed 89 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter, with average deal sizes up 18% year-over-year. In 2020, we added nearly 700 net new customers, ending the year with almost 6,900 enterprises. The number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 40% in fiscal 2020. Customers are realizing the strategic value of combining ServiceNow IT workflows with everything from HR, CSM and our App Engine to deliver greater value across the enterprise. Our ability to land new logos and expand our existing relationships amid a pandemic, further validate the strength of our platform and the value we're delivering to enterprise C-suite. Turning to profitability, Q4 operating margin was 22%, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance. Year-over-year, our Q4 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental R&D investments and marketing spend on pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, up 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and strong collection. For full year 2020, operating margin was 25%, up 300 basis points year-over-year and free cash flow was 32%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we\u2019re seeing in the business. The highly affected industries we outlined early last year, which represented about 20% of our business, continue to see macro headwinds, but remained resilient. Three of our top 20 deals in the quarter were from highly impacted industries, including retail, automotive and energy. We do expect headwinds in some severely impacted industries to persist in 2021. However, retention of existing customers remains very strong in Q4. Overall, we're entering 2021 with strong secular tailwinds created by a surge in demand for digital transformation. Our pipeline continues to look healthy, and our brand continues to resonate with enterprise leaders. ServiceNow is exceptionally well-positioned to seize this opportunity. We have the unique platform and innovative product suite businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Turning to guidance, for transparency and clarity, I\u2019d like to call out a few items. First, as I noted earlier, we saw $80 million in early payments from customers in Q4, which was an approximately 200 basis point tailwind to full year subscription billings growth in 2020. This results in a more significant headwind of about 350 basis points for 2021 billings growth. To be clear, these early payments have no effect on the timing of revenue. We've also previously talked about how early renewals and success with very large customers were impacting billing cycles as they can add additional volatility to timing and duration. This makes billings a less reliable leading indicator of top-line growth. Given this noise and to provide investors with even greater transparency, we're introducing quarterly cRPO guidance. We believe cRPO will provide better visibility and is a more consistent indicator of business performance, normalizing for timing and duration noise. We will continue to provide billings guidance throughout 2021 as a transition period. Second, the need to digitally transform has been accelerated by the current macro environment, creating a very large opportunity for ServiceNow. With the savings we are recognizing from our more efficient operating environment, we're continuing to invest in R&D and quota-bearing resources to drive innovation and pipeline to fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well-positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration. These investments include those we were making in AI, such as the acquisition of Element AI. Similar to previous investments and successful growth initiatives like our Pro SKUs or geographic expansion, we will be disciplined about our spend. Beyond our business investments, we will also be investing in people and communities. We've always been focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging. And as Bill noted, we recently announced our first ever $100 million investment in a racial equity fund to build equitable opportunity for Black communities. This investment is expected to earn a solid return, while facilitating sustainable wealth creation through homeownership, entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization. Finally, COVID cases have been spiking in recent weeks, and some regions have reentered lockdown protocols. While we haven't seen any significant impact on our business, we will continue to monitor and be transparent in our disclosures throughout 2021. With that in mind, for Q1 we expect subscription revenues between $1.275 billion and $1.28 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including a four-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.31 billion and $1.315 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early payments from customers in 2020, our Q1 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of four points. We expect cRPO growth of 32% year-over-year, including a five-point FX tailwind. We expect an operating margin of 25% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect subscription revenues between $5.48 billion and $5.5 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a three-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $6.205 billion and $6.225 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our 2021 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. This growth reflects an acceleration in net new ACV in 2021, and it also includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of two points. We expect subscription gross margin of 85%, reflecting some federal and public sector customers moving to our newly launched Azure offering as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. We expect an operating margin of 23.5%, representing 150 basis points expansion off of our pre-COVID 2020 run rate. I would note that this is also an incremental 50 basis points more than the 100 basis points of expansion we target each year. Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. In summary, in 2020, we delivered a combination of both strong top line growth and profitability, an incredible accomplishment in a COVID environment. Our outstanding results continued to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, our focus on building deep customer relationships and our commitment to enabling their digital transformation. We\u2019re delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. We are the platform company for digital business. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team's performance and our unrelenting execution in a turbulent year. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. We're well on our way to becoming a $10 billion revenue company on the strength of incredible organic innovation. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. So in relation to the margin outlook, understand the investment opportunity that you have, but also curious what you've factored in, in terms of any increased T&E and maybe perhaps even there I say the return to a little bit of business travel throughout the year. And can you help us understand kind of what assumptions underlie the margin outlook on that front?\nGina Mastantuono: Sure, Sterling. Thanks for the question. We talked about really continuing to focus on driving a balance of growth and profitability, and I've been pretty transparent and open about those margins. We are currently expecting that a more normalized T&E will come back towards the back-half of 2021. And so the expectations on the front-half will be similar to what we've been seeing, but that we would expect some more normalized T&E to start again in the back-half.\nSterling Auty: Great. And then one just follow-up. In terms of the digital transformations in the applications that you're tying into, I'd be kind of curious beyond HR and CSM, what are perhaps some of the other applications that you think that customers are going to more rely on your platform as hopefully the economy picks up on the back of vaccinations?\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much, Sterling. This is Bill. What you're seeing out there is each industry has its own nuances. For example, in financial services, I talked about security. Obviously, the future of work is a big movement to work from anywhere and certainly enable that modern work environment and do that in a way where people can be onboarded without actually even meeting them, train them appropriately and do the ongoing management of people where they can truly execute their mission and they know all the information and they have all the data to do their job. So this is happening in every industry and it's happened in every geo and each persona has its own unique needs. What we think is unique about ServiceNow is that this platform, think of it as the workflow automation platform, comprehends all the opportunities with App Engine to customize things very rapidly like vaccine management, for example. It also offers the IntegrationHub. And what the IntegrationHub enables is all the things from RPA, process mining, API integration, process analytics, native mobile, contextual interfaces, and all the other things that CIOs and leaders of businesses are counting on to create end-to-end continuity in the business. And that's what makes us so unique. So having that platform advantage and our well-known position in IT is equally as relevant with the employee experience, because now you have one portal with a consumer-grade UX, all the complexity is hidden, all the onboarding caring for the employee is done and they are right off and running with their mission. In some cases, I had one very high-level executive tell me, I haven't met the 5,000 people I hired this year because of the Now Platform. And then on customer service management, in every industry, and I gave the AT&T example as one, you're seeing this frictionless business environment really take off. So how do we deal with the end consumer and do so directly in a way that enables our services to be consumed. So you're seeing this ease of use around ServiceNow, you're seeing the virtual agent guide people through subscription processes, and you're seeing all of our deep machine learning and AI help the customer navigate their sign-on processes and so forth. And the workflow then becomes the exception because humans shouldn't have to get involved in these processes unless the computer didn't get the job done and that gives us such an advantage because we're seeing situations where we can literally consolidate hundreds of systems that our Now Platform take out huge costs, give the customer a great experience and obviously not put so much pressure on human capital because people are only engaged when they're absolutely necessary in the customer satisfaction process. So you're seeing a mass consolidation of all the old stuff to the Now Platform. You're seeing IT employee, customer and all of the App Engine and IntegrationHub opportunities really come together on one common platform, one data model and one architecture. So it's now a solutions company. It's now selling a suite and the broad spectrum of offerings gives us reach to the whole C-level executive team, not just one persona on the executive team.\nSterling Auty: Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott: My pleasure, Sterling. \nOperator: For our next question, we have Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Keith, your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Yes, thank you very much. I'll ask my questions - my two questions concurrently if I could. One, in the comments you mentioned that you thought you would see an acceleration of net new ACV, which \u2013 in 2021, which I thought was very interesting. I was wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more on, a, the visibility into that; and b, anything that's bubbling up in terms of there seems to be a greater emphasis to drive that net new ACV what area? The follow-on question I want to direct to you, Bill, if I could. Last year, you're pretty clear that acquisitions was not part of your strategy and maybe some tuck-ins here and there. 2021 is a new year, lots of changes. The digital landscape is a greater priority. Is there any change in your thoughts as you're considering how ServiceNow could effectively build that long-term model as it relates to M&A? That's it for me and many thanks.\nBill McDermott: Yes. Well, thank you very much, Keith. Maybe I'll start off and then give Gina a chance to build as she wishes on the net new ACV inquiry. First of all, I'll just say that net new ACV on a year-over-year basis will increase and the pipelines that we have in the company and we manage the company on what we call a CEO dashboard in real-time give us much greater coverage than we had last year. So we know that the facts substantiate the net new ACV increase. One of the interesting things that is fascinating is actually our executive briefings have increased 70% on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about our ability to get to the C-suite and increase the contact in this kind of virtual environment, it's actually gone way up. So a lot of people, I guess, need a good meeting and they want to figure out how they're going to digitally transform and the Now Platform has just dynamite tailwind key. Now, in terms of the whole digital landscape, IDC, I think, the $7.4 trillion is very interesting statistic. This is factual. If you just look at the way companies are prioritizing their investments, the one thing that's not going to get deep prioritized is digital transformation and things that enable digital business, because it's really the only way to either get your stuff competitive or to increase your competitive advantage and your peer group, and every CEO completely understand that. And within that context, I think the uniqueness of ServiceNow to have so much, so much momentum, not just in exciting new areas like the future of work with our employee experience or customer service management, which is really a frictionless economy now more and more coming ServiceNow's way, but even in our core with IT. If you look at our ITSM core business, it's outgrown our internal expectations by a lot. And you've seen with the Pro SKU where we add on the machine learning and the AI capabilities on a platform approach that two is growing fast and our engineering team is incredible here. I mean the level of innovation they're pushing out with 70% increase 2020 over 2019 and we have major releases coming this year commensurate with what we did last year. So I wanted to give you a lot of confidence that the net new ACV is going up, the customers are buying and the pipeline is super strong. And here is one thing that I found fascinating. There was a study done by Deloitte. And with all this digital transformation, a lot of executives are looking back and saying, hey, why didn't I get a better return on all I put into digital? And what they found is that about three quarters of the digital transformation projects, didn't give the yielded return on investment that they had hoped for and the number one root cause was integration. So as you think about the Now Platform integrating with 550 systems of record out of the box and all the collaboration tools, no matter which one the customer likes and have that completely synchronized into the Now Platform out of the box and you're up and running in days. It's kind of an attractive value proposition to our customers and even non-customers that want to jump onboard.\nGina Mastantuono: I wouldn't add anything more on that. I think that that was a great answer, Bill, on the acceleration of net new ACV. On the M&A conversation, I think, Bill, I know you have a perspective.\nBill McDermott: Yes. I mean, look here's the situation, Keith. We are not against M&A. So far we have done technology tuck-ins or we've done, what I would call, human capital tuck-ins such as we've done with AI. We've gotten tremendous people into the organization to put all the value into the Now Platform and to generate net new revenue growth in the SKUs such as what we did with IT, we'll do with employee, we'll do with customer and obviously we'll do with the low code, no code innovation that we can give to the creator, which is literally a business analyst or anyone that wants to write a low code application in an enterprise. So the way we look at large scale or larger scale M&A, we wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't look at every opportunity to satisfy our customers and our shareholders, but it's important just to register with you that our projection on the 10 billion is clearly in hand with our organic innovation and the momentum we have in the marketplace with our customers, and also the non-customers that want to join the team. So, there's nothing on the table right now for a larger deal, but it's not like we don't have our eyes wide open at the various opportunities. And if they ever presented themselves, you would know that we thought through it rigorously and it was part of our strategic imperative to really do the best we can for our shareholders and our customers. But right now that is not on the table and it's not something that's actionable at this time.\nKeith Bachman: Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: For our next question we have Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Raimo, your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hi. Thank you and congrats from me as well. I have two quick questions. One number question I'll start with that before I forget. Gina, like I got a couple of questions in the 200 basis points headwind you got in 2020, like, can you just walk us through the math how that becomes like 350 basis point in 2021? They had a good few guys that just kind of struggle with that one. And then let's start with the one for Bill. Bill, ITSM Pro should give you like we see the early momentum there. You talked about the 20% penetration. Just how does it help you on the on the expansion and the renewal and the conversations you get with clients has a really good tool to engage the client base? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Sure. So I'll take the first one. So yes, in Q4, we talked about 80 million of billings that were accelerated in Q4 out of Q1 of 2020. And so basically if you take that 80 out of Q4 and put it back into 2020 \u2013 and put it back into 2021 that's where you see that double impact, right. And so, you might take it out of 2020 and add it back into 2021. And so it's about a 200 basis point tailwind to 2020, but then about 350 basis headwind in 2021. So we try to do all the math for you, so that's pretty clear. And just to be clear that these were early customer payments. And we feel like it's one time in nature, and it was really results of our customers having excess cash driven by the OpEx savings that we said they were seeing in 2020. And so, I hope that that clarifies you, Raimo.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. That really helps. Thank you. Appreciate that.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Great. And then Raimo, I\u2019ll just give you a view for our ITSM Pro because that was your question. First of all, it\u2019s growing in steep double-digits, very important. And while we\u2019ve penetrated 20%, that means we still have 80% to go. So it's a really, really one of the growth opportunity from a shareholder value creation perspective. But what you\u2019re looking at is the remote IT services requests growing exponentially, and many of the IT organizations out there are looking for ways to deflect lower-tier cases. So by leveraging chatbots and streamlining processes part of the AI ML capabilities are embedded with our Pro SKU. So that\u2019s one aspect of it. And when you start to think about all the innovation that we\u2019ve built in to this platform and the latest product releases, again the value is so much greater because of the organic innovation the team has put into it. But customers are loving, gee, wow, I can transform IT, which then has an impact on the employee experience and the whole future of work. And incidentally, there isn\u2019t a customer out there now that\u2019s not asking us to revolutionize their call center operations or enable people to work from a virtual environment better and obviously in this frictionless economy how can I do things with a no-touch or possibly the lowest touch possible, how can I eliminate the middleman in my margin pursuit as companies trying to grow in different industries. All of that requires the IT backbone. So what you\u2019re seeing is a multiplying effect of one story compounding into another and really stretching the perimeter of what we\u2019re doing for executives across the enterprise. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing deal sizes get larger and larger. You are seeing us be in a very strong position in terms of the product, the value that it delivers, and the processes that we\u2019ve built for not only pre-sale sale value creation but also post-sale value creation. So ML, AI and the leadership that we\u2019ve built into this platform is really unique.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, very clear. Congrats again.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Raimo.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Kash, your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Bill and Gina and the rest of the team. My question for you, Bill, is the company has done a phenomenal job increasing its wallet share with really large companies through ITSM Pro, CSM workflow, HR, et cetera. The question for you is, as you approach the $10 billion journey and you look at other markets and software, you tend to have companies that\u2019s in database market or ERP, have a customer base that\u2019s closer to 100,000, 200,000, maybe even 400,000, 500,000. So as you look at the \u2013 how do we put it, the scaling up of ServiceNow into a company that can serve not just 8,000, 9,000 customers, but more like 100,000, 200,000 customers, what does that journey look like? And what are your plans to make this excellent piece of technology that\u2019s known to less than 10,000, to be actually known and adopted by 100,000, maybe 200,000 customers? Thank you so much. That\u2019s my only question.\nBill McDermott: It\u2019s my pleasure, Kash. Thank you very much for your kind remarks. As you think about our company, what\u2019s the beauty of us right now is we execute with the speed of a start-up, but we have the scale of a global company. So you\u2019re seeing us now expand in Europe quite dramatically. We\u2019re hiring amazing, amazing talent. You\u2019re seeing us make moves into the Middle East. You\u2019re seeing the expansion in Latin America. We\u2019re really like starting to kick it into high gear in Asia with an expansion in South Korea. We have lots of plans and we have a well known brand, of course, in Australia, in other more mature markets. In the United States, I feel like we\u2019re just getting started based upon the amazing receptivity to this Now Platform. And I think that a lot of that came from our emergency response to COVID and now the vaccine management. And you look at markets and industries like financial services, like telecommunications, like our government business and so many more. So, I would say, we\u2019re just getting started in terms of the real extents in for scale. The brand has now become a very well-known brand. The ecosystem tailwind has really kicked in, in the last 12 months. And once you get calls from amazing big brands and they say I have to team up with you, my customers are demanding that I team up with you and integrate beautifully in the Now Platform. My customers are telling me. That\u2019s a large telco company. In fact, it\u2019s not the one that I mentioned as the example, and they said, we got to do more with you. So you\u2019re seeing now a world where the Fortune 2000 gives us an extreme opportunity for growth beyond $10 billion. But our brand and industry and geography and persona, and same account revenue growth and net new logos, which Gina and I also have an operating plan that increases pretty large this year-over-year in addition to the NNACV, net new ACV. So Kash, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 look at our four businesses that we already are in, look at every one of them as multibillion opportunities and then don\u2019t forget the platform because I think more and more as the citizen developer concept takes off the ServiceNow. It will find this in locations that go way beyond the Fortune 2000. And keep in mind, a lot of those large companies that you mentioned, they might have about 1,000 companies and they say they have a couple of hundred thousand because of all the subsidiaries and so on. So we\u2019re talking about real companies with real names. And I think the subsidiaries of those and all peers, the world will really take off as well. We\u2019re in the early days here.\nKash Rangan: Very exciting. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Walter Pritchard from Citi. Walter, your line is open.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thank you. Bill, a question for you just broadly. I think if we were sitting here \u2013 when we were sitting here three or four years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have imagined the success that the employee product and the customer service product have had. And I\u2019m wondering how you think about, over the next several years, your growth from more prescribed SaaS applications versus the past that I feel like you\u2019ve talked about more on this call. And what would you point to in terms of some of the emerging SaaS products that might be today where HR and customer service were three or four years ago? Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Yes, sure, absolutely. Well, first of all, I would feature, Walter, the platform itself. And I believe strongly that ServiceNow has now pivoted to be that platform company for digital transformation. And that is a big difference from being, \u201cwhat some used to say was the ERP of IT\u201d. So think about this as a platform company. Think about the core business and the continuous innovation that we\u2019re doing in the core to stretch the core into new frontiers. We have a whole organization that is focused on the next big thing. So all the businesses that you would understand well, whether we invented it or someone else did, they all want to cooperate with the Now Platform, because the IntegrationHub enables them to get in. And once they get in, then they can build their imagination and their dreams with ServiceNow. So, I think, there\u2019s a big business model in that that we have only scratched the surface on. If you think about employee experience, I think the companies that I talked to including ours, we run someone else\u2019s system of record. But if you talk to 13,000 people in ServiceNow, nobody could possibly pick the system of record out of a lineup because all they look at is this gorgeous consumer-grade UI that\u2019s driven by the ServiceNow portal, where all the services that they need based on their job profile are right there for them, I mean how big is that market. And the same thing with customer service management. We\u2019re learning fast in this new world that we\u2019ve gone way beyond SFA and up-sells and cross-sells and conditioning that around a marketing campaign. We\u2019re into business model innovation, where great companies like Disney or AT&T are rethinking their business model entirely and they\u2019re capitalizing on the streaming rage, and they\u2019re coming up with subscription business models that reinvent the customer experience and give them net new businesses. ServiceNow is in that to win. And I think that TAM is absolutely unbelievable. The other TAM that\u2019s pretty interesting that nobody spends much time talking about, but it\u2019s one of the reasons I see ServiceNow's future is so bright. If you just take paper-based processes that are clocking up all of these companies and you digitize them to the Now Platform, there is a well-known bank out there that says the U.S. market alone is a $280 billion market, which maybe globally that\u2019s $400 billion market. And then I think this platform business, I really see an amazing, amazing future for the platform business. Just think about this. If you\u2019re the state of North Carolina and you\u2019re a ServiceNow customer and you\u2019ve got a vaccine management challenge, like literally in days they can build a custom application tailored to 10 million citizens to get them the vaccine in their arm to protect them from this terrible virus. Again, that is just built on to the Now Platform using the App Engine, the IntegrationHub and all the innovation that our great engineers have built. So, we\u2019re at the early days and there are some things that we have planned for that will be forthcoming in the months and year ahead. But right now, I just want to keep you focused on what we\u2019re doing, because literally we\u2019ve only scratched the surfaces of these businesses.\nWalter Pritchard: Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Walter.\nOperator: Next, we have Tom Roderick from Stifel. Tom, your line is open.\nTom Roderick: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and I\u2019ll echo the sentiments on congratulations on a great finish to a challenging but phenomenal year. Bill, I wanted to ask you just a question on the App Engine. Just looking at this percentage of ACV mix surged to 15%, you\u2019re seeing certainly larger and larger customers and more customers lean in on the App Engine vision. I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about that. In particular, if you could talk about what the App Engine vision has meant for your relationship with the channel partners, Accenture, Deloitte and others? Just broadly speaking, it would be fantastic to hear about how you look at that today and how that\u2019s changing, how big customers and partners like your SIs are leaning in here?\nBill McDermott: Yes, fantastic. So let\u2019s start with the whole idea of the partners. There isn\u2019t a partner that\u2019s a global partner right now that does not have a business plan that\u2019s $1 billion or more with ServiceNow. And many of them are in the multiple billions, and they\u2019re building their business model. Some of them tell me, they look at the Now Platform as the cross-platform integration engine of their business model with the various other companies, whether it\u2019s system of record software company or collaborative software company that they also have partnerships with. But they\u2019re looking at us as the center of that digital transformation effort. That is a very, very big tailwind. Many of the net new innovative applications that they will bring to their customers, they\u2019re building on the Now Platform because the low-code, no-code simplicity of the platform can enable them to do things at record speeds, and I think that is a big, big unlock for them. So platform is really big. I also think the ML and the AI movement that we\u2019re on, Element AI was kind of the finishing touch of four M&A moves that we made, which was really about acquiring not just patents and thought leadership, but real enablement of the Now Platform, so we can truly unleash humanity in ways that heretofore were not possible. And the computer and the human now can do things in terms of decision-making, removing soul-crushing work that nobody really wants to do, issuing workflow orders only when it\u2019s necessary because the virtual agent can solve 90% of the problems and most engagement with customers. And this is now like a whole new universe because many of those partners looked at us an IT. And now the employee experience, for example, is one of Deloitte's most desired personas and they're actually extraordinarily good at the employee experience and they give us reach globally and there are others on customer service management now that is saying what we\u2019re doing especially with digitizing business processes, ease of use on subscription models, like Disney+. We are so honored to see Disney+ say, that\u2019s our digital bridge to the future. We have great core businesses, but this is a digital bridge to the future. And ServiceNow is right in the mix of all of that. So look, it\u2019s a once in a generation opportunity, and I\u2019m really, really happy. And I also look at the technology partners that we have now that have just adopted us as the standard for IT and so many other things. We made the announcement on IBM where they basically looked at their ITSM on-premise business and said we got to go to the cloud. We\u2019d rather go to the cloud with you that\u2019s where the innovation is and we've won very good partnerships like we're doing with Microsoft, connecting with O365 teams dynamics and bringing a whole new understanding of what\u2019s possible with the Now Platform working interdependently with Microsoft. So, all that and more is all in the mix from our growth plan.\nTom Roderick: That\u2019s great color, Bill. Congratulations. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question, we have Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Gregg, your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thanks very much, and congratulations as well on a very strong end to the year. I\u2019ll just ask one question in the interest of time. Bill, you recently hired a leader for your customer workflows business, and you\u2019ve obviously done well here. But can you walk through what you see as incremental solutions or monetization opportunities in this area?\nBill McDermott: Yes, absolutely. Again, we\u2019re hiring best-in-class talent. We obviously have extremely bold ambitions to what we think we can do in the customer service management arena. Also, John Ball, who is the gentleman that we hired as you know, he ran the Einstein initiative over another software company in the area. And we feel that he has domain expertise. And when he saw what we were doing in customer service management, he said, this is where I want to work. He said, this is the biggest thing that I've seen. He said I can't get over this NOW Platform, its simplicity, how quickly I can innovate on it. I'll give you an example. He was front and center on the vaccine management innovation. Literally, that whole process took us three weeks where vaccine management as a concept and an application was developed in three weeks and launched to the global marketplace. And it's in Scotland, it's in UK, it's in many states now in the United States. And in the not too distant future, hopefully it\u2019s helping many of the federal agencies help the Biden administration save lives here in America and obviously in other parts of the world too. So it's the speed at which you can innovate on this platform. It's the pristine nature of this platform that you don't have to work with multiple different platforms from different M&A moves or different levels of complexity that others have built up over time. Here, it's just like there it is innovate on, it. What's the idea, let's code it and let's get it out to the market. We did emergency response apps, if you remember, over a weekend and we launched them globally in a week. I mean it\u2019s just unheard of. And that's what's really exciting that our engineers are spending all of their time coding new innovations as opposed to integrating past applications.\nGregg Moskowitz: It's great. Thanks Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Gregg.\nOperator: We have time for one more question, and it's from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Fred, your line is open.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you very much for taking my question. I thought I'd actually go on a bit of a different direction here. And I'd like to ask as someone who actually led No-Code projects for Fortune 500 companies during the pandemic, I'd love to dig into your Low-Code vision a little bit more. How do you see ServiceNow positioned within the Low- and No-Code markets, to be able to enable line of business users to develop workflow automation and really deliver on that promise of democratizing development?\nBill McDermott: Yes, that's the whole point. That\u2019s what we're talking about here. I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor. And he said there doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it. I said yes why don't you get a business analyst and we'll design a workflow around that, and then you can launch it out into your company in record speed like a couple of days. So, what's unique here in the case of vaccine management as an example, you took the platform and you customized something in a few days basically to vaccinate 5.5 million people. But in the case of something where you just need to flow chart a workflow and rethink a process to, for example, roll out a rewards program or a recognition program that could be done by a business analyst. So we're not inhibited by prepackaged software or doing things that are quite complex in development in the case of the platform because all you need is an idea. And if you have an idea, a business analyst can code on this platform. If you have an idea that's a little bit more complex, you can have a Low-Code situation where somebody with a little bit of computer intelligence skills can navigate this platform. So this is kind of the secret sauce. I tell you, when I think about what it can be because of the architecture and the simplicity of the platform itself, our imaginations just keep getting more and more fulfilled with dreams and excitement. And I\u2019m just so excited by our engineering teams. And Gina and I have made sure that we fund them now appropriately and most of the investments around here go to the great engineers and the people that serve our customers. There's zero bureaucracy in this company, just like there's zero bureaucracy in the platform.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q4 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Having confronted an unprecedented global environment, we are looking ahead with optimism and are thankful to be so well positioned to serve our customers. Needless to say, we delivered a market-leading 2020. We significantly beat expectations across the board, bringing great momentum into the New Year. I could not be proud of our team's execution. We delivered over 30% organic top line growth, 25% operating margins, and $1.4 billion in free cash flow, just an outstanding performance and a testament to our ServiceNow strong culture. Throughout the year, we led with courage and conviction. We took care of our team, our customers and our communities. And most importantly, we led with ServiceNow's purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. We strive to see the world through our customers' eyes with empathy to address their needs. The workflow revolution is happening and the pandemic is accelerating digital transformation. Every business needs speed, agility and resilience. And every C-suite leader wants to deliver great experiences for their employees and their customers. Businesses are changing the way they operate. They need to deliver fierce customer loyalty and deep employee engagement to win. It's all about people, empathy at mass scale is the business imperative of the 21 century. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovations have all intersected at the perfect moment in time, a paradigm here is happening worldwide. In 2020, for the first time in history, we saw a digital transformation spending accelerate despite GDP declining globally. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing. According to IDC, worldwide digital transformation investments will total more than $7.4 trillion by 2024. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders. ServiceNow is the platform company for digital business. The Now Platform, what I call the platform of platforms offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. Our simple low-code app development enables fast workflows to solve any business challenge, delivering consumer-grade digital experiences. The Now Platform enables easier and faster implementation, delivering unbeatable time to value and fast ROI. That's the beauty of the Now Platform, one platform, one data model and one architecture. We seamlessly integrated all of this and through our system and that system integrate seamlessly with all systems of record that matter most to our customers. We deliver workflows through their preferred collaboration platform as well. We give our customers the freedom of choice to use their preferred tools and the unique ability to build apps at record speed. Hungry and humble is a core ServiceNow value, it's proven now than ever. We are grateful to be in such a strong position at such a pivotal moment and we are hungry. We are eager to use our strengths to help our customers succeed, help make our community stronger and help create great experiences for people. We are seeing an extraordinary expansion of use cases in our business. Healthcare organizations are using ServiceNow to improve operations and service delivery, which means better outcomes for people. St. Jude Children's Hospital has been on a journey to accelerate progress towards finding cures and saving children. In 2020, COVID-19 created a significant headwind to that mission. With much of the hospital staff required to work-from-home, the need to digitize manual workflows became more important than ever. The hospital leveraged ServiceNow's low-code App Engine and IntegrationHub to integrate disparate systems and build custom end-to-end workflows, ultimately allowing them to ensure seamless delivery of clinical services. In under four weeks, the ServiceNow solution was implemented at St. Jude Children's Hospital and everybody was moving toward their goal. We're also proud to be supporting NHS Scotland and their efforts to vaccinate 5.5 million citizens. NHS Scotland is using the Now Platform and our customer workflow to deploy a customized solution designed to meet their specific needs. Deployment took only six weeks, showing the agility of the Now Platform. ServiceNow is enabling a comprehensive solution for the scheduling and reporting of vaccination for Scotland's most vulnerable citizens. Within 12 hours of roll-out, NHS Scotland booked over 220,000 appointments. So as you can see, it's not just about business workflows, it's about real people. Enterprise digital transformation is how every organization in every sector in every geo are adapting, growing, creating new business models and empowering their people to be productive in any environment under any condition. That's modern, agile, resilient business at work and it's being powered by the Now Platform. Our unique platform and innovative product suite, our strong brand, high customer satisfaction and compelling value proposition are the differentiating factors and competitive advantages fueling our performance. Our Q4 results are testament. We dreamed big and delivered. We grew billings by more than 40% year-over-year organically. We delivered 89 deals greater than $1 million and now have close to 1,100 customers paying us over $1 million annually. We landed our largest deal ever, surpassing the deal record we set in Q3 with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Deal sizes overall keep getting larger. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 99%. Here are some key customer wins from Q4. We signed a multi-year and multi-product strategic deal with AT&T. They are transforming by focusing on broadband connectivity, 5G and software-based entertainment, while relentlessly focusing on digital, consumer preferences and experiences. We're delighted to work with AT&T Communications in its transformation. ServiceNow's AI-powered platform and service operations product lines will provide AT&T accurate and real-time operational visibility into every layer of the network fabric and help deliver the best-in-class customer experience, better experiences for people enabled by ServiceNow. One of the UK's big four banks is using multiple ServiceNow products, including our purpose-built new financial services operations product to help transform the way it operates and to deliver better customer experiences. The bank has seen a 70% efficiency and improvement of payment processing by integrating the Now Platform into its core banking systems. With ServiceNow, this bank implemented new automated processes in 60 workdays. In their words, employees moved from cut and paste, swivel chair manual processes to efficient, automated workflows. In one case, employees went from managing 10 requests an hour to 1,000 requests in three minutes on the Now Platform, better experiences for people. PayPal recently expanded their relationship with ServiceNow as a key partner for elements of their digital transformation. And we're proud to have expanded our relationship with Nike, who is using the Now Platform to create better customer and employee experiences. Other Q4 deals across our portfolio represented wins with major customers in key sectors such as Booking.com in travel and hospitality, BP in energy, Santander UK and USAA in financial services and the list goes on and on. I hear so many ServiceNow success stories every day. Companies are onboarding thousands of people in a work-from-home environment, making them feel productive and part of the team from day one. Customers are going live on the Now Platform in days, not months, making a difference for people now, not next month or next year, now. More productive employees, happier customers, more efficient operations, there is not a CEO on the planet, who doesn't want that, the Now Platform delivers. These examples show how technology is no longer supporting the business, technology is the business. Our IT leadership and workflows gives us a uniquely strong foundation to be the leading platform for digital transformation across the enterprise. In Q4, IT workflow products remained strong. ITSM delivered 17 deals over $1 million. Our AI and machine learning capabilities embedded within our Pro SKU continue to resonate with our customers. ITSM Pro penetration is now over 20%. The AI/ML capabilities of our Pro SKUs are automating processes to allow people to focus on the work that really matters. We saw a three times increase in usage of our virtual agent technology in 2020. And our Element AI acquisition underscores our commitment to being the leader in AI-enabled workflows. Element AI's deep bench of world-class scientists and practitioners will accelerate our AI innovation on the Now Platform, delivering not only better capabilities for IT, but for employee and customer experiences as well. ITOM was included in 16 of the top 20 deals and had 15 deals over $1 million. Risk had a very strong Q4, booking more wins than all of the prior year combined. Our ability to manage risk is really resonating with customers. ServiceNow is no longer viewed as back-end IT-oriented solution. We're now seen as a strategic partner that impacts the entire business. Customer workflows is our next $1 billion-plus market opportunity for ServiceNow, and Q4 showed strong momentum. Customer workflows were included in 11 of our top 20 deals, driving such wins as AT&T. 10 of our customer workflow deals were greater than $1 million. In this pandemic, the employee experience is more important than ever, and our employee workflow is seeing strong demand. In Q4, 11 of our top 20 deals included employee workflows. The pandemic is creating the greatest workflow challenge of our time, and ServiceNow is responding with agility, speed and continuous innovation. We began last spring, as you'll remember, with our emergency response apps helping the state of Washington and many others respond to COVID. We fast followed that release with our Safe Workplace suite of apps that has demonstrated the power of the NOW platform and great employee workflows that we can deliver very quickly, in fact more than 900 organizations now have downloaded the suite already. This week, we just launched the first in a suite of plan vaccine administration applications delivered out of the box functionality for our customers. Our comprehensive approach enables workflow solutions to the complex challenges of vaccine district, administration, and monitoring. As we have done with Safe Workplace, we will be delivering continuous innovation with our vaccine administration management applications. I'm excited to announce that the State of North Carolina, Department of Health and Human Services is already leveraging the ServiceNow platform to power its COVID vaccine management system to help quickly and efficiently vaccinate 10 million North Carolinians. President Biden has declared the distribution of COVID vaccines, a top priority for his administration. This is one of the great workflow challenges of our time, as we are doing right now in Scotland, North Carolina, and many other places, ServiceNow is ready to ensure vaccine distribution, administration and monitoring that it's simple, it's fast and it's effective. It'll be so at the federal, state and local level. In summary, we had an outstanding close to 2020, and we are not slowing down. We are changing the world one workflow at a time and our vision is really resonating. C-Level executives realize that behind every great experience is a great word flow. Our company is hitting on all cylinders. In 2020, we grew our global workforce by 26% hiring 3,000 people in 25 countries with most hired and on-boarded digitally. We are hiring incredible talent, including some of the greatest minds in the AI industry. Our culture is incredibly strong. Our employee engagement is at historic highs. So too is our employee retention. Our brand is strong. C-suite awareness increased in double-digits. Our innovation pipeline is robust. We delivered 70% more features and innovations on the platform in 2020. Our partner ecosystem is expanding: IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and all the great partners in India and many others have joined the workflow revolution with us. Together, we're bringing the innovation speed of a start-up with the scale and reach of a rapidly growing $5 billion plus pure play SaaS company, and our RPO is nearly double that at $9 billion. We're the only born in the cloud software company to have reached this size with our large scale M&A, and we have a clear path to achieve our $10 billion revenue target. We are also deeply committed to making the world to work better for people to helping our customers succeed. We are deeply committed to making the world work better to. Gina will share more about our focus on elevating our global impact. I'm incredibly proud of our just announced $100 million investment in an impact on benefiting underserved communities. And we're deeply committed to being a leader in building a diverse inclusive workforce in which everyone feels that they belong because diverse teams with an indomitable will to win create great companies. ServiceNow is such a company and we are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. That's our dream, and we will pursue it tirelessly with courage, passion, and conviction. Thank you. Over to you, Gina. Well, thank you very much, Sterling. This is Bill. What you're seeing out there is each industry has its own nuances. For example, in financial services, I talked about security. Obviously, the future of work is a big movement to work from anywhere and certainly enable that modern work environment and do that in a way where people can be onboarded without actually even meeting them, train them appropriately and do the ongoing management of people where they can truly execute their mission and they know all the information and they have all the data to do their job. So this is happening in every industry and it's happened in every geo and each persona has its own unique needs. What we think is unique about ServiceNow is that this platform, think of it as the workflow automation platform, comprehends all the opportunities with App Engine to customize things very rapidly like vaccine management, for example. It also offers the IntegrationHub. And what the IntegrationHub enables is all the things from RPA, process mining, API integration, process analytics, native mobile, contextual interfaces, and all the other things that CIOs and leaders of businesses are counting on to create end-to-end continuity in the business. And that's what makes us so unique. So having that platform advantage and our well-known position in IT is equally as relevant with the employee experience, because now you have one portal with a consumer-grade UX, all the complexity is hidden, all the onboarding caring for the employee is done and they are right off and running with their mission. In some cases, I had one very high-level executive tell me, I haven't met the 5,000 people I hired this year because of the Now Platform. And then on customer service management, in every industry, and I gave the AT&T example as one, you're seeing this frictionless business environment really take off. So how do we deal with the end consumer and do so directly in a way that enables our services to be consumed. So you're seeing this ease of use around ServiceNow, you're seeing the virtual agent guide people through subscription processes, and you're seeing all of our deep machine learning and AI help the customer navigate their sign-on processes and so forth. And the workflow then becomes the exception because humans shouldn't have to get involved in these processes unless the computer didn't get the job done and that gives us such an advantage because we're seeing situations where we can literally consolidate hundreds of systems that our Now Platform take out huge costs, give the customer a great experience and obviously not put so much pressure on human capital because people are only engaged when they're absolutely necessary in the customer satisfaction process. So you're seeing a mass consolidation of all the old stuff to the Now Platform. You're seeing IT employee, customer and all of the App Engine and IntegrationHub opportunities really come together on one common platform, one data model and one architecture. So it's now a solutions company. It's now selling a suite and the broad spectrum of offerings gives us reach to the whole C-level executive team, not just one persona on the executive team. My pleasure, Sterling. Yes. Well, thank you very much, Keith. Maybe I'll start off and then give Gina a chance to build as she wishes on the net new ACV inquiry. First of all, I'll just say that net new ACV on a year-over-year basis will increase and the pipelines that we have in the company and we manage the company on what we call a CEO dashboard in real-time give us much greater coverage than we had last year. So we know that the facts substantiate the net new ACV increase. One of the interesting things that is fascinating is actually our executive briefings have increased 70% on a year-over-year basis. So if you think about our ability to get to the C-suite and increase the contact in this kind of virtual environment, it's actually gone way up. So a lot of people, I guess, need a good meeting and they want to figure out how they're going to digitally transform and the Now Platform has just dynamite tailwind key. Now, in terms of the whole digital landscape, IDC, I think, the $7.4 trillion is very interesting statistic. This is factual. If you just look at the way companies are prioritizing their investments, the one thing that's not going to get deep prioritized is digital transformation and things that enable digital business, because it's really the only way to either get your stuff competitive or to increase your competitive advantage and your peer group, and every CEO completely understand that. And within that context, I think the uniqueness of ServiceNow to have so much, so much momentum, not just in exciting new areas like the future of work with our employee experience or customer service management, which is really a frictionless economy now more and more coming ServiceNow's way, but even in our core with IT. If you look at our ITSM core business, it's outgrown our internal expectations by a lot. And you've seen with the Pro SKU where we add on the machine learning and the AI capabilities on a platform approach that two is growing fast and our engineering team is incredible here. I mean the level of innovation they're pushing out with 70% increase 2020 over 2019 and we have major releases coming this year commensurate with what we did last year. So I wanted to give you a lot of confidence that the net new ACV is going up, the customers are buying and the pipeline is super strong. And here is one thing that I found fascinating. There was a study done by Deloitte. And with all this digital transformation, a lot of executives are looking back and saying, hey, why didn't I get a better return on all I put into digital? And what they found is that about three quarters of the digital transformation projects, didn't give the yielded return on investment that they had hoped for and the number one root cause was integration. So as you think about the Now Platform integrating with 550 systems of record out of the box and all the collaboration tools, no matter which one the customer likes and have that completely synchronized into the Now Platform out of the box and you're up and running in days. It's kind of an attractive value proposition to our customers and even non-customers that want to jump onboard. Yes. I mean, look here's the situation, Keith. We are not against M&A. So far we have done technology tuck-ins or we've done, what I would call, human capital tuck-ins such as we've done with AI. We've gotten tremendous people into the organization to put all the value into the Now Platform and to generate net new revenue growth in the SKUs such as what we did with IT, we'll do with employee, we'll do with customer and obviously we'll do with the low code, no code innovation that we can give to the creator, which is literally a business analyst or anyone that wants to write a low code application in an enterprise. So the way we look at large scale or larger scale M&A, we wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't look at every opportunity to satisfy our customers and our shareholders, but it's important just to register with you that our projection on the 10 billion is clearly in hand with our organic innovation and the momentum we have in the marketplace with our customers, and also the non-customers that want to join the team. So, there's nothing on the table right now for a larger deal, but it's not like we don't have our eyes wide open at the various opportunities. And if they ever presented themselves, you would know that we thought through it rigorously and it was part of our strategic imperative to really do the best we can for our shareholders and our customers. But right now that is not on the table and it's not something that's actionable at this time. Great. And then Raimo, I'll just give you a view for our ITSM Pro because that was your question. First of all, it's growing in steep double-digits, very important. And while we've penetrated 20%, that means we still have 80% to go. So it's a really, really one of the growth opportunity from a shareholder value creation perspective. But what you're looking at is the remote IT services requests growing exponentially, and many of the IT organizations out there are looking for ways to deflect lower-tier cases. So by leveraging chatbots and streamlining processes part of the AI ML capabilities are embedded with our Pro SKU. So that's one aspect of it. And when you start to think about all the innovation that we've built in to this platform and the latest product releases, again the value is so much greater because of the organic innovation the team has put into it. But customers are loving, gee, wow, I can transform IT, which then has an impact on the employee experience and the whole future of work. And incidentally, there isn't a customer out there now that's not asking us to revolutionize their call center operations or enable people to work from a virtual environment better and obviously in this frictionless economy how can I do things with a no-touch or possibly the lowest touch possible, how can I eliminate the middleman in my margin pursuit as companies trying to grow in different industries. All of that requires the IT backbone. So what you're seeing is a multiplying effect of one story compounding into another and really stretching the perimeter of what we're doing for executives across the enterprise. That's why you're seeing deal sizes get larger and larger. You are seeing us be in a very strong position in terms of the product, the value that it delivers, and the processes that we've built for not only pre-sale sale value creation but also post-sale value creation. So ML, AI and the leadership that we've built into this platform is really unique. Thank you very much, Raimo. It's my pleasure, Kash. Thank you very much for your kind remarks. As you think about our company, what's the beauty of us right now is we execute with the speed of a start-up, but we have the scale of a global company. So you're seeing us now expand in Europe quite dramatically. We're hiring amazing, amazing talent. You're seeing us make moves into the Middle East. You're seeing the expansion in Latin America. We're really like starting to kick it into high gear in Asia with an expansion in South Korea. We have lots of plans and we have a well known brand, of course, in Australia, in other more mature markets. In the United States, I feel like we're just getting started based upon the amazing receptivity to this Now Platform. And I think that a lot of that came from our emergency response to COVID and now the vaccine management. And you look at markets and industries like financial services, like telecommunications, like our government business and so many more. So, I would say, we're just getting started in terms of the real extents in for scale. The brand has now become a very well-known brand. The ecosystem tailwind has really kicked in, in the last 12 months. And once you get calls from amazing big brands and they say I have to team up with you, my customers are demanding that I team up with you and integrate beautifully in the Now Platform. My customers are telling me. That's a large telco company. In fact, it's not the one that I mentioned as the example, and they said, we got to do more with you. So you're seeing now a world where the Fortune 2000 gives us an extreme opportunity for growth beyond $10 billion. But our brand and industry and geography and persona, and same account revenue growth and net new logos, which Gina and I also have an operating plan that increases pretty large this year-over-year in addition to the NNACV, net new ACV. So Kash, it's going to be \u2013 look at our four businesses that we already are in, look at every one of them as multibillion opportunities and then don't forget the platform because I think more and more as the citizen developer concept takes off the ServiceNow. It will find this in locations that go way beyond the Fortune 2000. And keep in mind, a lot of those large companies that you mentioned, they might have about 1,000 companies and they say they have a couple of hundred thousand because of all the subsidiaries and so on. So we're talking about real companies with real names. And I think the subsidiaries of those and all peers, the world will really take off as well. We're in the early days here. Thank you, Kash. Yes, sure, absolutely. Well, first of all, I would feature, Walter, the platform itself. And I believe strongly that ServiceNow has now pivoted to be that platform company for digital transformation. And that is a big difference from being, \u201cwhat some used to say was the ERP of IT\u201d. So think about this as a platform company. Think about the core business and the continuous innovation that we're doing in the core to stretch the core into new frontiers. We have a whole organization that is focused on the next big thing. So all the businesses that you would understand well, whether we invented it or someone else did, they all want to cooperate with the Now Platform, because the IntegrationHub enables them to get in. And once they get in, then they can build their imagination and their dreams with ServiceNow. So, I think, there's a big business model in that that we have only scratched the surface on. If you think about employee experience, I think the companies that I talked to including ours, we run someone else's system of record. But if you talk to 13,000 people in ServiceNow, nobody could possibly pick the system of record out of a lineup because all they look at is this gorgeous consumer-grade UI that's driven by the ServiceNow portal, where all the services that they need based on their job profile are right there for them, I mean how big is that market. And the same thing with customer service management. We're learning fast in this new world that we've gone way beyond SFA and up-sells and cross-sells and conditioning that around a marketing campaign. We're into business model innovation, where great companies like Disney or AT&T are rethinking their business model entirely and they're capitalizing on the streaming rage, and they're coming up with subscription business models that reinvent the customer experience and give them net new businesses. ServiceNow is in that to win. And I think that TAM is absolutely unbelievable. The other TAM that's pretty interesting that nobody spends much time talking about, but it's one of the reasons I see ServiceNow's future is so bright. If you just take paper-based processes that are clocking up all of these companies and you digitize them to the Now Platform, there is a well-known bank out there that says the U.S. market alone is a $280 billion market, which maybe globally that's $400 billion market. And then I think this platform business, I really see an amazing, amazing future for the platform business. Just think about this. If you're the state of North Carolina and you're a ServiceNow customer and you've got a vaccine management challenge, like literally in days they can build a custom application tailored to 10 million citizens to get them the vaccine in their arm to protect them from this terrible virus. Again, that is just built on to the Now Platform using the App Engine, the IntegrationHub and all the innovation that our great engineers have built. So, we're at the early days and there are some things that we have planned for that will be forthcoming in the months and year ahead. But right now, I just want to keep you focused on what we're doing, because literally we've only scratched the surfaces of these businesses. Thank you, Walter. Yes, fantastic. So let's start with the whole idea of the partners. There isn't a partner that's a global partner right now that does not have a business plan that's $1 billion or more with ServiceNow. And many of them are in the multiple billions, and they're building their business model. Some of them tell me, they look at the Now Platform as the cross-platform integration engine of their business model with the various other companies, whether it's system of record software company or collaborative software company that they also have partnerships with. But they're looking at us as the center of that digital transformation effort. That is a very, very big tailwind. Many of the net new innovative applications that they will bring to their customers, they're building on the Now Platform because the low-code, no-code simplicity of the platform can enable them to do things at record speeds, and I think that is a big, big unlock for them. So platform is really big. I also think the ML and the AI movement that we're on, Element AI was kind of the finishing touch of four M&A moves that we made, which was really about acquiring not just patents and thought leadership, but real enablement of the Now Platform, so we can truly unleash humanity in ways that heretofore were not possible. And the computer and the human now can do things in terms of decision-making, removing soul-crushing work that nobody really wants to do, issuing workflow orders only when it's necessary because the virtual agent can solve 90% of the problems and most engagement with customers. And this is now like a whole new universe because many of those partners looked at us an IT. And now the employee experience, for example, is one of Deloitte's most desired personas and they're actually extraordinarily good at the employee experience and they give us reach globally and there are others on customer service management now that is saying what we're doing especially with digitizing business processes, ease of use on subscription models, like Disney+. We are so honored to see Disney+ say, that's our digital bridge to the future. We have great core businesses, but this is a digital bridge to the future. And ServiceNow is right in the mix of all of that. So look, it's a once in a generation opportunity, and I'm really, really happy. And I also look at the technology partners that we have now that have just adopted us as the standard for IT and so many other things. We made the announcement on IBM where they basically looked at their ITSM on-premise business and said we got to go to the cloud. We'd rather go to the cloud with you that's where the innovation is and we've won very good partnerships like we're doing with Microsoft, connecting with O365 teams dynamics and bringing a whole new understanding of what's possible with the Now Platform working interdependently with Microsoft. So, all that and more is all in the mix from our growth plan. Thank you very much. Yes, absolutely. Again, we're hiring best-in-class talent. We obviously have extremely bold ambitions to what we think we can do in the customer service management arena. Also, John Ball, who is the gentleman that we hired as you know, he ran the Einstein initiative over another software company in the area. And we feel that he has domain expertise. And when he saw what we were doing in customer service management, he said, this is where I want to work. He said, this is the biggest thing that I've seen. He said I can't get over this NOW Platform, its simplicity, how quickly I can innovate on it. I'll give you an example. He was front and center on the vaccine management innovation. Literally, that whole process took us three weeks where vaccine management as a concept and an application was developed in three weeks and launched to the global marketplace. And it's in Scotland, it's in UK, it's in many states now in the United States. And in the not too distant future, hopefully it's helping many of the federal agencies help the Biden administration save lives here in America and obviously in other parts of the world too. So it's the speed at which you can innovate on this platform. It's the pristine nature of this platform that you don't have to work with multiple different platforms from different M&A moves or different levels of complexity that others have built up over time. Here, it's just like there it is innovate on, it. What's the idea, let's code it and let's get it out to the market. We did emergency response apps, if you remember, over a weekend and we launched them globally in a week. I mean it's just unheard of. And that's what's really exciting that our engineers are spending all of their time coding new innovations as opposed to integrating past applications. Thank you very much, Gregg. Yes, that's the whole point. That's what we're talking about here. I'll give you an example. I had one CEO said to me, hey, I want to get a good score on Glassdoor. And he said there doesn't seem to be an application on the market for it. I said yes why don't you get a business analyst and we'll design a workflow around that, and then you can launch it out into your company in record speed like a couple of days. So, what's unique here in the case of vaccine management as an example, you took the platform and you customized something in a few days basically to vaccinate 5.5 million people. But in the case of something where you just need to flow chart a workflow and rethink a process to, for example, roll out a rewards program or a recognition program that could be done by a business analyst. So we're not inhibited by prepackaged software or doing things that are quite complex in development in the case of the platform because all you need is an idea. And if you have an idea, a business analyst can code on this platform. If you have an idea that's a little bit more complex, you can have a Low-Code situation where somebody with a little bit of computer intelligence skills can navigate this platform. So this is kind of the secret sauce. I tell you, when I think about what it can be because of the architecture and the simplicity of the platform itself, our imaginations just keep getting more and more fulfilled with dreams and excitement. And I'm just so excited by our engineering teams. And Gina and I have made sure that we fund them now appropriately and most of the investments around here go to the great engineers and the people that serve our customers. There's zero bureaucracy in this company, just like there's zero bureaucracy in the platform. Thank you."

            "name": "Gina Mastantuono",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Happy New Year, everyone. I want to start-off by echoing Bill's praise for all the employees of ServiceNow. It has been a year of unprecedented challenges, but the team has remained focused on executing and meeting the needs of our customers. I couldn't be more impressed with our resilience, which is a testament to our great culture here at ServiceNow. And thanks to our people that we delivered another fantastic quarter to cap a strong year. We exceeded the high-end of our subscription revenues and subscription billing guidance, which carried through to strong free cash flow generation. Q4 subscription revenues were $1.184 billion representing 32% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a three-point tailwind from FX. Q4 subscriptions billing were very strong at $1.828 billion representing 41% year-over-year growth and a $183 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. Adjusted growth was 38% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.9 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. And current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth. FX was about a three-point tailwind. The traction we are seeing in our top line results, reflect our focus on meeting the needs of our customers and their employees. As Bill noted, the workflow revolution is underway and is centered around the best experiences. And that's the Now Platform's super power, the ability to deliver workflows that create those great experiences for people. The NOW Platform is playing a critical role in accelerating digital transformation. We're treating our customers as partners, listening and learning about their challenges so we can help solve them. We aren't selling point products. We're providing them with comprehensive solutions with measurable results and quick time to value. Better together, that's the power of our portfolio. It's this attention to our customers' needs that's driving our best-in-class renewal rate of 99%, demonstrating the stickiness of our business as the NOW Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our sales teams continued to win bigger deals in Q4, including our largest deal ever, which is three times the size of our previous largest deal. We closed 89 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter, with average deal sizes up 18% year-over-year. In 2020, we added nearly 700 net new customers, ending the year with almost 6,900 enterprises. The number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 40% in fiscal 2020. Customers are realizing the strategic value of combining ServiceNow IT workflows with everything from HR, CSM and our App Engine to deliver greater value across the enterprise. Our ability to land new logos and expand our existing relationships amid a pandemic, further validate the strength of our platform and the value we're delivering to enterprise C-suite. Turning to profitability, Q4 operating margin was 22%, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance. Year-over-year, our Q4 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental R&D investments and marketing spend on pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, up 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and strong collection. For full year 2020, operating margin was 25%, up 300 basis points year-over-year and free cash flow was 32%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in the business. The highly affected industries we outlined early last year, which represented about 20% of our business, continue to see macro headwinds, but remained resilient. Three of our top 20 deals in the quarter were from highly impacted industries, including retail, automotive and energy. We do expect headwinds in some severely impacted industries to persist in 2021. However, retention of existing customers remains very strong in Q4. Overall, we're entering 2021 with strong secular tailwinds created by a surge in demand for digital transformation. Our pipeline continues to look healthy, and our brand continues to resonate with enterprise leaders. ServiceNow is exceptionally well-positioned to seize this opportunity. We have the unique platform and innovative product suite businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Turning to guidance, for transparency and clarity, I'd like to call out a few items. First, as I noted earlier, we saw $80 million in early payments from customers in Q4, which was an approximately 200 basis point tailwind to full year subscription billings growth in 2020. This results in a more significant headwind of about 350 basis points for 2021 billings growth. To be clear, these early payments have no effect on the timing of revenue. We've also previously talked about how early renewals and success with very large customers were impacting billing cycles as they can add additional volatility to timing and duration. This makes billings a less reliable leading indicator of top-line growth. Given this noise and to provide investors with even greater transparency, we're introducing quarterly cRPO guidance. We believe cRPO will provide better visibility and is a more consistent indicator of business performance, normalizing for timing and duration noise. We will continue to provide billings guidance throughout 2021 as a transition period. Second, the need to digitally transform has been accelerated by the current macro environment, creating a very large opportunity for ServiceNow. With the savings we are recognizing from our more efficient operating environment, we're continuing to invest in R&D and quota-bearing resources to drive innovation and pipeline to fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well-positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration. These investments include those we were making in AI, such as the acquisition of Element AI. Similar to previous investments and successful growth initiatives like our Pro SKUs or geographic expansion, we will be disciplined about our spend. Beyond our business investments, we will also be investing in people and communities. We've always been focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging. And as Bill noted, we recently announced our first ever $100 million investment in a racial equity fund to build equitable opportunity for Black communities. This investment is expected to earn a solid return, while facilitating sustainable wealth creation through homeownership, entrepreneurship and neighborhood revitalization. Finally, COVID cases have been spiking in recent weeks, and some regions have reentered lockdown protocols. While we haven't seen any significant impact on our business, we will continue to monitor and be transparent in our disclosures throughout 2021. With that in mind, for Q1 we expect subscription revenues between $1.275 billion and $1.28 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including a four-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.31 billion and $1.315 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early payments from customers in 2020, our Q1 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of four points. We expect cRPO growth of 32% year-over-year, including a five-point FX tailwind. We expect an operating margin of 25% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we expect subscription revenues between $5.48 billion and $5.5 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a three-point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $6.205 billion and $6.225 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our 2021 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 28% to 29% year-over-year growth. This growth reflects an acceleration in net new ACV in 2021, and it also includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of two points. We expect subscription gross margin of 85%, reflecting some federal and public sector customers moving to our newly launched Azure offering as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. We expect an operating margin of 23.5%, representing 150 basis points expansion off of our pre-COVID 2020 run rate. I would note that this is also an incremental 50 basis points more than the 100 basis points of expansion we target each year. Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. In summary, in 2020, we delivered a combination of both strong top line growth and profitability, an incredible accomplishment in a COVID environment. Our outstanding results continued to demonstrate our strong product portfolio, our focus on building deep customer relationships and our commitment to enabling their digital transformation. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. We are the platform company for digital business. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance and our unrelenting execution in a turbulent year. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. We're well on our way to becoming a $10 billion revenue company on the strength of incredible organic innovation. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions. Sure, Sterling. Thanks for the question. We talked about really continuing to focus on driving a balance of growth and profitability, and I've been pretty transparent and open about those margins. We are currently expecting that a more normalized T&E will come back towards the back-half of 2021. And so the expectations on the front-half will be similar to what we've been seeing, but that we would expect some more normalized T&E to start again in the back-half. I wouldn't add anything more on that. I think that that was a great answer, Bill, on the acceleration of net new ACV. On the M&A conversation, I think, Bill, I know you have a perspective. Sure. So I'll take the first one. So yes, in Q4, we talked about 80 million of billings that were accelerated in Q4 out of Q1 of 2020. And so basically if you take that 80 out of Q4 and put it back into 2020 \u2013 and put it back into 2021 that's where you see that double impact, right. And so, you might take it out of 2020 and add it back into 2021. And so it's about a 200 basis point tailwind to 2020, but then about 350 basis headwind in 2021. So we try to do all the math for you, so that's pretty clear. And just to be clear that these were early customer payments. And we feel like it's one time in nature, and it was really results of our customers having excess cash driven by the OpEx savings that we said they were seeing in 2020. And so, I hope that that clarifies you, Raimo. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ms. Lisa Banks, Senior Vice President of Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nLisa Banks: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our third quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020 and full year of 2020. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of October 28, 2020 and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impacts of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including but not limited to, the timeframes for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on customer's purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycles, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and MD&A in our SEC filings, including our 2019 10-K and our 10-Q that will be filed for Q3 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We also like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We continue to be ServiceNow strong in support of our employees and communities in these challenging times. We also remain passionately focused on delivering for our customers, partners and shareholders. 2020 has brought unimaginable change to the world. Companies have to operate in new and faster ways, pivoting their business models. Everyone is adapting to new employee and customer expectations. It's all about people. Getting teams to collaborate across the enterprise is now more important than ever. The workplace of the future will be distributed. Managing complex digital workflows will be critical. Enterprises need innovation without disruption. It's clear that speed has become the differentiator. ServiceNow is leading this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make work better for people. And this is what we're seeing. All value chains are being split apart. They are being reformed into modern digital workflows across the enterprise. More than $3 trillion have been invested in digital transformation initiatives. But as IDC research shows us, only 26% of the investments have delivered meaningful ROI. Massive investments is simply not creating massive change. This is fueling the workflow revolution. The missing link is integration. Systems, silos, departments and processes must come together into holistic cross enterprise workflows. The Now Platform unlocks this ROI by offering speed, agility and resilience. Companies need it now. It gives companies the ability to deliver at scale the experiences employees and customers demand. That's the power of the Now Platform, a single architecture and data model that serves the enterprise platform or all other platforms. In other words, it's the platform of digital business. As one CIO said to me, \"My goal with the Now Platform is to enable my colleagues to perform their top 50 tasks in a single environment that provides a consumer like experience.\" The momentum of the workflow revolution is unstoppable. Despite the COVID operating environment, our team delivered outstanding Q3 results. Gina will provide the details. Here are the headlines. We beat expectations across the board. We surpassed 1,000 customers with ACV over $1 million. We landed our largest deal ever with our largest customer, who has now crossed over $40 million in ACV, and we are raising full year guidance today. We're driving sustainable growth well on our way to $10 billion and beyond. I'm incredibly proud of our team. In the most challenging of times, we are focused, disciplined, committed to helping our customers succeed above other priorities. The speed at which we're innovating has never been faster. Our team is leading the future of work. We are releasing new innovations every two weeks with our Safe Workplace Suite, to help our customers safely return their employees back to the workplace. Other new product introductions include hardware asset management, financial services operations, telecom service management, legal service delivery, workplace service delivery and connected operations. I could go on. In addition, our platform innovations are differentiated for the direct-to-consumer industry where subscribers demand flawless customer service. One of the largest streaming services in the world seamlessly upgraded their ServiceNow environment this past weekend with zero downtime. There was no impact to any of their active subscribers. How's that for customer service? Such innovation demonstrates the power of the Now Platform. We were honored in Q3 to be named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise low code application platforms. We believe this is yet another example of the agility of the Now Platform to help customers quickly workflow any challenge. We think our Gartner recognition validates the breadth of our IT solutions, putting ServiceNow in a leader position in the two 2020 Magic Quadrants, IT risk management and IT Vendor risk management tools. And of course, we remain the leader on both completeness of vision and highest and ability to execute for our ITSM core business - amazing. Now let's look at Q3 performance, highlights across our portfolio. Here we go. Our top 20 deals included three or more products. Our core remains ever strong. ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals with customers choosing ITSM Pro in 16 deals. The embedded AI and machine learning capabilities are helping IT organization scale and automate, reduce complexity, cost and risk, while enabling people to work from anywhere. ITOM was included 18 of the top 20 deals. We won deals with Mount Sinai and the federal Defense Information Systems Agency. Our customer workflows continue to be a growth driver, 13 of the top 20 deals included CSM, 8 of those deals were greater than $1 million. Our customer wins in Q3 demonstrate how ServiceNow is becoming the enterprise workflow standard. For example, Q3 was our largest federal quarter ever. We now have nine federal customers over $10 million in ACV. Deals included the US Air Force, US Army and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. And we have new customer wins with agencies, such as the US Senate and Federal Claims Court. In our largest deal ever, the Department of Veteran Affairs is modernizing its enterprise service management and IT capabilities. They are using the Now Platform to have real-time visibility into the health, availability and costs of their critical business services. This will deliver significant benefits to our heroic veterans. With ITSM Pro, VA will automate its manual workflows with AI and machine learning capabilities to free up employees to better serve veterans. As the US Air Force has publicly described, they are deploying the Now Platform as part of their digital Air Force of the future vision. We are helping them deliver Genius Bar like self-help services to the women and men serving our country around the globe. In addition to federal, state governments also are leveraging the Now Platform. Tennessee's Department of Human Services expanded its relationship with ServiceNow. They're using CSM to reopen state offices for public services while keeping health and safety a priority. They quickly adopted our latest Now Platform, Paris release, utilizing the new feature that enables the public to self schedule appointments and digitally check-in when arriving for appointments. The State of Alaska's Governor issued a directive to protect workers and ensure that the state can continue operating in a pandemic environment. Their existing systems, manual processes and dispersed population created numerous issues to work effectively. The HR department is transitioning to a centralized operating model, and ServiceNow will solve their manual onboarding issues and enable employee workflows to be digitally transformed. Outside of federal and state, and customers across industries, the Now Platform is the standard for driving enterprise digital transformation. 2020 has bought significant changes to Dell's work-from-home model. Our HR product will support this new way of working by providing enterprise onboarding and transitions, and the Now Platform is helping Dell in its mission to provide the best customer experience in the markets they serve. Leading managed services provider, TPX, became the first customer of our new telecom industry specific product. ServiceNow is going to run TPX's customer portal, enabling onboarding, project management, customer servicing and IT support. A major Indian financial institution chose ServiceNow to give them complete visibility to better control enterprise risks, replacing legacy solutions that were stitched together. This is another example of the movement we are seeing in the industry to replace legacy solutions and consolidate on the Now Platform, huge savings. In Q3, we continued to see strong momentum with our Safe Workplace Suite of apps. This quarter we added two new apps into the state Workplace Suite, employee travel safety and health and safety testing. Our Safe Workplace apps demonstrate our ability to innovate quickly and deliver their time to value in weeks, not months and years. We've seen nearly 800 downloads of our Safe Workplace apps. Customers include Standard & Poor's Raymond James and Rutgers University. At Rutgers, our Safe Workplace apps are being used for health screening, contact tracing and room reservations, to ensure a safe environment for all students and faculty. Here is my favorite customer win. I'm a huge basket ball fan, as many of you know, my grandfather Bobby McDermott was a Hall of Famer. So I couldn't be more proud of how ServiceNow helped pro basketball have a successful restart season. The NBA and WNBA were able to implement ServiceNow's employee workflows in under a week to manage the complex manual processes associated with restarting. ServiceNow helped league facilitate screening for more than 2,600 lead staff, vendors and guests who entered the NBA and WNBA bubble in Florida and successfully processed more than 13,000 essential documents. Using ServiceNow technology, the league demonstrated that a safe, careful return to professional sports was possible with the right tools and protocols in place. We are very proud to become the official workflow partner of the NBA and WNBA, and we look forward to helping the league continue to drive digital transformation to deliver great employee, player and fan experiences. As we drive great customer wins, our partner ecosystem is growing even stronger. We are grateful for the investments our partners are making to grow their ServiceNow businesses and to serve our customers. We recently announced a go-to-market partnership between IBM and ServiceNow. This new business opportunity combines ServiceNow ITSM and ITOM capabilities with IBM's Watson AIOps to help customers automate IT at scale, reducing cost and risk. Last week, we announced an expanded partnership with Accenture. The new Accenture ServiceNow Business Group will accelerate digital transformation programs for customers in telecom, government, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and life sciences. In summary, Q3 was another great outperformed quarter. ServiceNow is accelerating. We are confident in our ability to succeed in this environment. We are bullish on our long-term outlook and our path to $10 billion and beyond. Our leadership has expanded our reach and opportunities with marquee partnerships such as the NBA and WNBA, IBM and Accenture. There are many more. Our brand is resonating. We are becoming an essential C-suite strategic partner. Our ecosystem is growing fast. Our go-to-market capabilities are stronger than ever. Our product innovation is second to none. We are deeply committed to attracting, retaining and developing the best talent in this industry. We are a big tent company dedicated to diversity, inclusion and belonging. Diversity makes us stronger, making ServiceNow the destination company where the best talent belongs and thrives. And this is what's going to make us unstoppable. Our new Board member and new Chief Global Talent Officer were announced today, and it demonstrates the caliber of people we are attracting. I could not be more thrilled to have Larry Jackson joining our board and Gaby Toledano joining our leadership team. Both are exceptional leaders. Larry is leading a music industry revolution for Apple Music. His experience using technology to create innovative market leading consumer experiences will be invaluable as we drive innovative employee and customer experiences to the global marketplace. Likewise, Gaby brings deep-tech industry and talent leadership experience building world-class organizations at scale for some of the best-known companies in the world. We were humbled to recently be recognized as the company with the best leadership team in an anonymous survey of more than 10,000 employees across the industry. Gaby is a great addition who will only make us stronger. In so many ways, we are just getting started. This year's unprecedented headwinds have only strengthened our digital transformation tailwinds. We have the platform businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation, the missing link for integration of existing technology investments and the creation of modern enterprise workflows. Remember, behind every great experience is a great workflow. Whatever challenge a business is facing, we workflow it, we will make workflow a verb. ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We will not slow down in pursuit of this goal. We couldn't be more fired up to finish this year very strong. And now I will turn the call over to our outstanding CFO, and my friend, Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a fantastic quarter for ServiceNow as the team continued to execute very well despite the challenges created by COVID-19. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, and that top line beat carried through to a robust operating margin and strong free cash flow generation. Q3 subscription revenues were $1.091 billion, representing 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. Q3 subscription billings were $1.081 billion, representing 24% year-over-year adjusted growth, driven by the great execution from our sales team. Remaining performance obligations or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $7.3 billion, representing 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, and current RPO was approximately $3.8 billion, representing 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. Our top-line strength demonstrates the power of our product portfolio and our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. The Now Platform is uniquely positioned to deliver exceptional time to value and provide workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees, and partners. We are solving customer's challenges and playing a key role in accelerating their digital transformation. The Now Platform enables the missing integrations that links together system, silos, departments, and processes into unified workflows. Our best-in-class renewal rate improved quarter-over-quarter to 98%, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers operations. As Bill highlighted, our sales teams continue to win bigger deals in Q3, including our largest ever $13 million ACV deal. We closed 41 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter. And what's more, nine of those are with net new customers. Our ability to land new logos despite the macro uncertainty that COVID has introduced is a testament to our amazing products and our brand that continues to resonate with the C-suite. We now have over 1,000 customers paying us more than $1 million of ACV. Turning to profitability, Q3 operating margin was 26%, a 400 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance, lower T&E expenses as a result of COVID and about 150 basis points of marketing spend that shifted from Q3 into Q4. Year-over-year, our Q3 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental investments in R&D and marketing spend of pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 19%, up 500 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and CapEx in the quarter as well as strong collections. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing in our business. Overall, we see strong momentum heading into the last quarter of the year. The highly affected industries we outlined earlier in the year, which represented about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality, retail and energy, continue to see macro headwinds, but remain steady customers of ServiceNow. We closed six new deals over $1 million in these affected industries. And while we do expect some headwinds in severely impacted industries like airlines, renewals of existing customers have remained very strong. Furthermore, we've also seen very healthy payment terms and DSOs. Collections have been strong, helping drive free cash flow upside in Q3, and we expect that trend to continue into Q4. Enterprises are realizing that they need to quickly adapt to the workplace of the future, and ServiceNow is providing a smarter and faster way to workflow. Our pipeline generation has remained robust, and our pipeline coverage ratio for the remainder of the year gives us confidence in our ability to deliver a strong finish to 2020. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenues range to between $4.257 billion and $4.262 billion, representing 31% year-over-year constant currency growth. We are raising our subscription billings range to between $4.78 billion and $4.8 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year adjusted growth. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, and we are raising our full-year 2020 operating margin from 24% to 24.5%. This reflects additional savings from lower T&E expenses related to COVID. Let me note that while we expect many of these expenses to return at some point in the future, we're taking our learnings from the current environment and leaning into the future of work. These learnings will have lasting effects on our overall efficiency, giving us the ability to redeploy savings elsewhere. We plan to take advantage of the incremental leverage and make disciplined investments for growth. We're reinvesting in R&D and quota bearing resources to drive innovation and pipelines that fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration heading into 2021 and beyond. Turning to free cash. We are raising our full-year 2020 free cash flow margin 200 basis points from 29.5% to 31.5%, reflecting the increase in our operating margin and our expectations for better than originally forecasted collections for the year. Turning to Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.155 billion and $1.160 billion, representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $1.625 billion and $1.645 billion, representing 24% to 26% year-over-year adjusted growth Moving on to profitability. For Q4, we expect a 21% operating margin, which includes about 150 basis points of marketing spend that shifted from Q3 into Q4 and some incremental investment into pipeline generating activities to set us up for a strong and successful 2021. Finally, we expect fourth quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 201 million and 199 million respectively. In summary, ServiceNow is the strategic workflow authority. As enterprises are adapting to the workplace of the future, CXO's are using the Now Platform to create new workflows for new value chains, transforming experiences across siloed systems and functions across the enterprise. The Now Platform is the missing integration layer that multiplies the power of enterprises existing technology investments and delivers exceptional time to value. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance as we focus on addressing these needs for our customers. Our ecosystem partners are efficiently expanding our capabilities and our reach, and more and more enterprises are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. We are the platform company for digital business. I'm very excited about the traction we are seeing in our journey towards becoming a $10 billion revenue company and the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for your dedication during these trying times. We know everyone has a lot going on in their lives, juggling work and caring for your families at home, and we just want to express how appreciative we are of your contributions. ServiceNow wouldn't be in the position of strength it is without each and every one of you. You make us ServiceNow. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Bill, a slightly bigger picture question. Now that we are living in this normal environment of kind of working from home, demand generation in a different way than we had before, what lessons have you learned so far in terms of like how this new world is going to function now in terms of you planning for the coming years in terms of sales hiring, lead generation, etc.? Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, I appreciate it, Raimo. First of all, we're learning that digital transformation is actually accelerating in the COVID environment. It is however a platform game. So you need to have the platform that can truly make the difference. And we see workflow as the new productivity unlock. When you look at IDC, talking about where it's thoroughly invested and system of record kind of change. You see system of action taking on a whole new meaning now in the information technology industry, which puts us in a very nice position in any environment. So I think what happens here is COVID accelerated digital transformation. Now that people are into it, they've got to keep going as fast as they possibly can. Our direct sales force is every bit as relevant as ever before, and we are continuing to make sure the coverage model expands geographically by industry and also persona. You can also complement this very nicely with an inside selling motion to both support existing accounts and pursue net new logos. You're going to be in an environment where you can do events. These events do not have to be done in big stadiums with thousands of people. You can do them digitally and have techniques where you bring live experiences into the event. That also gives a growth company like ServiceNow the ability to take some of that T&E and put it into revenue strategies for future growth. So we're super excited super, super confident about our ability to execute in this environment, because as you know, Raimo, the future of work is now totally different than it was eight months ago. And thank goodness we leaned into that when we did in March and started a revolution.\nOperator: Your next question is from Samad Samana.\nSamad Samana: Bill, I wanted to maybe touch on the federal strength and even the state and local governments. It seems like you're seeing an acceleration in transformation there as well. And I'm curious how much of the strength there was driven by modernizing existing processes or old processes versus kind of near-term pandemic driven spend on dealing with like monitoring PP&E or contact tracing, etc.?\nBill McDermott: Yes, I believe, you know, as I said, what happened with digital transformation might have been accelerated by COVID. But the fact is, I think it brought everything to light. When people had to work in a distributed way, work from home, all of the technology needs that they have, the communications needs that they have, the self-service needs that they have, all of these things became extremely clear in a COVID environment. And now that that environment is clear, if you read the research, clearly we're never going to go back to the way things were even after the pandemic is resolved. So the future of work is changing. The millennial generation is changing. The way people work will change. And as it relates to the federal government, it's a big opportunity because the information that's required to get across the country to citizens is very slow. So the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing digital services. So these workflow services are going to be here for a long time because there's a lot of things to fix. So we are in a - in an environment now where I think the genie is out of the bottle. It's never going back in, and digital transformation is going to continue to accelerate. And yes, we do have return to work, but that hasn't been the major source of the revenue drive in federal, state and local, it's really been more automating and rethinking work processes and automating everything in a much more human-friendly way.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Bill, I was just wondering if you could give us some idea of when you're going into these big deals, you obviously - the economic backdrop is still choppy. So your customers are having to make decisions about maybe bringing budgets from other areas and sort of giving it to you or allowing you to earn it, I guess. What's going on in those conversations? Are you taking budget from other areas - from other vendors? Is this - are these dollars that used to be spent on more antiquated business processes that you are now able to sort of pull together? Yes, I'm just trying to get a sense, because if you take a larger view of what's going on, obviously this is still a difficult economic backdrop. But you all are clearly taking wallet share and just would love some more color on that. Thanks.\nBill McDermott: It's my pleasure. So the bottom line, Kirk, if you think about it, the future of work in terms of the employee experience. It's clear now that one portal that can provide all the services that employees need, from on-boarding on an employee to self-serving all of their cases to training them and creating a segment of one learning journey for them, to managing issues that might resolve - that might come up and need to be resolved across multiple functions. All of these things are workflow related. So I think the future of work has truly accelerated the consumer strength of our application because it's so easy to use. It's so beautiful to use, people love it. And we hide all the complexity of what's been created over the last half-century. In terms of the customer experience, the customers today, especially in the digital world, expect companies to give them great service. And the kind of the SFA of the past, how do I upsell and cross sell you, they're not in a good mood for that. What they really want is they want you to give them a great service in terms of whatever they signed up for and then make all the self-help tools available to them and use AI to automate the experience. And then if you do need human intervention, the workflow process itself should initiate a call order to a bot or to a human to resolve something so that the customer gets what they want, and they get a digitally. And you know Netflix taught us this. Disney+ taught us this. This is the new way that customers want to work, and they're not in a mood for an up-sell or a cross-sell when they're calling it to have a problem resolved or they are trying to get a service initiated. And similarly, big companies have a direct-to-consumer headset, right now. It's kind of like, hey, the middle people I used to work through, wholesalers, retailers, etc. aren't open. So I've got to go direct to my consumer with my brand and my product and create a great experience. All of this is workflow. So the changes in the future work are going to be there. But then you could take a large bank. I had a CIO extraordinaire in with our Board, and she talked about retiring 283 legacy applications and converging them all on the Now Platform. And there's a list of another 100, and she basically told a great story about literally thousands of people working from everywhere and getting them all their tools and procedures and allowing them to navigate in this world on their own in a way that's highly pleasing to them because they want to drive productivity with their workforce. They also want to mitigate risk and have controls in place, so the place is run well. And everything now is just running so much better. They took out all these 283 systems, and they delivered like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars by application that they retired. And when you add it all up, it's in the triple-digit millions. So they are saving huge money.\nOperator: And your next question is from Karl Keirstead of UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Maybe I'll direct this one to Gina. Gina, on the margin improvement trajectory, it seems like there is a band we should be thinking about. Maybe at the low end, the pre-COVID rate, at which ServiceNow was improving margins at about 100 basis points a year and perhaps at the high end, the roughly 300 basis points that you're going to put up in 2020 which is probably somewhat unsustainable. I wanted to ask whether your comments about upticking investments was intended to perhaps push us to one end of that spectrum. I'm not asking for firm guidance. I know that will probably come later, but just directionally maybe how this experience with COVID and the cost structure has changed, if at all, your view of ServiceNow's margin improvement story?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So thanks for the question Carl. It's a great question, and I was trying to give some - I was trying to elaborate here, right, so the 300 basis point of margin improvement that you're seeing this year as you said it is not sustainable, right. Some of these costs will return and what we wanted to say is that not all of them will at the same level. Right. And so we absolutely will be leaning into the future of work and what that means from a cost perspective, but we don't plan to just rest on our laurels. And as Bill talked about the acceleration of digital transformation really being at the forefront and really making sure that we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth and really remain market leader, we will absolutely continue to invest to ensure that we are well positioned in the view of that exploration happening. And so more will come on the absolute margin guide. But I wanted to make clear that the 300 basis points is not sustainable, and that certainly some of the learnings and efficiencies that we'll see in a post pandemic world will be redeployed in areas such as R&D and in quota bearing resources to really kick start growth.\nKarl Keirstead: And if I could ask a follow-up to Bill. Bill it's now been pretty well a year since you were announced as the new CEO of ServiceNow, congrats by the way on that anniversary. And I'm just wondering now that you're getting comfortable in the seat, the execution has been strong. Perhaps, it's time that M&A becomes a bigger lever to move ServiceNow in the direction you'd like. I'd love your thoughts on that. Thank you very much.\nBill McDermott: Well, Karl, thank you very much. You know it's been a year. It's been amazing. I love it here, and the workforce, the partners, the customers, the satisfaction, the loyalty, the excitement on Net Promoter Score, everything is just so positive. And the culture here is so committed, and I think that has really jelled very well with my DNA. So I'm just honored to be here and having the time of my life. As it relates to M&A, we have a situation here where the core business - and the core business has so much potential in and of itself, and the platform has so much potential in and of itself. And when you extend that to the employee experience and some of the items I mentioned today and then you also think about the workforce and the workforce of the future and all the experience layers that go along with that and what ServiceNow will do for people and we're going to make people and their lives so much better in the enterprise. Then you think about customer service management and the enormous success we're having with customer service management and the huge TAM of customer service management. We just have so much opportunity organically that you have to think about geographies. You have to think about industries. You have to think about the personas we're going to serve. And when you put it all together, I mean, depending on what research you look at - Morgan Stanley when I first came in here had just taking paper-based processes and enterprises and automating them into workflows was $228 billion in the US. So if you extrapolate that to the world, you could easily get to $400 billion just in that. If you think about the employee experience, the CSM, the core business, now with ML and AI and all the operational efficiencies, so much organically. So I think the tuck-in strategy has worked well for us because we've been able to re-platform all of that code to the Now Platform. We have no tech debt. Many companies who have expanded through acquisition now have a mess on their hands that they're spending engineering time reintegrating them all the time, instead of building that amortization. So we're very thoughtful about what we're doing here and why we're doing it in service to the customers. So long and short of it is, it's an organic growth story. There's plenty of room to grow. The TAM is big, and if we did something on a more sizable scale, we would have very clear guard rails on doing that for the customer's interests and the large expansion opportunity. But we would never take away the experience benefits they're getting from the Now Platform.\nOperator: Your next question is from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Bill, a question for you and then one for Gina. Definitely feel your excitement about the kind of workflow space, but it does seem like there's a lot of other vendors that are trying to converge on this opportunity as well and trying to automate people's workflows and perhaps a different competitive set or environment than ServiceNow has seen historically. Can you give us your perspective on sort of who are the main competitors for the big vision of ServiceNow? Who are the guys that you really are going out there and duking it out with to get those big deals done?\nBill McDermott: Keith, that's the amazing thing, you know, we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So if you think about the large system of record providers out there, we have no quarrel with them. Most of the CEOs and technology leaders out there have invested heavily in those platforms. And the last thing they're interested in doing right now is switching out those platforms, especially in a COVID environment where speed, acceleration resiliency and serving customer and employees at the top of their to-do list. So that's not a problem for us. And then if you think about the point solution providers, of course there's always going to be point solution providers running around, but we became the platform standard for workflow automation. And now we've extended the perimeter into the employee and the customer service management areas, which are huge TAMs. Also as Gartner indicated, we're really gaining tremendous traction on the platform itself, where people are building innovation onto the platform. So what I see happening is large companies in the Fortune 2000 are basically taking legacy, and they're putting it on to Now. They're basically saying how can retire my legacy because I can go to ServiceNow, get a consumer grade experience, and I can automate my workflows across domains, systems, silos and give my employees and the customers a great experience. And that's so important to them, they don't even ask about price as much as they ask about how quickly can you get it done. And then when we tell them how quickly we can get it done, they are literally in awe because we're talking weeks. We don't talk in years, and that's a very different language from most large-scale companies. So I would really tell you there is no competitor that we go into these large deals worried about. We're just focused on the customer, getting their business to run and do it well. And then obviously we have all the tools, processes and people in place to show them the value. And we not only show them what's possible, but we manage the value through the life cycle of the relationship at an art form level. And these are plays that have been put into the ServiceNow playbook in the last year that are scaling very, very nicely and the customer can see what they're getting out of the platform, and they like it.\nKeith Weiss: Got it, got it. And then for Gina, the confidence you guys have in the business, you guys are definitely expressing on the conference call, but also in hiring. If I got my math right, I think head count is up something in the order by 27% on a year-on-year basis. So definitely investing behind this opportunity, two questions for you. One is that level of growth sustainable for ServiceNow on a going-forward basis or should we expect that to moderate? And two, just given the dynamics of the subscription model where revenues kind of follow the trend of subscription billings and billings overall, are there some margin implications to that type of growth that we should be keeping in mind as we think about 2021?\nGina Mastantuono: Great question, Keith. So I appreciate it. So, yes, you're right in your numbers. Head count is up significantly. We made the pledge that we were not going to lay off this year in the COVID-environment, and not only that, but we were actually going to continue to grow our headcount pretty aggressively year-over-year, especially in R&D and in sales. And so we have done just that, and we will continue to do that. With respect to trends, we are really focused on hiring 9s and 10s in this organization. And the announcements that we've made on new leadership has been fantastic. And we're really getting high-quality high-caliber talent. People want to come work for ServiceNow, and we are just so thrilled about that. And so, yes, I absolutely believe that this trend will continue that we will grow headcount. From a margin perspective, I said earlier, it's a bit too early to comment on '21. Certainly the 300 basis points that we're seeing this year is not sustainable, and we absolutely will be very focused and disciplined in all our investments, including headcount, to ensure that we're driving the right level of ROI, but at the same time really investing behind growth and innovation.\nBill McDermott: Yes, Keith, and one of the things to build on what Gina's saying, we pretty much have so many people trying to work with ServiceNow, and we're very honored by that. But you got to really thread the needle to get in here. So what we're putting into the company is sustainable, and we'd rather have a job open for an extended period of time rather than settle on talent. So we're going to build a great, great company here. The other thing I want to mention to you is the margin profile is also substantiated by revenue per employee. And if you look at our revenue per employee and how it's climbed and how it's climbed against any comparison you can come up with in the enterprise, it's pretty impressive. And Gina and I study that very carefully, and we want to make sure that our shareholders have total visibility into all the things that we're doing. And we also run the whole company on the Now Platform. So we are getting tremendous efficiencies out of that, that are being reinvested into people. And I think that's a big thing, and we're really focused on the engineering pride of the company. We make great, great products, and we provide great service with those products, and the brand obviously is resonating. But in addition to that, where we put the money is on things that will return for the shareholders, so in the form of revenue and sustained revenue, in addition to the margin. So we're really, really focused on the whole P&L right now.\nKeith Weiss: Yes, ServiceNow's unit economics are really best-in-class. So we definitely take notice of the efficiency with which you guys make those investments and the greater returns so. Great job, guys. Thank you very much.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Your next question is from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: A question for you, Bill, and then a follow-up for Gina. Bill, obviously given your background, scaling go-to-market large application platform companies, now that you've been at ServiceNow for three-plus quarters, how do you think about the opportunity that ServiceNow has not just simply to sell deeper into the organizations, but as you mentioned, you acquire new customers? How do you think about sort of balancing that opportunity? And then, Gina, sort of as follow up that in terms of just go-to-market capacity. Obviously, you've added a lot of go-to-market heads this year, what are you seeing in terms of just ramp of those new heads, especially doing so in a virtual environment?\nBill McDermott: Yes, so Phil, I'm really excited to have crossed the year here. We crossed that threshold which is great. In terms of building the go-to-market machine here. It's an outstanding business because the business was built on Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. And when you have a baseline of very, very happy customers that love the product and are having a great experience, it's a lot easier to scale an organization. So I start with that, in total respect of the great engineering and outstanding go-to-market folks that we have in the company that deeply care about customer satisfaction and loyalty, and that baseline has enabled us to focus. I'd say we're focusing very carefully, Phil, on the Global 2000. We are now geographically expanding in Asia. We also have several places within EMEA that we can expand, and we're on top of that. And we're also segmenting things much more by industry now because as you know, when you have an industry solution it's easily replicated in other parts of the world in and other accounts. So we're very good with large customers getting success and then fast replication of that success. And the value that that delivers is something that's still a tailwind, and there's plenty of room to grow. Furthermore, I do agree that that works especially well in a COVID environment on a same account revenue growth basis. And then there is a whole new motion that we have for the net new logo expansion of the company, and that will nicely complement the direct sales force. So there are several indirect techniques that we're putting into place. And just to let all shareholders know that we're thinking about this stuff in our sleep too, we want to make sure that things that we used to do that, perhaps because of COVID or we came up with a better idea even after COVID, is going to be invested in things that give us growth and do so with high efficiency. So we're covering the board geographically, by industry, by persona. It's a direct game. The focus is on the 2000. But we can also go down market with a lot of self-service techniques and insider techniques that we've yet to fully form, and they are now in place, and we think they'll hit the ground running in '21, Phil.\nGina Mastantuono: And then on your second question with respect to sales efficiency and ramp reps, I've been extremely impressed, Phil, with the sales team's ability to close large deals on the move. As we mentioned, we closed 41 deals greater than $1 million in ACVs this quarter. On a sequential basis, we actually saw an improvement in sales productivity, with the most notable uptick coming from North America. Attrition rates remain low, almost at the lowest rates we've seen in quite a long time. And so we're entering into '21 with ramps reps that are significantly higher than at this time last year. So we feel really good about sales productivity, about the ramp reps. And of course ramping new employees in a virtual environment we use the Now Platform. And so our on-boarding platform and product has just been phenomenal, and so the 27% growth that you've seen this year in total heads, we've been onboarding the bulk of those folks remotely in a COVID environment. And it's been flawless. I've actually had a couple hires that were so impressed with how easy it was to onboard. And so really, really proud of the entire team.\nOperator: Your next question is from Derrick Wood of Cowen & Company.\nDerrick Wood: And I'll echo my congrats. I guess for Bill or Gina, I know you guys don't disclose net revenue retention rates. But I'm just curious if you look outside of the distressed verticals you talk about how would you characterize how expansion rates have trended this year versus what you saw pre-COVID? And then as a follow-up, as you enter your strongest renewal quarter in Q4, can you talk about the focus and the demand for ITSM Pro and maybe give us a sense as to what inning you think we're in, in terms of penetrating the installed base?\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks. Yes. Great, I'll take that. Listen, I think that our expansion rates have been really holding up well, similar to what we've seen pre-COVID, so really strong, happy with what we're seeing, even with respect to the distressed verticals. I talked about those deals greater than $1 million in the year - I'm sorry, in the quarter, holding up really strong. And so we feel really good about expansion rate. We feel really good about even our significance in these distressed verticals, right. We are seeing more upsells than down-sells. And so again, feel really good about that. If you talk about the demand for ITSM Pro, well, it continues to be going well and really strong - we continue to have a strong quarter. In Q3, we had great strength. We saw increases in automation and operational resiliency within the product. As we've talked about before, there's a 25% price uplift from ITSM Pro, and 15% of our customers are using it today. So there's significant runway still ahead of us with respect to the Pro SKU. And so, again in summary, really doing well. Customers are resonating as the AI and ML capabilities that are incremental in the Pro SKU are really resonating right now more than ever as you think about the future of work in this COVID environment. And so still early innings with a lot of runway to go.\nBill McDermott: And Derek, one thing to build Gina's commentary on the pipeline. If you look at our pipeline in a snapshot. This time last year our pipeline is up this year versus last year, and even when - if you want to play what-if game, the distressed industry has got harder hit, do you have enough coverage on the conversion side? We have more than enough. So we've already gone through all that, and the retention has been outstanding, including in the distressed industries, and the pipeline overall is substantially strong, and the loyalty actually went up this quarter versus last. So the business is a really good shape.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brad Zelnick.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent, thanks so much for fitting me in. I want to follow up on Keith's question around headcount because I noticed the exception was in professional services. And, Bill, I don't think anyone has the kind of experience and relationships with the global SIs as you do. So can you give us an update on these relationships, the joint investments you're making and the kind of partner leverage that we should expect to see out of the business going forward?\nBill McDermott: Yes, this is such a good question. If you think about a partner like EY as an example, if you talk to Carmine - ServiceNow - I met him in Santa Clara year ago on the ServiceNow platform, bringing his whole team. And we were one of the partners. We were one of the companies, and now it's us and Microsoft as his two most strategic global partners. If you think about Accenture, I talked about Julie at Accenture today. Accenture's now opened up a global practice dedicated with complete passion and investment. If you look at IBM, IBM had a very large on-premise, their version of ITSM on-premise legacy. And they've entered into a big partnership with us to actually move that to the ServiceNow cloud. We team up with them on their Watson AIOps, everybody wins. But best of all, now IBM has committed to a large scale ServiceNow practice. And this is also true with all the other signature partners that you're well aware of. So what happened, what has changed? There isn't a single partner out there that doesn't have at least a $1 billion, if not many more billion vision for what they will do with ServiceNow in the very near future. They are all increasing their investment. They're all looking at ServiceNow as a standard for digital transformation, and they all see either ServiceNow as the cross platform integration engine to straighten out the way companies run and also complement their other practices. Or they're looking at it as a pure net new workflow revolution practice on some of the dimensions that Gina and I discussed today. In all cases, it is really getting tremendous tailwind, and it's one of the network effects that I think is coming from building great products, having tremendous engineering pride, and also lining up a company only with customer satisfaction. I mean, that's really what we care about. And the partners have really resonated with that because when you work with ServiceNow, you don't have situations where you're cleaning up product messes, you have situations where ServiceNow complements their practice. It works, everybody is happy with it. How do we scale? That's the conversation.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome, Bill. If I could just squeeze one in for Gina. I just wanted to ask about the COVID assumptions that you have baked into the Q4 guide, because if I look at what you were saying a quarter ago, you would assume that the most significant headwinds would occur in Q2 and Q3 and that, as it relates to COVID, and that into Q4 the economy would be opening up more broadly. Now if I look at the Safe Harbor in the deck that you have out there today, it instead says that the assumptions are based on information available to us today. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about - is this in your mind a headwind relative to what your assumptions were a few months ago because we're seeing - I know this is changing and evolving very rapidly, but even today with France shutting down. How are you thinking about this?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, it's a great question. As you know, right, so that the uptick in cases and France closing down is certainly a key - key on all of our minds, right, not just from a business perspective. But what I will say is that as you saw the guide, we're actually raising our guide for Q4. And so we definitely took a cautious approach in our - all of our assumptions back at the end of March, and we continue to refine them as we go. What gives me confidence right now in our current Q4 guide is our pipeline stats, right. The coverage is better than last year. Our close rates are strong. And so we continue to be able to evolve and close deals in this remote environment. And so if you think about where we were back in March, April, May, the whole world basically locked down. We feel confident that we'll be able to really continue to hit our numbers and have a strong close to 2020 and Q4. The team is doing a phenomenal job. Execution is just top rate, and at the end of the day, back to the comments that Bill has made earlier, more and more companies are leaning in and not leaning out because they absolutely have to. And the longer COVID exists - and let's be clear, no one thinks this is going away tomorrow, the more companies have to invest in exactly what ServiceNow is providing. And so again, pipeline looks strong. We feel really good about our Q4 guidance.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question. Your last question is from Zane Chrane of Bernstein Research.\nZane Chrane: Hi, thanks for fitting me in, a little bit of a conceptual question regarding your TAM. I know you've alluded to this in the past, but I get a lot of questions from investors regarding how much is your TAM when you add up the spend on HR versus customer service or IT management, etc.? And it seems like that's maybe not the best way to think about it. Increasingly, it seems like the TAM is a function of how much the employee time - the value of employee time tracking work about work is being wasted in aggregate around the world, compounded with the lost value in sub-optimal business results. When you guys look at that - look at your opportunity in terms of those two variables, assuming that's the correct way to look at it. What do you see as being the size of the opportunity and then which technologies or competitors do you view as being most concerning for as ones you would want to watch on the horizon as a potential threat? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, I mean it's, it's the interesting question. And if you - if you ask 10 different people what the TAM is you will absolutely get 10 different answers. If you look at what Gartner said when we IPO-ed about what the TAM was for ITSM, it was significantly lower than what it is. I think most people would say the TAM is about $165 billion, but that's not including exactly what you talked about right, the real opportunity to automate manual processes throughout every single organization. It's enormous, it's huge. And if we think about that, I think that - I'm not going to quantify it here, but you all can do your math. It's large, and so we absolutely believe that the acceleration of digital transformation is happening today and that we are going to continue to evolve and innovate to ensure that we remain the market leader. And so from a competition perspective, we talk about this often, we're a platform company and a platform company first. And so really with respect to competition, there is no one out there that can do what we do the way we do it, can automate complex workflows across the enterprise, across silos, across departments. The benefit is really that we can provide the end-to-end functionality across IT, employee, customer throughout the organization. We're the only cross-functional platform that can sit on top of any of the systems of record to enable workflows across those systems of records. Right. So as Bill said earlier, no one has to lose for us to continue to grow and drive. And so our differentiation is that we're really the only software company at our size with one platform, one data model, one architecture, and so we're poised to take advantage of that incremental opportunity as it comes. But you're absolutely right, the TAM is getting larger and larger as we really think about how companies really need to automate the back and middle-office for sure.\nZane Chrane: And for what it's worth, I think ServiceNow is the only company that ever estimated a larger TAM than what management claims, so you guys have definitely executed well and congrats on the success. Thank you very much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Zane.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q3 earnings call. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We continue to be ServiceNow strong in support of our employees and communities in these challenging times. We also remain passionately focused on delivering for our customers, partners and shareholders. 2020 has brought unimaginable change to the world. Companies have to operate in new and faster ways, pivoting their business models. Everyone is adapting to new employee and customer expectations. It's all about people. Getting teams to collaborate across the enterprise is now more important than ever. The workplace of the future will be distributed. Managing complex digital workflows will be critical. Enterprises need innovation without disruption. It's clear that speed has become the differentiator. ServiceNow is leading this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make work better for people. And this is what we're seeing. All value chains are being split apart. They are being reformed into modern digital workflows across the enterprise. More than $3 trillion have been invested in digital transformation initiatives. But as IDC research shows us, only 26% of the investments have delivered meaningful ROI. Massive investments is simply not creating massive change. This is fueling the workflow revolution. The missing link is integration. Systems, silos, departments and processes must come together into holistic cross enterprise workflows. The Now Platform unlocks this ROI by offering speed, agility and resilience. Companies need it now. It gives companies the ability to deliver at scale the experiences employees and customers demand. That's the power of the Now Platform, a single architecture and data model that serves the enterprise platform or all other platforms. In other words, it's the platform of digital business. As one CIO said to me, \"My goal with the Now Platform is to enable my colleagues to perform their top 50 tasks in a single environment that provides a consumer like experience.\" The momentum of the workflow revolution is unstoppable. Despite the COVID operating environment, our team delivered outstanding Q3 results. Gina will provide the details. Here are the headlines. We beat expectations across the board. We surpassed 1,000 customers with ACV over $1 million. We landed our largest deal ever with our largest customer, who has now crossed over $40 million in ACV, and we are raising full year guidance today. We're driving sustainable growth well on our way to $10 billion and beyond. I'm incredibly proud of our team. In the most challenging of times, we are focused, disciplined, committed to helping our customers succeed above other priorities. The speed at which we're innovating has never been faster. Our team is leading the future of work. We are releasing new innovations every two weeks with our Safe Workplace Suite, to help our customers safely return their employees back to the workplace. Other new product introductions include hardware asset management, financial services operations, telecom service management, legal service delivery, workplace service delivery and connected operations. I could go on. In addition, our platform innovations are differentiated for the direct-to-consumer industry where subscribers demand flawless customer service. One of the largest streaming services in the world seamlessly upgraded their ServiceNow environment this past weekend with zero downtime. There was no impact to any of their active subscribers. How's that for customer service? Such innovation demonstrates the power of the Now Platform. We were honored in Q3 to be named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise low code application platforms. We believe this is yet another example of the agility of the Now Platform to help customers quickly workflow any challenge. We think our Gartner recognition validates the breadth of our IT solutions, putting ServiceNow in a leader position in the two 2020 Magic Quadrants, IT risk management and IT Vendor risk management tools. And of course, we remain the leader on both completeness of vision and highest and ability to execute for our ITSM core business - amazing. Now let's look at Q3 performance, highlights across our portfolio. Here we go. Our top 20 deals included three or more products. Our core remains ever strong. ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals with customers choosing ITSM Pro in 16 deals. The embedded AI and machine learning capabilities are helping IT organization scale and automate, reduce complexity, cost and risk, while enabling people to work from anywhere. ITOM was included 18 of the top 20 deals. We won deals with Mount Sinai and the federal Defense Information Systems Agency. Our customer workflows continue to be a growth driver, 13 of the top 20 deals included CSM, 8 of those deals were greater than $1 million. Our customer wins in Q3 demonstrate how ServiceNow is becoming the enterprise workflow standard. For example, Q3 was our largest federal quarter ever. We now have nine federal customers over $10 million in ACV. Deals included the US Air Force, US Army and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. And we have new customer wins with agencies, such as the US Senate and Federal Claims Court. In our largest deal ever, the Department of Veteran Affairs is modernizing its enterprise service management and IT capabilities. They are using the Now Platform to have real-time visibility into the health, availability and costs of their critical business services. This will deliver significant benefits to our heroic veterans. With ITSM Pro, VA will automate its manual workflows with AI and machine learning capabilities to free up employees to better serve veterans. As the US Air Force has publicly described, they are deploying the Now Platform as part of their digital Air Force of the future vision. We are helping them deliver Genius Bar like self-help services to the women and men serving our country around the globe. In addition to federal, state governments also are leveraging the Now Platform. Tennessee's Department of Human Services expanded its relationship with ServiceNow. They're using CSM to reopen state offices for public services while keeping health and safety a priority. They quickly adopted our latest Now Platform, Paris release, utilizing the new feature that enables the public to self schedule appointments and digitally check-in when arriving for appointments. The State of Alaska's Governor issued a directive to protect workers and ensure that the state can continue operating in a pandemic environment. Their existing systems, manual processes and dispersed population created numerous issues to work effectively. The HR department is transitioning to a centralized operating model, and ServiceNow will solve their manual onboarding issues and enable employee workflows to be digitally transformed. Outside of federal and state, and customers across industries, the Now Platform is the standard for driving enterprise digital transformation. 2020 has bought significant changes to Dell's work-from-home model. Our HR product will support this new way of working by providing enterprise onboarding and transitions, and the Now Platform is helping Dell in its mission to provide the best customer experience in the markets they serve. Leading managed services provider, TPX, became the first customer of our new telecom industry specific product. ServiceNow is going to run TPX's customer portal, enabling onboarding, project management, customer servicing and IT support. A major Indian financial institution chose ServiceNow to give them complete visibility to better control enterprise risks, replacing legacy solutions that were stitched together. This is another example of the movement we are seeing in the industry to replace legacy solutions and consolidate on the Now Platform, huge savings. In Q3, we continued to see strong momentum with our Safe Workplace Suite of apps. This quarter we added two new apps into the state Workplace Suite, employee travel safety and health and safety testing. Our Safe Workplace apps demonstrate our ability to innovate quickly and deliver their time to value in weeks, not months and years. We've seen nearly 800 downloads of our Safe Workplace apps. Customers include Standard & Poor's Raymond James and Rutgers University. At Rutgers, our Safe Workplace apps are being used for health screening, contact tracing and room reservations, to ensure a safe environment for all students and faculty. Here is my favorite customer win. I'm a huge basket ball fan, as many of you know, my grandfather Bobby McDermott was a Hall of Famer. So I couldn't be more proud of how ServiceNow helped pro basketball have a successful restart season. The NBA and WNBA were able to implement ServiceNow's employee workflows in under a week to manage the complex manual processes associated with restarting. ServiceNow helped league facilitate screening for more than 2,600 lead staff, vendors and guests who entered the NBA and WNBA bubble in Florida and successfully processed more than 13,000 essential documents. Using ServiceNow technology, the league demonstrated that a safe, careful return to professional sports was possible with the right tools and protocols in place. We are very proud to become the official workflow partner of the NBA and WNBA, and we look forward to helping the league continue to drive digital transformation to deliver great employee, player and fan experiences. As we drive great customer wins, our partner ecosystem is growing even stronger. We are grateful for the investments our partners are making to grow their ServiceNow businesses and to serve our customers. We recently announced a go-to-market partnership between IBM and ServiceNow. This new business opportunity combines ServiceNow ITSM and ITOM capabilities with IBM's Watson AIOps to help customers automate IT at scale, reducing cost and risk. Last week, we announced an expanded partnership with Accenture. The new Accenture ServiceNow Business Group will accelerate digital transformation programs for customers in telecom, government, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and life sciences. In summary, Q3 was another great outperformed quarter. ServiceNow is accelerating. We are confident in our ability to succeed in this environment. We are bullish on our long-term outlook and our path to $10 billion and beyond. Our leadership has expanded our reach and opportunities with marquee partnerships such as the NBA and WNBA, IBM and Accenture. There are many more. Our brand is resonating. We are becoming an essential C-suite strategic partner. Our ecosystem is growing fast. Our go-to-market capabilities are stronger than ever. Our product innovation is second to none. We are deeply committed to attracting, retaining and developing the best talent in this industry. We are a big tent company dedicated to diversity, inclusion and belonging. Diversity makes us stronger, making ServiceNow the destination company where the best talent belongs and thrives. And this is what's going to make us unstoppable. Our new Board member and new Chief Global Talent Officer were announced today, and it demonstrates the caliber of people we are attracting. I could not be more thrilled to have Larry Jackson joining our board and Gaby Toledano joining our leadership team. Both are exceptional leaders. Larry is leading a music industry revolution for Apple Music. His experience using technology to create innovative market leading consumer experiences will be invaluable as we drive innovative employee and customer experiences to the global marketplace. Likewise, Gaby brings deep-tech industry and talent leadership experience building world-class organizations at scale for some of the best-known companies in the world. We were humbled to recently be recognized as the company with the best leadership team in an anonymous survey of more than 10,000 employees across the industry. Gaby is a great addition who will only make us stronger. In so many ways, we are just getting started. This year's unprecedented headwinds have only strengthened our digital transformation tailwinds. We have the platform businesses need, the workflow standard for enterprise transformation, the missing link for integration of existing technology investments and the creation of modern enterprise workflows. Remember, behind every great experience is a great workflow. Whatever challenge a business is facing, we workflow it, we will make workflow a verb. ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We will not slow down in pursuit of this goal. We couldn't be more fired up to finish this year very strong. And now I will turn the call over to our outstanding CFO, and my friend, Gina. Thank you very much, I appreciate it, Raimo. First of all, we're learning that digital transformation is actually accelerating in the COVID environment. It is however a platform game. So you need to have the platform that can truly make the difference. And we see workflow as the new productivity unlock. When you look at IDC, talking about where it's thoroughly invested and system of record kind of change. You see system of action taking on a whole new meaning now in the information technology industry, which puts us in a very nice position in any environment. So I think what happens here is COVID accelerated digital transformation. Now that people are into it, they've got to keep going as fast as they possibly can. Our direct sales force is every bit as relevant as ever before, and we are continuing to make sure the coverage model expands geographically by industry and also persona. You can also complement this very nicely with an inside selling motion to both support existing accounts and pursue net new logos. You're going to be in an environment where you can do events. These events do not have to be done in big stadiums with thousands of people. You can do them digitally and have techniques where you bring live experiences into the event. That also gives a growth company like ServiceNow the ability to take some of that T&E and put it into revenue strategies for future growth. So we're super excited super, super confident about our ability to execute in this environment, because as you know, Raimo, the future of work is now totally different than it was eight months ago. And thank goodness we leaned into that when we did in March and started a revolution. Yes, I believe, you know, as I said, what happened with digital transformation might have been accelerated by COVID. But the fact is, I think it brought everything to light. When people had to work in a distributed way, work from home, all of the technology needs that they have, the communications needs that they have, the self-service needs that they have, all of these things became extremely clear in a COVID environment. And now that that environment is clear, if you read the research, clearly we're never going to go back to the way things were even after the pandemic is resolved. So the future of work is changing. The millennial generation is changing. The way people work will change. And as it relates to the federal government, it's a big opportunity because the information that's required to get across the country to citizens is very slow. So the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing digital services. So these workflow services are going to be here for a long time because there's a lot of things to fix. So we are in a - in an environment now where I think the genie is out of the bottle. It's never going back in, and digital transformation is going to continue to accelerate. And yes, we do have return to work, but that hasn't been the major source of the revenue drive in federal, state and local, it's really been more automating and rethinking work processes and automating everything in a much more human-friendly way. It's my pleasure. So the bottom line, Kirk, if you think about it, the future of work in terms of the employee experience. It's clear now that one portal that can provide all the services that employees need, from on-boarding on an employee to self-serving all of their cases to training them and creating a segment of one learning journey for them, to managing issues that might resolve - that might come up and need to be resolved across multiple functions. All of these things are workflow related. So I think the future of work has truly accelerated the consumer strength of our application because it's so easy to use. It's so beautiful to use, people love it. And we hide all the complexity of what's been created over the last half-century. In terms of the customer experience, the customers today, especially in the digital world, expect companies to give them great service. And the kind of the SFA of the past, how do I upsell and cross sell you, they're not in a good mood for that. What they really want is they want you to give them a great service in terms of whatever they signed up for and then make all the self-help tools available to them and use AI to automate the experience. And then if you do need human intervention, the workflow process itself should initiate a call order to a bot or to a human to resolve something so that the customer gets what they want, and they get a digitally. And you know Netflix taught us this. Disney+ taught us this. This is the new way that customers want to work, and they're not in a mood for an up-sell or a cross-sell when they're calling it to have a problem resolved or they are trying to get a service initiated. And similarly, big companies have a direct-to-consumer headset, right now. It's kind of like, hey, the middle people I used to work through, wholesalers, retailers, etc. aren't open. So I've got to go direct to my consumer with my brand and my product and create a great experience. All of this is workflow. So the changes in the future work are going to be there. But then you could take a large bank. I had a CIO extraordinaire in with our Board, and she talked about retiring 283 legacy applications and converging them all on the Now Platform. And there's a list of another 100, and she basically told a great story about literally thousands of people working from everywhere and getting them all their tools and procedures and allowing them to navigate in this world on their own in a way that's highly pleasing to them because they want to drive productivity with their workforce. They also want to mitigate risk and have controls in place, so the place is run well. And everything now is just running so much better. They took out all these 283 systems, and they delivered like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars by application that they retired. And when you add it all up, it's in the triple-digit millions. So they are saving huge money. Well, Karl, thank you very much. You know it's been a year. It's been amazing. I love it here, and the workforce, the partners, the customers, the satisfaction, the loyalty, the excitement on Net Promoter Score, everything is just so positive. And the culture here is so committed, and I think that has really jelled very well with my DNA. So I'm just honored to be here and having the time of my life. As it relates to M&A, we have a situation here where the core business - and the core business has so much potential in and of itself, and the platform has so much potential in and of itself. And when you extend that to the employee experience and some of the items I mentioned today and then you also think about the workforce and the workforce of the future and all the experience layers that go along with that and what ServiceNow will do for people and we're going to make people and their lives so much better in the enterprise. Then you think about customer service management and the enormous success we're having with customer service management and the huge TAM of customer service management. We just have so much opportunity organically that you have to think about geographies. You have to think about industries. You have to think about the personas we're going to serve. And when you put it all together, I mean, depending on what research you look at - Morgan Stanley when I first came in here had just taking paper-based processes and enterprises and automating them into workflows was $228 billion in the US. So if you extrapolate that to the world, you could easily get to $400 billion just in that. If you think about the employee experience, the CSM, the core business, now with ML and AI and all the operational efficiencies, so much organically. So I think the tuck-in strategy has worked well for us because we've been able to re-platform all of that code to the Now Platform. We have no tech debt. Many companies who have expanded through acquisition now have a mess on their hands that they're spending engineering time reintegrating them all the time, instead of building that amortization. So we're very thoughtful about what we're doing here and why we're doing it in service to the customers. So long and short of it is, it's an organic growth story. There's plenty of room to grow. The TAM is big, and if we did something on a more sizable scale, we would have very clear guard rails on doing that for the customer's interests and the large expansion opportunity. But we would never take away the experience benefits they're getting from the Now Platform. Keith, that's the amazing thing, you know, we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So if you think about the large system of record providers out there, we have no quarrel with them. Most of the CEOs and technology leaders out there have invested heavily in those platforms. And the last thing they're interested in doing right now is switching out those platforms, especially in a COVID environment where speed, acceleration resiliency and serving customer and employees at the top of their to-do list. So that's not a problem for us. And then if you think about the point solution providers, of course there's always going to be point solution providers running around, but we became the platform standard for workflow automation. And now we've extended the perimeter into the employee and the customer service management areas, which are huge TAMs. Also as Gartner indicated, we're really gaining tremendous traction on the platform itself, where people are building innovation onto the platform. So what I see happening is large companies in the Fortune 2000 are basically taking legacy, and they're putting it on to Now. They're basically saying how can retire my legacy because I can go to ServiceNow, get a consumer grade experience, and I can automate my workflows across domains, systems, silos and give my employees and the customers a great experience. And that's so important to them, they don't even ask about price as much as they ask about how quickly can you get it done. And then when we tell them how quickly we can get it done, they are literally in awe because we're talking weeks. We don't talk in years, and that's a very different language from most large-scale companies. So I would really tell you there is no competitor that we go into these large deals worried about. We're just focused on the customer, getting their business to run and do it well. And then obviously we have all the tools, processes and people in place to show them the value. And we not only show them what's possible, but we manage the value through the life cycle of the relationship at an art form level. And these are plays that have been put into the ServiceNow playbook in the last year that are scaling very, very nicely and the customer can see what they're getting out of the platform, and they like it. Yes, Keith, and one of the things to build on what Gina's saying, we pretty much have so many people trying to work with ServiceNow, and we're very honored by that. But you got to really thread the needle to get in here. So what we're putting into the company is sustainable, and we'd rather have a job open for an extended period of time rather than settle on talent. So we're going to build a great, great company here. The other thing I want to mention to you is the margin profile is also substantiated by revenue per employee. And if you look at our revenue per employee and how it's climbed and how it's climbed against any comparison you can come up with in the enterprise, it's pretty impressive. And Gina and I study that very carefully, and we want to make sure that our shareholders have total visibility into all the things that we're doing. And we also run the whole company on the Now Platform. So we are getting tremendous efficiencies out of that, that are being reinvested into people. And I think that's a big thing, and we're really focused on the engineering pride of the company. We make great, great products, and we provide great service with those products, and the brand obviously is resonating. But in addition to that, where we put the money is on things that will return for the shareholders, so in the form of revenue and sustained revenue, in addition to the margin. So we're really, really focused on the whole P&L right now. Yes, so Phil, I'm really excited to have crossed the year here. We crossed that threshold which is great. In terms of building the go-to-market machine here. It's an outstanding business because the business was built on Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. And when you have a baseline of very, very happy customers that love the product and are having a great experience, it's a lot easier to scale an organization. So I start with that, in total respect of the great engineering and outstanding go-to-market folks that we have in the company that deeply care about customer satisfaction and loyalty, and that baseline has enabled us to focus. I'd say we're focusing very carefully, Phil, on the Global 2000. We are now geographically expanding in Asia. We also have several places within EMEA that we can expand, and we're on top of that. And we're also segmenting things much more by industry now because as you know, when you have an industry solution it's easily replicated in other parts of the world in and other accounts. So we're very good with large customers getting success and then fast replication of that success. And the value that that delivers is something that's still a tailwind, and there's plenty of room to grow. Furthermore, I do agree that that works especially well in a COVID environment on a same account revenue growth basis. And then there is a whole new motion that we have for the net new logo expansion of the company, and that will nicely complement the direct sales force. So there are several indirect techniques that we're putting into place. And just to let all shareholders know that we're thinking about this stuff in our sleep too, we want to make sure that things that we used to do that, perhaps because of COVID or we came up with a better idea even after COVID, is going to be invested in things that give us growth and do so with high efficiency. So we're covering the board geographically, by industry, by persona. It's a direct game. The focus is on the 2000. But we can also go down market with a lot of self-service techniques and insider techniques that we've yet to fully form, and they are now in place, and we think they'll hit the ground running in '21, Phil. And Derek, one thing to build Gina's commentary on the pipeline. If you look at our pipeline in a snapshot. This time last year our pipeline is up this year versus last year, and even when - if you want to play what-if game, the distressed industry has got harder hit, do you have enough coverage on the conversion side? We have more than enough. So we've already gone through all that, and the retention has been outstanding, including in the distressed industries, and the pipeline overall is substantially strong, and the loyalty actually went up this quarter versus last. So the business is a really good shape. Yes, this is such a good question. If you think about a partner like EY as an example, if you talk to Carmine - ServiceNow - I met him in Santa Clara year ago on the ServiceNow platform, bringing his whole team. And we were one of the partners. We were one of the companies, and now it's us and Microsoft as his two most strategic global partners. If you think about Accenture, I talked about Julie at Accenture today. Accenture's now opened up a global practice dedicated with complete passion and investment. If you look at IBM, IBM had a very large on-premise, their version of ITSM on-premise legacy. And they've entered into a big partnership with us to actually move that to the ServiceNow cloud. We team up with them on their Watson AIOps, everybody wins. But best of all, now IBM has committed to a large scale ServiceNow practice. And this is also true with all the other signature partners that you're well aware of. So what happened, what has changed? There isn't a single partner out there that doesn't have at least a $1 billion, if not many more billion vision for what they will do with ServiceNow in the very near future. They are all increasing their investment. They're all looking at ServiceNow as a standard for digital transformation, and they all see either ServiceNow as the cross platform integration engine to straighten out the way companies run and also complement their other practices. Or they're looking at it as a pure net new workflow revolution practice on some of the dimensions that Gina and I discussed today. In all cases, it is really getting tremendous tailwind, and it's one of the network effects that I think is coming from building great products, having tremendous engineering pride, and also lining up a company only with customer satisfaction. I mean, that's really what we care about. And the partners have really resonated with that because when you work with ServiceNow, you don't have situations where you're cleaning up product messes, you have situations where ServiceNow complements their practice. It works, everybody is happy with it. How do we scale? That's the conversation. Thank you very much, Zane."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a fantastic quarter for ServiceNow as the team continued to execute very well despite the challenges created by COVID-19. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, and that top line beat carried through to a robust operating margin and strong free cash flow generation. Q3 subscription revenues were $1.091 billion, representing 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. Q3 subscription billings were $1.081 billion, representing 24% year-over-year adjusted growth, driven by the great execution from our sales team. Remaining performance obligations or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $7.3 billion, representing 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, and current RPO was approximately $3.8 billion, representing 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. Our top-line strength demonstrates the power of our product portfolio and our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. The Now Platform is uniquely positioned to deliver exceptional time to value and provide workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees, and partners. We are solving customer's challenges and playing a key role in accelerating their digital transformation. The Now Platform enables the missing integrations that links together system, silos, departments, and processes into unified workflows. Our best-in-class renewal rate improved quarter-over-quarter to 98%, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers operations. As Bill highlighted, our sales teams continue to win bigger deals in Q3, including our largest ever $13 million ACV deal. We closed 41 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter. And what's more, nine of those are with net new customers. Our ability to land new logos despite the macro uncertainty that COVID has introduced is a testament to our amazing products and our brand that continues to resonate with the C-suite. We now have over 1,000 customers paying us more than $1 million of ACV. Turning to profitability, Q3 operating margin was 26%, a 400 basis point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance, lower T&E expenses as a result of COVID and about 150 basis points of marketing spend that shifted from Q3 into Q4. Year-over-year, our Q3 operating margin was consistent with last year as lower T&E expenses were offset by planned incremental investments in R&D and marketing spend of pipeline generation. Our free cash flow margin was 19%, up 500 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower T&E spend and CapEx in the quarter as well as strong collections. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing in our business. Overall, we see strong momentum heading into the last quarter of the year. The highly affected industries we outlined earlier in the year, which represented about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality, retail and energy, continue to see macro headwinds, but remain steady customers of ServiceNow. We closed six new deals over $1 million in these affected industries. And while we do expect some headwinds in severely impacted industries like airlines, renewals of existing customers have remained very strong. Furthermore, we've also seen very healthy payment terms and DSOs. Collections have been strong, helping drive free cash flow upside in Q3, and we expect that trend to continue into Q4. Enterprises are realizing that they need to quickly adapt to the workplace of the future, and ServiceNow is providing a smarter and faster way to workflow. Our pipeline generation has remained robust, and our pipeline coverage ratio for the remainder of the year gives us confidence in our ability to deliver a strong finish to 2020. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We are raising our subscription revenues range to between $4.257 billion and $4.262 billion, representing 31% year-over-year constant currency growth. We are raising our subscription billings range to between $4.78 billion and $4.8 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year adjusted growth. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, and we are raising our full-year 2020 operating margin from 24% to 24.5%. This reflects additional savings from lower T&E expenses related to COVID. Let me note that while we expect many of these expenses to return at some point in the future, we're taking our learnings from the current environment and leaning into the future of work. These learnings will have lasting effects on our overall efficiency, giving us the ability to redeploy savings elsewhere. We plan to take advantage of the incremental leverage and make disciplined investments for growth. We're reinvesting in R&D and quota bearing resources to drive innovation and pipelines that fuel our tremendous organic growth engine, ensuring that we maintain our market leadership and are well positioned to take advantage of the digital acceleration heading into 2021 and beyond. Turning to free cash. We are raising our full-year 2020 free cash flow margin 200 basis points from 29.5% to 31.5%, reflecting the increase in our operating margin and our expectations for better than originally forecasted collections for the year. Turning to Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.155 billion and $1.160 billion, representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $1.625 billion and $1.645 billion, representing 24% to 26% year-over-year adjusted growth Moving on to profitability. For Q4, we expect a 21% operating margin, which includes about 150 basis points of marketing spend that shifted from Q3 into Q4 and some incremental investment into pipeline generating activities to set us up for a strong and successful 2021. Finally, we expect fourth quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 201 million and 199 million respectively. In summary, ServiceNow is the strategic workflow authority. As enterprises are adapting to the workplace of the future, CXO's are using the Now Platform to create new workflows for new value chains, transforming experiences across siloed systems and functions across the enterprise. The Now Platform is the missing integration layer that multiplies the power of enterprises existing technology investments and delivers exceptional time to value. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance as we focus on addressing these needs for our customers. Our ecosystem partners are efficiently expanding our capabilities and our reach, and more and more enterprises are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. We are the platform company for digital business. I'm very excited about the traction we are seeing in our journey towards becoming a $10 billion revenue company and the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for your dedication during these trying times. We know everyone has a lot going on in their lives, juggling work and caring for your families at home, and we just want to express how appreciative we are of your contributions. ServiceNow wouldn't be in the position of strength it is without each and every one of you. You make us ServiceNow. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions. Yes. So thanks for the question Carl. It's a great question, and I was trying to give some - I was trying to elaborate here, right, so the 300 basis point of margin improvement that you're seeing this year as you said it is not sustainable, right. Some of these costs will return and what we wanted to say is that not all of them will at the same level. Right. And so we absolutely will be leaning into the future of work and what that means from a cost perspective, but we don't plan to just rest on our laurels. And as Bill talked about the acceleration of digital transformation really being at the forefront and really making sure that we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth and really remain market leader, we will absolutely continue to invest to ensure that we are well positioned in the view of that exploration happening. And so more will come on the absolute margin guide. But I wanted to make clear that the 300 basis points is not sustainable, and that certainly some of the learnings and efficiencies that we'll see in a post pandemic world will be redeployed in areas such as R&D and in quota bearing resources to really kick start growth. Great question, Keith. So I appreciate it. So, yes, you're right in your numbers. Head count is up significantly. We made the pledge that we were not going to lay off this year in the COVID-environment, and not only that, but we were actually going to continue to grow our headcount pretty aggressively year-over-year, especially in R&D and in sales. And so we have done just that, and we will continue to do that. With respect to trends, we are really focused on hiring 9s and 10s in this organization. And the announcements that we've made on new leadership has been fantastic. And we're really getting high-quality high-caliber talent. People want to come work for ServiceNow, and we are just so thrilled about that. And so, yes, I absolutely believe that this trend will continue that we will grow headcount. From a margin perspective, I said earlier, it's a bit too early to comment on '21. Certainly the 300 basis points that we're seeing this year is not sustainable, and we absolutely will be very focused and disciplined in all our investments, including headcount, to ensure that we're driving the right level of ROI, but at the same time really investing behind growth and innovation. Thank you, Keith. And then on your second question with respect to sales efficiency and ramp reps, I've been extremely impressed, Phil, with the sales team's ability to close large deals on the move. As we mentioned, we closed 41 deals greater than $1 million in ACVs this quarter. On a sequential basis, we actually saw an improvement in sales productivity, with the most notable uptick coming from North America. Attrition rates remain low, almost at the lowest rates we've seen in quite a long time. And so we're entering into '21 with ramps reps that are significantly higher than at this time last year. So we feel really good about sales productivity, about the ramp reps. And of course ramping new employees in a virtual environment we use the Now Platform. And so our on-boarding platform and product has just been phenomenal, and so the 27% growth that you've seen this year in total heads, we've been onboarding the bulk of those folks remotely in a COVID environment. And it's been flawless. I've actually had a couple hires that were so impressed with how easy it was to onboard. And so really, really proud of the entire team. Thanks. Yes. Great, I'll take that. Listen, I think that our expansion rates have been really holding up well, similar to what we've seen pre-COVID, so really strong, happy with what we're seeing, even with respect to the distressed verticals. I talked about those deals greater than $1 million in the year - I'm sorry, in the quarter, holding up really strong. And so we feel really good about expansion rate. We feel really good about even our significance in these distressed verticals, right. We are seeing more upsells than down-sells. And so again, feel really good about that. If you talk about the demand for ITSM Pro, well, it continues to be going well and really strong - we continue to have a strong quarter. In Q3, we had great strength. We saw increases in automation and operational resiliency within the product. As we've talked about before, there's a 25% price uplift from ITSM Pro, and 15% of our customers are using it today. So there's significant runway still ahead of us with respect to the Pro SKU. And so, again in summary, really doing well. Customers are resonating as the AI and ML capabilities that are incremental in the Pro SKU are really resonating right now more than ever as you think about the future of work in this COVID environment. And so still early innings with a lot of runway to go. Yes, it's a great question. As you know, right, so that the uptick in cases and France closing down is certainly a key - key on all of our minds, right, not just from a business perspective. But what I will say is that as you saw the guide, we're actually raising our guide for Q4. And so we definitely took a cautious approach in our - all of our assumptions back at the end of March, and we continue to refine them as we go. What gives me confidence right now in our current Q4 guide is our pipeline stats, right. The coverage is better than last year. Our close rates are strong. And so we continue to be able to evolve and close deals in this remote environment. And so if you think about where we were back in March, April, May, the whole world basically locked down. We feel confident that we'll be able to really continue to hit our numbers and have a strong close to 2020 and Q4. The team is doing a phenomenal job. Execution is just top rate, and at the end of the day, back to the comments that Bill has made earlier, more and more companies are leaning in and not leaning out because they absolutely have to. And the longer COVID exists - and let's be clear, no one thinks this is going away tomorrow, the more companies have to invest in exactly what ServiceNow is providing. And so again, pipeline looks strong. We feel really good about our Q4 guidance. Yes, I mean it's, it's the interesting question. And if you - if you ask 10 different people what the TAM is you will absolutely get 10 different answers. If you look at what Gartner said when we IPO-ed about what the TAM was for ITSM, it was significantly lower than what it is. I think most people would say the TAM is about $165 billion, but that's not including exactly what you talked about right, the real opportunity to automate manual processes throughout every single organization. It's enormous, it's huge. And if we think about that, I think that - I'm not going to quantify it here, but you all can do your math. It's large, and so we absolutely believe that the acceleration of digital transformation is happening today and that we are going to continue to evolve and innovate to ensure that we remain the market leader. And so from a competition perspective, we talk about this often, we're a platform company and a platform company first. And so really with respect to competition, there is no one out there that can do what we do the way we do it, can automate complex workflows across the enterprise, across silos, across departments. The benefit is really that we can provide the end-to-end functionality across IT, employee, customer throughout the organization. We're the only cross-functional platform that can sit on top of any of the systems of record to enable workflows across those systems of records. Right. So as Bill said earlier, no one has to lose for us to continue to grow and drive. And so our differentiation is that we're really the only software company at our size with one platform, one data model, one architecture, and so we're poised to take advantage of that incremental opportunity as it comes. But you're absolutely right, the TAM is getting larger and larger as we really think about how companies really need to automate the back and middle-office for sure."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Lisa Banks, Vice President of Finance. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nLisa Banks: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2020 and full year of 2020. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this conference call, particularly our guidance, is based on information as of July 29, 2020, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impacts of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The forward-looking guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts as we know them today. Many of these assumptions relate to the matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, and the length of our sales cycles, particularly for customers in certain industries. Significant changes in the future could cause us to modify our guidance higher or lower. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and MD&A in our SEC filings, including our 2019 10-K and our 10-Q that will be filed for Q2 2020, for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation, and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2020 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. This COVID environment continues to create challenges for many, and we continue to support our stakeholders, our employees and customers in every way possible. Before getting into our strong results, here are a few trends shaping the overarching environment for ServiceNow. This unprecedented environment is breaking physical supply chains. It is exposing the weak links in the old value chains, illuminating how companies struggle cross-functionally to deliver the workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees and partners. The world is experiencing a seismic shift from the obsolete business process evolution to the new workflow revolution. CXOs are using the Now Platform to create new workflows or new value chains, transforming experiences across siloed systems and functions across the entire enterprise. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for workflow. We are trusted sea suite innovator. We multiply the value of existing technology investments. We deliver exceptional time to value, and our customers understand the business continuity and resilience that the Now Platform enables. Driven by these factors and many others, we couldn't be prouder of our very strong Q2 performance. We beat expectations, beating consensus and guidance and became a $4 billion run rate cloud company. We're raising our topline and operating -- and free cash margin guidance for the full year for 2020, which Gina will provide more detail on shortly. We are delivering safe workplace product innovation in two-week cycles, helping our customers succeed and keeping their employees healthy and safe in these unprecedented times. ServiceNow is a growth company. We are becoming even stronger on our journey to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. We remain totally focused on our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Let me share some additional perspective on how we are supporting customers. CEOs and management teams are focused on protecting revenue, improving productivity and ensuring business resiliency. This has turned digital transformation into a business imperative across all industries. ServiceNow is on the front lines of getting companies reopened. We are helping employees get back to the workplace safely. In May, we launched our safe workplace application suite and dashboard. Our engineering teams continue to deliver product innovations every two weeks. These are real products with an architecture that makes it easy to connect employee health data to their employee badges to ensure safety and security in the workplace. More than 550 organizations worldwide have downloaded our safe workplace suite, companies such as Uber, Coca-Cola European Partners and Bank United are using the apps and dashboard to return to the workplace safely. This is the power of the Now Platform, the ability to move fast, be agile, solve problems quickly with low-code, no-code app development, create new workflows that deliver great experiences. We're helping our customers solve for once in-a-generation challenges, even as they capitalize on the opportunities of digital transformation because we offer one platform, one data model and one architecture. Customers see the Now Platform as a smarter way to workflow. Gina will share our full financial results with you, but here are some highlights from another quarter in which ServiceNow outperformed. Despite the COVID headwinds, we closed 40 deals greater than $1 million in ACV this quarter. We now have 964 customers paying us more than 1 million ACV annually. Our linearity was strong. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 97%, demonstrating ServiceNow resilience. Q2 deals underscore the strength of our product portfolio. 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. Customer examples include Equifax, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the State of California. Our core business remains ever strong, with continued momentum in ITSM Pro and growth in risk and security, especially as enterprises focus on business continuity. ITSM Pro led eight of the 10 ITSM deals, delivering customers increased automation and operational resiliency. ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals, 15 of the top 20 deals also included security. We did our largest ever risk deal with Providence Health & Services, which has 51 hospitals, 121,000 employees and 800 non-acute facilities. As a heavily regulated business, Providence is partnering with ServiceNow to manage risk, and improve productivity across their business. Employee experience is more relevant than ever. Our HR business now continues to be strong with over 750 customers, in Q2, we had eight deals that were greater than $1 million. For example, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is using ServiceNow to improve efficiency of their HR shared services and to increase employee engagement. They are enhancing employee communications to support their telework initiative. Goldman Sachs, a long time ServiceNow ITSM customer became new HR customer in Q2. They are using our HR products to provide a more consistent employee experience and to drive cost savings. Creating the best experiences and rapidly scaling digital services matter now more than ever. This is driving momentum in our customer service management business. We have more than 50 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV annually. We are delivering great consumer-grade customer experiences powered by industry-specific workflows. Our Zoom partnership is a great customer example. Zoom's usage rocketed 30 times in 4four months. 30x increase. They're now up to 300 million daily meeting participants. ServiceNow CSM solution is enabling Zoom to scale its customer service operations, providing critical communication capabilities for its rapidly expanding global community. CSM also provides proactive case management and personalized self-service options to help Zoom manage the influx of customer requests. We're proud that Zoom chose CSM and the Now Platform to help manage its exponential growth. Zoom also is using our AIOps capabilities to enable its new hardware as a service business model. Thank you, Zoom. Underlying every one of our products is the Now Platform, the platform of platforms. Let me share some examples of how the Now Platform and products translated into strategic customer wins this quarter. A great example is the U.S. State Department. They use the Now Platform to create a dozen apps in just three weeks, tracking COVID requirements for every country on the planet to keep employees traveling safely. With JPMorgan, we closed our largest IT business management and our largest DevOps deal ever. As they consolidate their ITSM, they are improving their employee experiences, leveraging advanced workflows and Intelligent Automation. We're honored that JPMorgan Chase, selected the Now Platform to drive their digital transformation creating great employee experiences and increasing productivity. Fiserv, a global fintech leader, recently completed a merger and need to consolidate systems and processes to gain greater visibility of their assets. Using the Now Platform, they can now gain visibility and insight into the newly combined infrastructure and their emerging dependencies. This reduces time to resolution, improves customer experiences and reduces OpEx, all while proactively providing better services to their customers. We're also now working with the State of Montana to automate their citizen workflows. With COVID, they needed to evolve face-to-face citizen interactions to remote services. They also wanted to reduce the cost and complexity of asset management across multiple agencies, while maintaining data privacy between all of them. It was our ability to provide a single enterprise platform to service all of Montana's agencies that earned us their trust and their business. ServiceNow is partnering with the world's largest brands. Disney is another example of how the Now Platform driving business model innovation. Ann Schmittm VP and CIO of Disney Streaming Services joined me as part of my keynote during our Knowledge 20 experience with the support of ServiceNow CSM workflows, Disney Plus quickly grew to more than 55 million subscribers in just a few months after launch. During the Knowledge keynote, then share has ServiceNow provided Disney. And I quote, 'an extremely flexible and extensible platform that allowed them to develop a best-in-breed customer health center and best-in-breed tooling for their agents to support their customers around the world.' These customer stories and so many others, are why the industry now understands the magic of a Now Platform and the strength of our core business. Top IT analysts firms that named as a leader in three new markets to ServiceNow, CSM, DevOps and Software Asset Management. We also are honored to be named the overall digital innovation award winner by Ventana Research. Every company has had to pivot in this new environment to continue to engage customers in meaningful ways. I am incredibly proud of how our team quickly pivoted knowledge from a four-day physical event that was scheduled to be held in Orlando, to a six-week digital experience that brought ServiceNow community together worldwide. And listen to this. We reached almost twice as many people globally this year when we did at Knowledge 2019. We also delivered more than 820 hours of content, including 1,100 customer-led sessions and breakouts, building a strong pipeline. As our traction continues to grow, our ecosystem continues to strengthen, our partners play a critical role in accelerating customer digital transformation. For example, we recently announced an expanded alliance with Deloitte, to help customers accelerate their HR service delivery efforts, and to provide employees with exceptional digital experiences anywhere. With customer loyalty and our growing ecosystem, we are increasingly part of digital transformation conversations that give us absolute confidence in our business model and our strategic relevance with customers. Our innovation is inspired by solving the needs of customers across geography, industry and persona, as we shape the workflow revolution; our best ideas are ahead of us. Our overarching focus is clear: innovating for customers as we scale ServiceNow to $10 billion and beyond. Our strong management team and our 12,000 employees will enable us to achieve our bold ambitions. To continue driving our growth today, we are announcing the next evolution of our already outstanding go-to-market organization. We are leveraging our tried, true and proven executive talent to continue our strong momentum. Effective immediately, Kevin Haverty is named Chief Revenue Officer, as he continues leading our global sales organization. Kevin has been with the company for nine years and has been leading our sales organization for the last six years. He's owned the number the whole time. Lara Caimi is named to the new role of Chief Customer and Partner Officer, leading all customer success programs and the development of strategic partner activities. She joined ServiceNow in 2017 as Chief Strategy Officer and has led nine acquisitions. They will both report directly to me. I'm really excited. We also recently welcomed Paul Smith, as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our EMEA business, which, by the way, just reached a $1 billion revenue run rate. Joining us from Salesforce, he has a track record for triple-digit growth. Paul is a great example of how ServiceNow is attracting premier talent worldwide. We are fast becoming the employer of choice for our industry's best talent. Before closing, I want to take a moment to honor David Schneider. David has decided to retire at the end of 2020, after a stellar nine years at ServiceNow and more than 35 years in the industry. David Truly has earned the right to step away and began a new personal chapter in his life. David epitomizes our purpose and values. It has been a tremendous honor to work so closely with such a beloved leader. He is ServiceNow family. He always will be, and I wish him the very best in his retirement. David will remain President Emeritus and an adviser to me until the end of the year. In summary, we are ServiceNow strong. In extraordinary times are born extraordinary opportunities. In this once in a lifetime moment, we are at the top of our game. Our people are rising up to seize the opportunities before us. I\u2019m incredibly proud or our culture, our focus, discipline and execution. ServiceNow people have never been more engaged, more focused on serving the enormous names of our customers. Our partners are with us. The ServiceNow ecosystem is truly thriving. Our brand continues to resonate, and we are creating greater awareness and relevance with the C-suite. I constantly hear how people deeply connect to our brand and the humanity of our purpose. Ladies and gentlemen, ServiceNow is special. We're leading the workflow revolution, which leads the future of our business. Now workflows on the Now Platform. The opportunity has never been greater. We will fulfill our purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. We\u2019re hungry, we're humble and we're taking nothing for granted. We\u2019re on the move to our destiny to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Thank you very much for your time and attention today. I look forward to your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Gina. Gina?\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter for ServiceNow despite the macroeconomic headwinds created by COVID-19. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, while continuing to drive margin expansion and very healthy free cash flow. Q2 subscription revenues were $1.016 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth, making ServiceNow a $4 billion revenue run rate company, a milestone on our way towards $10 billion. Q2 subscription billings were $1.018 billion, representing 26% year-over-year adjusted growth, driven by solid execution from our sales team. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $7 billion, representing 31% year-over-year constant currency growth. And current RPO was approximately $3.5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. Top line strength in the quarter was driven by continued expansion of our existing customers. Our best-in-class renewal rate remained at 97%, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customer\u2019s operations. Our sales teams continue to win large deals in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we closed 40 deals greater than $1 million in ACV, an increase from Q1. What's more, the average size of those deals was bigger than any quarter over the past year, and Q2 was our first quarter in which we closed two deals over $10 million, all during a challenging time for our customers. Turning to profitability. Q2 operating margin was 28%, up over 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by our subscription revenue outperformance, as well as lower expenses due to COVID, including approximately two points of savings of Knowledge 2020 moving to a digital-only format. Our free cash flow margin was 24%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong operating margin expansion, partially offset by higher CapEx and an increase in DSOs. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profit. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business. The highly affected industries we outlined in Q1, which represent about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality, retail and energy continue to hold up well in Q2 as renewals of existing customers remain strong. We also closed big deals in spite of the macro headwinds these enterprises face. Now more than ever, they recognize the importance of digital transformation and the quick time to value ServiceNow can deliver. We closed five deals over $1 million from verticals, including oil and gas, transportation and health care. We also won a large security deal with a U.S. based multinational hotel chain, a customer and one of the most impacted industries. As Bill mentioned, the workflow revolution is underway, and we've adapted our go-to-market playbook to focus on the things that matter most to our customers. When speaking with customers, they recognize the strategic relevance of Now workflows on the Now Platform, one platform, one data model and one architecture. This has kept our pipeline generation very healthy. Our coverage ratio today is better than at the same time last year, giving us high confidence in the second half of the year. The great thing about our business model is that it is resilient and predictable. We have a robust backlog, and we generate 80% of our new business from existing customers that understand ServiceNow is mission-critical. With these attributes and our visibility into the pipeline, we feel confident executing our plans. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year 2020. We are raising our subscription revenues range to between $4.185 billion and $4.2 billion, representing approximately 29% to 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. This range reflects $18 million tailwind from foreign exchange versus our previous guidance. We are raising our subscription billings range to between $4.66 billion and $4.7 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year adjusted growth. This range reflects a $22 million tailwind from foreign exchange versus our previous guidance. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, and we are raising our full year 2020 operating margin from 23% to 24%. This reflects additional savings from travel expenses and the transition of our Q4 Now at work events moving to digital experiences. Many of our learnings from working remotely will have lasting effects on our overall efficiency, giving us the agility to redeploy savings elsewhere. Importantly, we are a growth company with a lot of runway ahead of us. As we continue to feel confident about the long-term opportunity in path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas such as R&D and go-to-market. As always, we will be disciplined as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. Turning to free cash flow. We are raising our full year 2020 free cash flow margin to 29.5%, reflecting the increase in our operating margin, partially offset by a decrease in collections due to expected DSO increases. We remain committed to helping our customers manage through this challenging time. And when required, we've taken measures to provide greater payment flexibility. Turning to Q3. We expect subscription revenues between $1.055 billion and $1.06 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $995 million and $1.015 billion, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year adjusted growth. I would note here that the seasonality of our billings has changed this year due to shifts in the timing of renewals. About $18 million of billings was pulled into Q2 from Q3, and we also expect a proportion of Q3's historical invoicing mix to shift into Q4. I want to be clear, the change in billing seasonality reflects the timing of invoices only, not any changes in the trends of our business. As customers expand their purchases of ServiceNow's products, they often realign the new contract to co-terminate with existing contracts. These changes only affect the timing of our billings and do not impact our revenue expectations. Moving on to profitability. For Q3, we expect a 22% operating margin, which includes some spend that shifted from Q2 to Q3 and increased investment, as we continue to develop pipeline based on the opportunities we are seeing. As a management team, we were very prudent about marketing spend entering into our full first COVID quarter in Q2. However, the outstanding execution we've seen from the team, including the success of Knowledge 2020 as a digital event, has demonstrated our ability to get great returns on our investments. Finally, we expect third quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 199 million and 198 million, respectively. In summary, as we continue to navigate through this unprecedented operating environment, a few things have become clear. Digital transformation is accelerating as companies react to unexpected disruptions and reimagine the future of their business. ServiceNow is the strategic workflow authority at the epicenter of this digital transformation. Customers need us more now than ever, and the organization is galvanized to deliver. The power of the Now Platform has become self-evident to customers. Our customers are innovating on the Now Platform to meet their crisis management, business continuity and productivity needs. We have a world-class management team and the right product portfolio to weather the short-term COVID challenges. We will continue to help our customers evolve, and we'll emerge from this crisis an even stronger and better company. We're in a very strong financial position, exiting Q2 with $7 billion in RPO and E&A strong net cash position of $2.4 billion. We have never been prouder of our employees and their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities. Our Hungry and Humble culture is stronger than ever and we can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, we\u2019d like to now turn over the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Kash Rangan of Bank of America.\nKash Rangan: [Technical Difficulty] for you, Gina and one for you, Bill, if I could. Gina, can you just expand a little bit about the -- on the seasonality of billings? So this is something that ServiceNow has not typically experienced. To your point, your credit, clearly, the CRPO number is rock solid, so is the subscription billings. Just if you could dig a little bit deeper into the emerging seasonality of billings, that would be great. And, Bill, a question for you. Once we come out of this pandemic, what does the demand picture look like for ServiceNow? Are we back to -- in some sense -- some investors are concerned this might be pulling in accelerating spend because of the pandemic, but do you really agree with that and what does the shape of those post-pandemic demand picture look like for ServiceNow? Thank you so much and congratulations.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Kash. So the seasonality of our billings is changing a bit this year due to shifts in the timing of certain renewals. As I talked about in my script, some customers are realigning their new contracts for additional products to co-term with existing contracts. As a result, we expect the proportion of Q3 historical billings mix to now land in Q4. As I also previously mentioned, we saw about $18 million of billings shift out of Q3 and into Q2 due to the timing of renewals. If you add those points back to growth, you'll get a more normalized 20% plus, which puts us at the midpoint of the current consensus. So as again, I want to note, these changes only affect the timing of billings and do not impact revenue expectations or business performance at all.\nBill McDermott: And Kash, thank you very much for your question and your very nice comments. Post pandemic, ServiceNow gets even stronger. And the reason for that is our customers have less limitations around them and their businesses. So you should feel very bullish about our company. Our $10 billion aspiration way beyond that. Here's what I see. The platform, the Now Platform is resonating everywhere. The ecosystem looks at it as a cross-platform integration engine, because there are so many siloed systems out there from the 20th century system of record. We don't compete with them, we simply make them better, so they layer in the Now Platform and enable business operations to execute even without having to change and redo their systems of record. So, that\u2019s a big tailwind and the ecosystem all has multi-billion plans around ServiceNow, and there'll even be very large tech companies that will declare that very soon. On ITSM Pro, we're only 15% penetrated cash, and that is absolutely paradigm that will have 100% penetration. Employee experience, the simplicity of the employee experience has become not just a CHRO, but a CEO imperative because the war for talent is only going to get greater, not less. Premium talent is everything. And we're doing just a great job and employee experience, and we make all the other ones that are already there look better. I see companies with one system of record per 1,000 employees and very consistently. And with us, you just take one portal approach to simplify the whole scenario for the employees, especially with a hybrid future work environment, work-from-home or work from the office, work somewhere in between, we own that. And CSM, I mean, look at the Disney example. The Holy Grail has always been direct-to-consumer where a great product company didn't have to split their money through different channels and different routes to market where they could just go direct to their consumer. Look at Disney, how they innovated with Disney+. I think that example, when you think about virtual agents, you think about machine learning and AI, a platform to run your operations that provides a work order and a work flow instantaneously where customer is struggle with an internet order. So they get a subscription, they went to customer and customer happy experience. And then finally, when I think about CSM, it's the hugest TAM. So we're in it to win it. And I think Disney+ is a perfect example of the bright future for the Now Platform. And finally, look at this, Kash, you know this very well, low code, no code edge application. Our customers are building applications in hours and a couple of days, deploying them to, in some cases, 1.5 million employees within two days. That's the kind of rapid prototyping innovation and development that has to be done, and the Now Platform gives them that. These are major transformations in the enterprise, and ServiceNow will be at the forefront of leading this initiative.\nKash Rangan: Crystal clear and compelling. Congratulations. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you so much, Kash.\nOperator: The next question is from Walter Pritchard of Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. I'm wondering on the ITSM side and ITSM Pro has been, I think, a success, but maybe we didn't anticipate as much as it's been. I'm wondering where you are in terms of the installed base moving over to ITSM Pro? And how much longer do you see that as a sort of tailwind that you've seen it so far? Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Walter. We're about 15% penetrated in ITSM Pro and more than eight out of 10 customers automatically choose it right out of the gates. So we still have the entire installed base to continue to spread our wings in. And what\u2019s really great about ITSM Pro and all credit to CJ and our great engineering team and brining now all the machine learning, the AI, the operational excellence that comes under Platform and you start to get into the predictive world with business automation, with ServiceNow, so that is going to be a huge tailwind for a long time for us. What I really love about it is it opens up all the other conversations with the employee experience, customer service management, the edge applications and then even innovation on the Now Platform itself. So I believe you should feel very, very, very confident in ITSM Pro and the pipeline is soaring.\nWalter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, guys.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Walter.\nOperator: The next question is from Brad Zelnick of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the strong quarter. Bill, I recall when you joined ServiceNow, you assured us there'd be no interruption, and you've delivered just that, even in the face of COVID. But we're now seeing a transition in sales leadership at the midpoint of the year. The timing seems a little unusual. And I just wanted to understand, how much of any of the billings timing that we're seeing from Q2, Q3 and Q4, might be related to any transition of roles? And what if anything might change in terms of go-to-market strategy with the new configuration? Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Brad, first of all, thank you very much for acknowledging that. I know a lot of people thought I was going to pull up the van with crews that I might have had in another company and start making big changes. I found a great management team here. John Donahoe did a great job; Frank Slootman before him and Fred Luddy built an unbelievable company, and I'm proud to stand on the shoulder of those giants. And as it relates to me personally with this team, I'm not making any changes even now. So David Schneider is a great guy, him and I have a wonderful friendship and he's going to be with me all the way to the end of this year. So after 35 years, nine at ServiceNow, he's had a stellar career, by the way. He's still living, but he really wants to spend time with his family. He has an eight and nine year-old and 35 years on the road has been a lot. And he told me when I first met him that this was something he was interested in. So please know that in a certain sense, we're actually simplifying ServiceNow. Because Kevin Haverty, who's now the Chief Revenue Officer, has been running the number to ServiceNow for six years, and he's the guy. So when you think about our sales, sales operations, the industry go-to-market, Kevin had it, he still has it, and all of his leaders are perfectly held in place. There's no change. The second thing with Lara, as you know, she runs strategy for us, a very accomplished person. I just want to give you maybe a little cheat too because sometimes when you run a strategy, you don't know everything about the person. This is a college basketball player for four years as a starter. So talk about competitive. She led, along with Kevin, the go-to-market for our company. She has 20 years experience with CXO level transformations, and she led our M&A events, and she's been my right-hand on so many strategic issues since I've been here. So now she gets to put the value chain together. So our services business, we align presale, we align sale, we align post sale. We align the ecosystem in a value motion to deliver extreme upside for our customers, and she really gets that with the bane background and her experience at ServiceNow. She, too, is a tried, true and proven leader that I was fortunate enough to get to work with when I came here. So no change. The only thing that's mildly different is at the end of the year, David is going to pursue his retirement, spend a little bit more time with his family. But in the meantime, he's right by my side. He'll be focused on sponsoring large customers and mentoring Kevin and Lara for anything that they need. And, obviously, our culture is on fire. Our Net Promoter Score with the customer satisfaction, loyalty and our employee satisfaction is an all-time high. Please know, Brad, there is really no disruption here whatsoever.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome, Bill.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add also that the management changes have no impact on invoicing or billings, right? Our billings guide for the full year is strong, and we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve it.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Bill. That\u2019s it for me.\nBill McDermott: Thanks a lot, Brad.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: The next question is from Sterling Auty.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wondered if you could comment in terms of what you experienced geographically? And specifically, looking at the U.S. results, they look more flattish versus the growth in EMEA, was there any driving factor, whether it's government contribution or others that you would point to?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So we had good growth in the Americas. We had good growth in EMEA as well. We were really pleased with our results for Q2, really throughout the region. Really, they all achieved our expectations, which really helped drive the overperformance for all of Q2.\nSterling Auty: Great. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: And, Sterling, one thing that you may want to know is, EMEA just broke through the $1 billion run rate threshold, which is an exciting achievement. And getting Paul Smith in there to run EMEA, which is a proven enterprise software executive for many, many years in the enterprise space and him leaving a pretty well-known brand to come here, I think, is setting a statement. So we're rock-solid in every single region. We're rock-solid at the top leadership level, and there's nothing but trusted ServiceNow with our customers and our people.\nSterling Auty: Makes sense. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Zukin of RBC Capital Markets.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another great quarter. Just a quick one for me. Bill, it does seem like the core buyer in the IT department seems like they've gotten adrenaline shot here from the COVID crisis. I wanted to ask, if you think about your playbook in this environment versus maybe 90 days ago, what's the playbook to take incremental share? And on the pipeline, if you could comment, typically on the federal vertical, what you're seeing there and in the quarter? And then, apologies for the multi-part question, but could you just help us bridge the growth that you're putting up in kind of current RPO and current RPO bookings versus the adjusted subscription billings growth?\nBill McDermott: Sure, sure. I'll let Gina give you the RPO numbers right. But look, the reality is this. The CEOs of enterprises around the world are going to be doubling down on their investment in digital transformation. They recognized in a pre-COVID world that you had to transform, but in a post-COVID world, you have to be digital to survive. I mean just think about it. Your employees have to actually work from anywhere now, if not all the way from home for quite a while. So digital transformation has hit everybody home, nine out of 10 CEOs have a digital-first strategy, yet only four out of those 10 say I'm ready for digital disruption. In other words, if somebody comes out their company with a digital playbook that's better than theirs. They don't feel ready for that. So this is playing right into the hand of ServiceNow. What's interesting is the ITSM backbone to really be the thought leader in IT in that strategic authority; it carries over to the employee experience. It carries over to the customer service management side, and also in edge applications. Take a great company like Lowe's. In the heart of COVID, they had to basically -- they deal with leave requests with their employees, how do I build an application in less than 96 hours and deploy it to 323,000 people? Well, you do it on a low-code platform like the Now Platform and you get it out there. So you're seeing everything come together now to ServiceNow, because we're a platform company. And I think that's the big breakthrough that all of our shareholders should realize because that platform now, if you talk to Microsoft, it's one of the top six strategic platforms for Microsoft. If you talk to any one of the big six systems integrators, it's one of their top platforms. Now people are realizing, my goodness, the 20th century architectures are too slow in these digital-first environments. How do I get fast? How do I get speed? And that's where the workflow revolution is hitting its stride, because behind every great employee or customer experience is a great workflow. And if you listen to my comments today, it's also security. Because now we have to take the worker and match the IT badge with their rights and privileges and their safety protocols around coming back to the office or having to be quarantine, or allowing their teammates to understand the dynamics of who's in and who's out. This is also happening in professional sports where we're highly involved as well. So all of these forces and more are saying platform companies win in a digital transformation environment, especially if they're born in the cloud.\nGina Mastantuono: And on your question with respect to the RPO, and thank you for noticing such strong growth in our -- both our RPO and our current RPO. The difference in the billings schedule, right, so invoicing schedule will impact billings, but it will not impact our RPO. So this goes back to the comment that I made earlier, that the changes in the invoicing and billing are just timing related and do not impact our revenue expectations or our business performance. And so this is why billings is not always the best indicator. It's just timing and the core of our business remains ever strong.\nBill McDermott: So please, admin, not content and business, okay? Admin. We added handled billings and revenue are fine, margin, free cash flow, growth, everything where you wanted it.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you guys.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho Securities.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats as well on a very good quarter. So it was impressive to see the mix of business from Now Platform on another rise to 13% of total this quarter. And Bill, you talked about the power of low-code, no-code. Are you seeing broader-based adoption of the Now Platform? Or was it significantly influenced by those eight figure deals? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you're seeing clear signs of growing trend here. Thanks.\nBill McDermott: It's absolutely a growing trend. If you \u2013 one of the examples I gave was the U.S. state department. Think about this, they use the Now Platform to create a dozen applications in three weeks tracking COVID for every country around the world. If you think about customers like Petrobras, a global energy conglomerate and Brazil's largest company, by the way. They are using the Now Platform to lead their digital transformation strategy. So it is clear that this idea of internal business process on an end-to-end basis has moved from a system of record idea because they realize the data gets trapped in a solo and a silo to streamlining things in a workflow. So this is how people are looking at product development now. This is how they're looking at process innovation. This is how they're thinking about reducing time from discovery all the way through to actually getting products and services to market. So I really believe we're onto something here, and we're at the forefront of the early days of the workflow revolution.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. And I would just add to that, the launch of our state workplace applications. Goodness. This product was designed and launched in just a matter of weeks. And in the quarter, we saw over 30 deals closed. Now that's product innovation, incredible sales execution and quick time to value-added best. So again, really, really strong traction here.\nBill McDermott: And if I could build on that, Gina, is absolutely right. I want you to know something. We referenced a few names in my comments today. And in all cases, we went against some other people out there that have heavily marketed their brands and their offerings. And why did the customers choose us? They said because you actually have a real product. It's not a prototype. It's not an idea. It's a product. And incidentally, when Uber actually implemented it in less than two weeks, they were stunned and I was very proud to have them talk about that success at our Board meeting the other day. So what you're seeing now is people realizing the difference between marketing and prototypes versus real products and scale.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thanks for the color guys.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Two questions for Bill. Bill, obviously, another strong quarter in sales and marketing hiring. Wonder if you could provide us some color on just what you're seeing in terms of just pipeline build from some of these new hires? And then what is sort of the \u2013 just that strong hiring mean in terms of your confidence for the second half and next year? And then just one follow-up to that.\nBill McDermott: Yes, Phil. It's a great question. What we have done, which is very interesting. If you look at it, we've actually increased the size of the workforce 20%, and we powered right through the first half of the year in the midst of a COVID environment. So we have the feet on the street. We have everyone through shark camp, which is what we call our training camp here. And we also have 323 summer interns that are early adopters to the ServiceNow brands who want to join the company. So we're hiring young, brilliant inspired people to be part of the movement. And right now, we have enough feet on the street to actually achieve our goals, and we're looking at everything, Gina and I, when we go through the math, a year in advance to make sure we have the bandwidth. We're also making sure we invest properly in our engineering strength. And I want to basically say, between engineering and go-to-market, there's nobody that can do it any better than us. So we really are looking at our own ideas, our own ability to invent and then having the capacity on the street and then the marketing savvy and the brand reach to get to people, not just in the Americas but all around the world to get them on the ServiceNow train. So we're ready, and we're going to keep building the machine.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add to that. With respect to our pipeline, our coverage ratio today is better than at the same time this time last year. And so from a confidence in our guide for the back half, as I said in my prepared remarks and Bill did as well, we're highly confident in our guide and our ability to execute in the back half of the year.\nPhil Winslow: Got it. And then just a follow up for you in terms of just the HR. Obviously, you called out a lot of wins in terms of return to work. And obviously, our checks have said a similar thing. How are you thinking about how the return to work impacted the Q2 results, but also the second half? Not just simply, sort of, as an add-on to existing HR service delivery customers, but has a potential to actually drive HR service delivery business?\nBill McDermott: I think the idea there is, the 550 downloads, the 30 wins that Gina talked, proving that we are head over heels better than the offerings and the alternative scenario with other people in the market. We know that. So now it's just a question of how much upside can we get in the back end of the year. It didn\u2019t materially impact this quarter. Its upside, but it's not material. But in the future, I think if you look at employee experience as a holistic part of our business model. You take the core employee experience and now the return to work suite, and there'll always to be the next new innovation on top. But what I'm impressed with, Phil, is every two weeks, we have new releases that keep up with the ever-changing market dynamic. There's two things that are going on here that I really want you to register. Number one, the architecture that others have cannot innovate in two-week cycles and deploy with customers and get big companies running within \u2013 and fully deployed within two weeks. Architecturally, through various things of M&A and other things, they don\u2019t have the clean platform that we have. And secondly, our engineering team, because the Now Platform is so simple, it can iterate on this platform so quickly. So we actually got the whole suite out the door in two weeks. The emergency response apps in March were done in three days, deployed in a week. So that is the difference, the time to market. And so, I would like the shareholders to understand that, that is upside, but not required to deliver the dream that Gina and I laid out.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add also that our legacy HR is performing extremely well as well. At the end of the day, employee experience is more relevant than ever. And the C-suite budgets are shifting really to drive better employee experiences. We closed eight deals over $1 million in HR in the quarter and HR was included in 14 of the top 20 deals. We now have over 750 customers. And Bill spoke about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Goldman Sachs in his prepared remarks. But another win we're proud of is with a multinational pharmaceutical company, who really should -- now to consolidate all of their systems into one portal, to reduce the complexity, because employee drives more self-service and really streamline and automate broken processes. So you're absolutely right. HR is definitely on the forefront of all C-suite executives today.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: And your next question is from Chris Merwin.\nChris Merwin: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the software asset management product. I imagine that's particularly relevant these days with many companies burdened with a lot of tech debt and looking to digitally transform. So can you talk about any, I guess, any updates there and how significant a contributor that might be to ACV going forward? Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Sure, sure. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate it, Chris. As you know, the environment is right for this. There are enormous opportunities with underutilized software assets, lots of shelf ware. And obviously, this also is true in the hardware business and our product addresses both of that. What I would say to you is the rating that I gave you in my remarks; the independent research companies now have claimed us as a leader in the space. And the pipeline in this area is extremely good. Customers have activated us in all the scenarios that I have personally been involved in, they are looking at us in multiple ways. So typically, the software asset management is coupled with ITSM Pro and some other pieces, but it clearly will grow faster in the second half and beyond because of the leg work that we did in the first half, especially now bringing hardware asset management to market, so we can take a holistic look at both the hardware and the software, and both of those products have been raised by the independent researchers as a leader.\nChris Merwin: Great. Thanks so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tom [Technical Difficulty]\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I really appreciate it. Great job on a successful quarter. Bill, I was hoping you could just take a second and address the security product in a little bit more detail. Certainly seems like that is coming up right in the middle of a lot of your strategic deals right now, and security of course is right at the heart of digital transformation. Talk a little bit more about how that's progressing in the pipeline? Who you're facing off against competitively there, and how you're trying to structure these deals? What are the typical sizes of the security deals right now? Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Yeah, sure, of course. Thank you very much for the question, I definitely appreciate it. In terms of our quarter, if you look at it, we had our largest security quarter ever for the company. Security was included in 15 of the top 20 deals. I spoke about Fiserv and JPMorgan, which incidentally, I can speak to with authorities since I was the executive sponsor for both of those great businesses. Another example would be a very large defense contractor that worked with us, they saw a tremendous value in an automated approach to security risk and vulnerability response and all on the Now Platform. So I think what you should take away from this is we don't go in there competing with people. We don't actually compete with anybody. We don't talk badly about system of record. We have no problem with any brands that are in market or any particular security company. What they seem to like the most is as they think about streamlining and automating their workflow, they like to have all of it on a Now Platform. So these are very smooth attach rate deals for us, because it's all in the workflow. And the companies like JPMorgan, for example, as you know, have beautifully run company's extraordinary IT talent, and they really like to combine everything that they do in the workflow itself. One example of a company that I was personally involved in it's as simple as this, an employee comes into a building, they have a batch. That badge is best understood by the ITSM Pro. Anything concerning that employee, for example, their rights and privileges, their office access, their computer access, we know everything about them. But also, we know everything about vulnerabilities and responses and attacks that might be coming into the company as well. And as you know, early detection is a whole key to solving these security problems before they get out of control. All of this is mastered in the Now Platform. So think of us as a platform company, think of this as workflow and everything as a business process or workflow in these companies has to be highly secure. And including the return to workplace that Gina was just talking about, I mean, half of the competitive advantage that we bring is knowing everything about the talent, their rights, privileges and what they should and shouldn't be doing. And that has been a big differentiator. That's why I think the IT backbone of our platform is a huge advantage.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, really helpful. Thank you, Bill. Appreciate it.\nBill McDermott: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. Your last question is from Sarah Hindlian-Bowler of Macquarie Capital.\nSarah Hindlian-Bowler: Hi, there. Thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Good to hear your voices Bill and Gina and congrats on another great quarter. The CRPo growth is really something to marvel at. Bill, I think one question that would be really helpful just to kind of hear your perspective on is, if you could look at your sales \u2013 your sales organization, your pipeline, your closure rates, do you feel better or worse than you did three months ago? And why?\nBill McDermott: I feel much better. I didn't feel bad than I told you that then and promises made, promises kept, but I feel even better now. And the reason why is, I think, people have come to know that the COVID environment is a reality. And this reality is not going away anytime soon, and businesses still have to run. Governments still have to serve their citizens, our partners still have to acclimate in this climate and meet the ever-changing and diverse needs of digital transformation for our customers. So digital business is moving forward. And the digital event we call Knowledge 2020 was double the attendance of the prior year. And I think that tells you that people are looking for content. They're looking for solutions. They need us now more than they ever did before. The other thing that I find very, very interesting is \u2013 can you imagine this, Sarah, being in four continents in a day on Zoom?\nSarah Hindlian-Bowler: No, no I can\u2019t.\nBill McDermott: Right. We have defied the logic of time and travel because of these modern digital technologies. So as a productive person, I think that all leaders would probably tell you the same thing. If you interviewed 100 CEOs in the business council, I think, 98 would tell you they can be in more places in more time zones than they ever could have imagined in the physical world. So I think the whole world is adopting to this. I'll give you another example. If you look at our engineering team, they have written more code, because we have all the analytics on the code and the productivity for engineer, and it's obviously good code. Everything works here. And then, in terms of the customers using our platform, all of the use rates are sky high, higher than ever before. So this is just telling me that people have adjusted. The shock of March has now become a norm, and business is going on. And that's evident in the pipeline, its evident in the linearity. It's evident in all of the communications I've had with our sales leadership, our industry leadership, our various go-to-market teams, what we're doing in marketing, what we're doing in product marketing. I mean people are amped up here. I mean, my biggest challenge here is telling them, hey, you guys got to take an afternoon off, go take a walk, relax. Because they're really just going full speed. So I believe you should feel very confident in ServiceNow today and very confident in the second half outlook and extremely confident in an inspired workforce to get the job done for our customers, so they can serve their customers.\nSarah Hindlian-Bowler: Thank you, Bill. That was really helpful. Gina, I\u2019ll follow up with you on our call back.\nGina Mastantuono: All right, Sarah.\nBill McDermott: Thanks a lot, Sarah.\nGina Mastantuono: Good to hear your voice as well. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Be well.\nSarah Hindlian-Bowler: Thank you\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Sarah.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2020 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. This COVID environment continues to create challenges for many, and we continue to support our stakeholders, our employees and customers in every way possible. Before getting into our strong results, here are a few trends shaping the overarching environment for ServiceNow. This unprecedented environment is breaking physical supply chains. It is exposing the weak links in the old value chains, illuminating how companies struggle cross-functionally to deliver the workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees and partners. The world is experiencing a seismic shift from the obsolete business process evolution to the new workflow revolution. CXOs are using the Now Platform to create new workflows or new value chains, transforming experiences across siloed systems and functions across the entire enterprise. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for workflow. We are trusted sea suite innovator. We multiply the value of existing technology investments. We deliver exceptional time to value, and our customers understand the business continuity and resilience that the Now Platform enables. Driven by these factors and many others, we couldn't be prouder of our very strong Q2 performance. We beat expectations, beating consensus and guidance and became a $4 billion run rate cloud company. We're raising our topline and operating -- and free cash margin guidance for the full year for 2020, which Gina will provide more detail on shortly. We are delivering safe workplace product innovation in two-week cycles, helping our customers succeed and keeping their employees healthy and safe in these unprecedented times. ServiceNow is a growth company. We are becoming even stronger on our journey to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. We remain totally focused on our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Let me share some additional perspective on how we are supporting customers. CEOs and management teams are focused on protecting revenue, improving productivity and ensuring business resiliency. This has turned digital transformation into a business imperative across all industries. ServiceNow is on the front lines of getting companies reopened. We are helping employees get back to the workplace safely. In May, we launched our safe workplace application suite and dashboard. Our engineering teams continue to deliver product innovations every two weeks. These are real products with an architecture that makes it easy to connect employee health data to their employee badges to ensure safety and security in the workplace. More than 550 organizations worldwide have downloaded our safe workplace suite, companies such as Uber, Coca-Cola European Partners and Bank United are using the apps and dashboard to return to the workplace safely. This is the power of the Now Platform, the ability to move fast, be agile, solve problems quickly with low-code, no-code app development, create new workflows that deliver great experiences. We're helping our customers solve for once in-a-generation challenges, even as they capitalize on the opportunities of digital transformation because we offer one platform, one data model and one architecture. Customers see the Now Platform as a smarter way to workflow. Gina will share our full financial results with you, but here are some highlights from another quarter in which ServiceNow outperformed. Despite the COVID headwinds, we closed 40 deals greater than $1 million in ACV this quarter. We now have 964 customers paying us more than 1 million ACV annually. Our linearity was strong. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 97%, demonstrating ServiceNow resilience. Q2 deals underscore the strength of our product portfolio. 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. Customer examples include Equifax, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the State of California. Our core business remains ever strong, with continued momentum in ITSM Pro and growth in risk and security, especially as enterprises focus on business continuity. ITSM Pro led eight of the 10 ITSM deals, delivering customers increased automation and operational resiliency. ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals, 15 of the top 20 deals also included security. We did our largest ever risk deal with Providence Health & Services, which has 51 hospitals, 121,000 employees and 800 non-acute facilities. As a heavily regulated business, Providence is partnering with ServiceNow to manage risk, and improve productivity across their business. Employee experience is more relevant than ever. Our HR business now continues to be strong with over 750 customers, in Q2, we had eight deals that were greater than $1 million. For example, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is using ServiceNow to improve efficiency of their HR shared services and to increase employee engagement. They are enhancing employee communications to support their telework initiative. Goldman Sachs, a long time ServiceNow ITSM customer became new HR customer in Q2. They are using our HR products to provide a more consistent employee experience and to drive cost savings. Creating the best experiences and rapidly scaling digital services matter now more than ever. This is driving momentum in our customer service management business. We have more than 50 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV annually. We are delivering great consumer-grade customer experiences powered by industry-specific workflows. Our Zoom partnership is a great customer example. Zoom's usage rocketed 30 times in 4four months. 30x increase. They're now up to 300 million daily meeting participants. ServiceNow CSM solution is enabling Zoom to scale its customer service operations, providing critical communication capabilities for its rapidly expanding global community. CSM also provides proactive case management and personalized self-service options to help Zoom manage the influx of customer requests. We're proud that Zoom chose CSM and the Now Platform to help manage its exponential growth. Zoom also is using our AIOps capabilities to enable its new hardware as a service business model. Thank you, Zoom. Underlying every one of our products is the Now Platform, the platform of platforms. Let me share some examples of how the Now Platform and products translated into strategic customer wins this quarter. A great example is the U.S. State Department. They use the Now Platform to create a dozen apps in just three weeks, tracking COVID requirements for every country on the planet to keep employees traveling safely. With JPMorgan, we closed our largest IT business management and our largest DevOps deal ever. As they consolidate their ITSM, they are improving their employee experiences, leveraging advanced workflows and Intelligent Automation. We're honored that JPMorgan Chase, selected the Now Platform to drive their digital transformation creating great employee experiences and increasing productivity. Fiserv, a global fintech leader, recently completed a merger and need to consolidate systems and processes to gain greater visibility of their assets. Using the Now Platform, they can now gain visibility and insight into the newly combined infrastructure and their emerging dependencies. This reduces time to resolution, improves customer experiences and reduces OpEx, all while proactively providing better services to their customers. We're also now working with the State of Montana to automate their citizen workflows. With COVID, they needed to evolve face-to-face citizen interactions to remote services. They also wanted to reduce the cost and complexity of asset management across multiple agencies, while maintaining data privacy between all of them. It was our ability to provide a single enterprise platform to service all of Montana's agencies that earned us their trust and their business. ServiceNow is partnering with the world's largest brands. Disney is another example of how the Now Platform driving business model innovation. Ann Schmittm VP and CIO of Disney Streaming Services joined me as part of my keynote during our Knowledge 20 experience with the support of ServiceNow CSM workflows, Disney Plus quickly grew to more than 55 million subscribers in just a few months after launch. During the Knowledge keynote, then share has ServiceNow provided Disney. And I quote, 'an extremely flexible and extensible platform that allowed them to develop a best-in-breed customer health center and best-in-breed tooling for their agents to support their customers around the world.' These customer stories and so many others, are why the industry now understands the magic of a Now Platform and the strength of our core business. Top IT analysts firms that named as a leader in three new markets to ServiceNow, CSM, DevOps and Software Asset Management. We also are honored to be named the overall digital innovation award winner by Ventana Research. Every company has had to pivot in this new environment to continue to engage customers in meaningful ways. I am incredibly proud of how our team quickly pivoted knowledge from a four-day physical event that was scheduled to be held in Orlando, to a six-week digital experience that brought ServiceNow community together worldwide. And listen to this. We reached almost twice as many people globally this year when we did at Knowledge 2019. We also delivered more than 820 hours of content, including 1,100 customer-led sessions and breakouts, building a strong pipeline. As our traction continues to grow, our ecosystem continues to strengthen, our partners play a critical role in accelerating customer digital transformation. For example, we recently announced an expanded alliance with Deloitte, to help customers accelerate their HR service delivery efforts, and to provide employees with exceptional digital experiences anywhere. With customer loyalty and our growing ecosystem, we are increasingly part of digital transformation conversations that give us absolute confidence in our business model and our strategic relevance with customers. Our innovation is inspired by solving the needs of customers across geography, industry and persona, as we shape the workflow revolution; our best ideas are ahead of us. Our overarching focus is clear: innovating for customers as we scale ServiceNow to $10 billion and beyond. Our strong management team and our 12,000 employees will enable us to achieve our bold ambitions. To continue driving our growth today, we are announcing the next evolution of our already outstanding go-to-market organization. We are leveraging our tried, true and proven executive talent to continue our strong momentum. Effective immediately, Kevin Haverty is named Chief Revenue Officer, as he continues leading our global sales organization. Kevin has been with the company for nine years and has been leading our sales organization for the last six years. He's owned the number the whole time. Lara Caimi is named to the new role of Chief Customer and Partner Officer, leading all customer success programs and the development of strategic partner activities. She joined ServiceNow in 2017 as Chief Strategy Officer and has led nine acquisitions. They will both report directly to me. I'm really excited. We also recently welcomed Paul Smith, as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our EMEA business, which, by the way, just reached a $1 billion revenue run rate. Joining us from Salesforce, he has a track record for triple-digit growth. Paul is a great example of how ServiceNow is attracting premier talent worldwide. We are fast becoming the employer of choice for our industry's best talent. Before closing, I want to take a moment to honor David Schneider. David has decided to retire at the end of 2020, after a stellar nine years at ServiceNow and more than 35 years in the industry. David Truly has earned the right to step away and began a new personal chapter in his life. David epitomizes our purpose and values. It has been a tremendous honor to work so closely with such a beloved leader. He is ServiceNow family. He always will be, and I wish him the very best in his retirement. David will remain President Emeritus and an adviser to me until the end of the year. In summary, we are ServiceNow strong. In extraordinary times are born extraordinary opportunities. In this once in a lifetime moment, we are at the top of our game. Our people are rising up to seize the opportunities before us. I'm incredibly proud or our culture, our focus, discipline and execution. ServiceNow people have never been more engaged, more focused on serving the enormous names of our customers. Our partners are with us. The ServiceNow ecosystem is truly thriving. Our brand continues to resonate, and we are creating greater awareness and relevance with the C-suite. I constantly hear how people deeply connect to our brand and the humanity of our purpose. Ladies and gentlemen, ServiceNow is special. We're leading the workflow revolution, which leads the future of our business. Now workflows on the Now Platform. The opportunity has never been greater. We will fulfill our purpose to make the world of work, work better for people. We're hungry, we're humble and we're taking nothing for granted. We're on the move to our destiny to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Thank you very much for your time and attention today. I look forward to your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Gina. Gina? And Kash, thank you very much for your question and your very nice comments. Post pandemic, ServiceNow gets even stronger. And the reason for that is our customers have less limitations around them and their businesses. So you should feel very bullish about our company. Our $10 billion aspiration way beyond that. Here's what I see. The platform, the Now Platform is resonating everywhere. The ecosystem looks at it as a cross-platform integration engine, because there are so many siloed systems out there from the 20th century system of record. We don't compete with them, we simply make them better, so they layer in the Now Platform and enable business operations to execute even without having to change and redo their systems of record. So, that's a big tailwind and the ecosystem all has multi-billion plans around ServiceNow, and there'll even be very large tech companies that will declare that very soon. On ITSM Pro, we're only 15% penetrated cash, and that is absolutely paradigm that will have 100% penetration. Employee experience, the simplicity of the employee experience has become not just a CHRO, but a CEO imperative because the war for talent is only going to get greater, not less. Premium talent is everything. And we're doing just a great job and employee experience, and we make all the other ones that are already there look better. I see companies with one system of record per 1,000 employees and very consistently. And with us, you just take one portal approach to simplify the whole scenario for the employees, especially with a hybrid future work environment, work-from-home or work from the office, work somewhere in between, we own that. And CSM, I mean, look at the Disney example. The Holy Grail has always been direct-to-consumer where a great product company didn't have to split their money through different channels and different routes to market where they could just go direct to their consumer. Look at Disney, how they innovated with Disney+. I think that example, when you think about virtual agents, you think about machine learning and AI, a platform to run your operations that provides a work order and a work flow instantaneously where customer is struggle with an internet order. So they get a subscription, they went to customer and customer happy experience. And then finally, when I think about CSM, it's the hugest TAM. So we're in it to win it. And I think Disney+ is a perfect example of the bright future for the Now Platform. And finally, look at this, Kash, you know this very well, low code, no code edge application. Our customers are building applications in hours and a couple of days, deploying them to, in some cases, 1.5 million employees within two days. That's the kind of rapid prototyping innovation and development that has to be done, and the Now Platform gives them that. These are major transformations in the enterprise, and ServiceNow will be at the forefront of leading this initiative. Thank you so much, Kash. Thank you very much for the question, Walter. We're about 15% penetrated in ITSM Pro and more than eight out of 10 customers automatically choose it right out of the gates. So we still have the entire installed base to continue to spread our wings in. And what's really great about ITSM Pro and all credit to CJ and our great engineering team and brining now all the machine learning, the AI, the operational excellence that comes under Platform and you start to get into the predictive world with business automation, with ServiceNow, so that is going to be a huge tailwind for a long time for us. What I really love about it is it opens up all the other conversations with the employee experience, customer service management, the edge applications and then even innovation on the Now Platform itself. So I believe you should feel very, very, very confident in ITSM Pro and the pipeline is soaring. Thank you, Walter. Brad, first of all, thank you very much for acknowledging that. I know a lot of people thought I was going to pull up the van with crews that I might have had in another company and start making big changes. I found a great management team here. John Donahoe did a great job; Frank Slootman before him and Fred Luddy built an unbelievable company, and I'm proud to stand on the shoulder of those giants. And as it relates to me personally with this team, I'm not making any changes even now. So David Schneider is a great guy, him and I have a wonderful friendship and he's going to be with me all the way to the end of this year. So after 35 years, nine at ServiceNow, he's had a stellar career, by the way. He's still living, but he really wants to spend time with his family. He has an eight and nine year-old and 35 years on the road has been a lot. And he told me when I first met him that this was something he was interested in. So please know that in a certain sense, we're actually simplifying ServiceNow. Because Kevin Haverty, who's now the Chief Revenue Officer, has been running the number to ServiceNow for six years, and he's the guy. So when you think about our sales, sales operations, the industry go-to-market, Kevin had it, he still has it, and all of his leaders are perfectly held in place. There's no change. The second thing with Lara, as you know, she runs strategy for us, a very accomplished person. I just want to give you maybe a little cheat too because sometimes when you run a strategy, you don't know everything about the person. This is a college basketball player for four years as a starter. So talk about competitive. She led, along with Kevin, the go-to-market for our company. She has 20 years experience with CXO level transformations, and she led our M&A events, and she's been my right-hand on so many strategic issues since I've been here. So now she gets to put the value chain together. So our services business, we align presale, we align sale, we align post sale. We align the ecosystem in a value motion to deliver extreme upside for our customers, and she really gets that with the bane background and her experience at ServiceNow. She, too, is a tried, true and proven leader that I was fortunate enough to get to work with when I came here. So no change. The only thing that's mildly different is at the end of the year, David is going to pursue his retirement, spend a little bit more time with his family. But in the meantime, he's right by my side. He'll be focused on sponsoring large customers and mentoring Kevin and Lara for anything that they need. And, obviously, our culture is on fire. Our Net Promoter Score with the customer satisfaction, loyalty and our employee satisfaction is an all-time high. Please know, Brad, there is really no disruption here whatsoever. Thanks a lot, Brad. And, Sterling, one thing that you may want to know is, EMEA just broke through the $1 billion run rate threshold, which is an exciting achievement. And getting Paul Smith in there to run EMEA, which is a proven enterprise software executive for many, many years in the enterprise space and him leaving a pretty well-known brand to come here, I think, is setting a statement. So we're rock-solid in every single region. We're rock-solid at the top leadership level, and there's nothing but trusted ServiceNow with our customers and our people. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Sure, sure. I'll let Gina give you the RPO numbers right. But look, the reality is this. The CEOs of enterprises around the world are going to be doubling down on their investment in digital transformation. They recognized in a pre-COVID world that you had to transform, but in a post-COVID world, you have to be digital to survive. I mean just think about it. Your employees have to actually work from anywhere now, if not all the way from home for quite a while. So digital transformation has hit everybody home, nine out of 10 CEOs have a digital-first strategy, yet only four out of those 10 say I'm ready for digital disruption. In other words, if somebody comes out their company with a digital playbook that's better than theirs. They don't feel ready for that. So this is playing right into the hand of ServiceNow. What's interesting is the ITSM backbone to really be the thought leader in IT in that strategic authority; it carries over to the employee experience. It carries over to the customer service management side, and also in edge applications. Take a great company like Lowe's. In the heart of COVID, they had to basically -- they deal with leave requests with their employees, how do I build an application in less than 96 hours and deploy it to 323,000 people? Well, you do it on a low-code platform like the Now Platform and you get it out there. So you're seeing everything come together now to ServiceNow, because we're a platform company. And I think that's the big breakthrough that all of our shareholders should realize because that platform now, if you talk to Microsoft, it's one of the top six strategic platforms for Microsoft. If you talk to any one of the big six systems integrators, it's one of their top platforms. Now people are realizing, my goodness, the 20th century architectures are too slow in these digital-first environments. How do I get fast? How do I get speed? And that's where the workflow revolution is hitting its stride, because behind every great employee or customer experience is a great workflow. And if you listen to my comments today, it's also security. Because now we have to take the worker and match the IT badge with their rights and privileges and their safety protocols around coming back to the office or having to be quarantine, or allowing their teammates to understand the dynamics of who's in and who's out. This is also happening in professional sports where we're highly involved as well. So all of these forces and more are saying platform companies win in a digital transformation environment, especially if they're born in the cloud. So please, admin, not content and business, okay? Admin. We added handled billings and revenue are fine, margin, free cash flow, growth, everything where you wanted it. Thank you very much. It's absolutely a growing trend. If you \u2013 one of the examples I gave was the U.S. state department. Think about this, they use the Now Platform to create a dozen applications in three weeks tracking COVID for every country around the world. If you think about customers like Petrobras, a global energy conglomerate and Brazil's largest company, by the way. They are using the Now Platform to lead their digital transformation strategy. So it is clear that this idea of internal business process on an end-to-end basis has moved from a system of record idea because they realize the data gets trapped in a solo and a silo to streamlining things in a workflow. So this is how people are looking at product development now. This is how they're looking at process innovation. This is how they're thinking about reducing time from discovery all the way through to actually getting products and services to market. So I really believe we're onto something here, and we're at the forefront of the early days of the workflow revolution. And if I could build on that, Gina, is absolutely right. I want you to know something. We referenced a few names in my comments today. And in all cases, we went against some other people out there that have heavily marketed their brands and their offerings. And why did the customers choose us? They said because you actually have a real product. It's not a prototype. It's not an idea. It's a product. And incidentally, when Uber actually implemented it in less than two weeks, they were stunned and I was very proud to have them talk about that success at our Board meeting the other day. So what you're seeing now is people realizing the difference between marketing and prototypes versus real products and scale. Yes, Phil. It's a great question. What we have done, which is very interesting. If you look at it, we've actually increased the size of the workforce 20%, and we powered right through the first half of the year in the midst of a COVID environment. So we have the feet on the street. We have everyone through shark camp, which is what we call our training camp here. And we also have 323 summer interns that are early adopters to the ServiceNow brands who want to join the company. So we're hiring young, brilliant inspired people to be part of the movement. And right now, we have enough feet on the street to actually achieve our goals, and we're looking at everything, Gina and I, when we go through the math, a year in advance to make sure we have the bandwidth. We're also making sure we invest properly in our engineering strength. And I want to basically say, between engineering and go-to-market, there's nobody that can do it any better than us. So we really are looking at our own ideas, our own ability to invent and then having the capacity on the street and then the marketing savvy and the brand reach to get to people, not just in the Americas but all around the world to get them on the ServiceNow train. So we're ready, and we're going to keep building the machine. I think the idea there is, the 550 downloads, the 30 wins that Gina talked, proving that we are head over heels better than the offerings and the alternative scenario with other people in the market. We know that. So now it's just a question of how much upside can we get in the back end of the year. It didn't materially impact this quarter. Its upside, but it's not material. But in the future, I think if you look at employee experience as a holistic part of our business model. You take the core employee experience and now the return to work suite, and there'll always to be the next new innovation on top. But what I'm impressed with, Phil, is every two weeks, we have new releases that keep up with the ever-changing market dynamic. There's two things that are going on here that I really want you to register. Number one, the architecture that others have cannot innovate in two-week cycles and deploy with customers and get big companies running within \u2013 and fully deployed within two weeks. Architecturally, through various things of M&A and other things, they don't have the clean platform that we have. And secondly, our engineering team, because the Now Platform is so simple, it can iterate on this platform so quickly. So we actually got the whole suite out the door in two weeks. The emergency response apps in March were done in three days, deployed in a week. So that is the difference, the time to market. And so, I would like the shareholders to understand that, that is upside, but not required to deliver the dream that Gina and I laid out. Thank you, Phil. Sure, sure. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate it, Chris. As you know, the environment is right for this. There are enormous opportunities with underutilized software assets, lots of shelf ware. And obviously, this also is true in the hardware business and our product addresses both of that. What I would say to you is the rating that I gave you in my remarks; the independent research companies now have claimed us as a leader in the space. And the pipeline in this area is extremely good. Customers have activated us in all the scenarios that I have personally been involved in, they are looking at us in multiple ways. So typically, the software asset management is coupled with ITSM Pro and some other pieces, but it clearly will grow faster in the second half and beyond because of the leg work that we did in the first half, especially now bringing hardware asset management to market, so we can take a holistic look at both the hardware and the software, and both of those products have been raised by the independent researchers as a leader. Thank you. Yeah, sure, of course. Thank you very much for the question, I definitely appreciate it. In terms of our quarter, if you look at it, we had our largest security quarter ever for the company. Security was included in 15 of the top 20 deals. I spoke about Fiserv and JPMorgan, which incidentally, I can speak to with authorities since I was the executive sponsor for both of those great businesses. Another example would be a very large defense contractor that worked with us, they saw a tremendous value in an automated approach to security risk and vulnerability response and all on the Now Platform. So I think what you should take away from this is we don't go in there competing with people. We don't actually compete with anybody. We don't talk badly about system of record. We have no problem with any brands that are in market or any particular security company. What they seem to like the most is as they think about streamlining and automating their workflow, they like to have all of it on a Now Platform. So these are very smooth attach rate deals for us, because it's all in the workflow. And the companies like JPMorgan, for example, as you know, have beautifully run company's extraordinary IT talent, and they really like to combine everything that they do in the workflow itself. One example of a company that I was personally involved in it's as simple as this, an employee comes into a building, they have a batch. That badge is best understood by the ITSM Pro. Anything concerning that employee, for example, their rights and privileges, their office access, their computer access, we know everything about them. But also, we know everything about vulnerabilities and responses and attacks that might be coming into the company as well. And as you know, early detection is a whole key to solving these security problems before they get out of control. All of this is mastered in the Now Platform. So think of us as a platform company, think of this as workflow and everything as a business process or workflow in these companies has to be highly secure. And including the return to workplace that Gina was just talking about, I mean, half of the competitive advantage that we bring is knowing everything about the talent, their rights, privileges and what they should and shouldn't be doing. And that has been a big differentiator. That's why I think the IT backbone of our platform is a huge advantage. Thank you so much. I feel much better. I didn't feel bad than I told you that then and promises made, promises kept, but I feel even better now. And the reason why is, I think, people have come to know that the COVID environment is a reality. And this reality is not going away anytime soon, and businesses still have to run. Governments still have to serve their citizens, our partners still have to acclimate in this climate and meet the ever-changing and diverse needs of digital transformation for our customers. So digital business is moving forward. And the digital event we call Knowledge 2020 was double the attendance of the prior year. And I think that tells you that people are looking for content. They're looking for solutions. They need us now more than they ever did before. The other thing that I find very, very interesting is \u2013 can you imagine this, Sarah, being in four continents in a day on Zoom? Right. We have defied the logic of time and travel because of these modern digital technologies. So as a productive person, I think that all leaders would probably tell you the same thing. If you interviewed 100 CEOs in the business council, I think, 98 would tell you they can be in more places in more time zones than they ever could have imagined in the physical world. So I think the whole world is adopting to this. I'll give you another example. If you look at our engineering team, they have written more code, because we have all the analytics on the code and the productivity for engineer, and it's obviously good code. Everything works here. And then, in terms of the customers using our platform, all of the use rates are sky high, higher than ever before. So this is just telling me that people have adjusted. The shock of March has now become a norm, and business is going on. And that's evident in the pipeline, its evident in the linearity. It's evident in all of the communications I've had with our sales leadership, our industry leadership, our various go-to-market teams, what we're doing in marketing, what we're doing in product marketing. I mean people are amped up here. I mean, my biggest challenge here is telling them, hey, you guys got to take an afternoon off, go take a walk, relax. Because they're really just going full speed. So I believe you should feel very confident in ServiceNow today and very confident in the second half outlook and extremely confident in an inspired workforce to get the job done for our customers, so they can serve their customers. Thanks a lot, Sarah. Be well. Thank you, Sarah."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter for ServiceNow despite the macroeconomic headwinds created by COVID-19. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, while continuing to drive margin expansion and very healthy free cash flow. Q2 subscription revenues were $1.016 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth, making ServiceNow a $4 billion revenue run rate company, a milestone on our way towards $10 billion. Q2 subscription billings were $1.018 billion, representing 26% year-over-year adjusted growth, driven by solid execution from our sales team. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $7 billion, representing 31% year-over-year constant currency growth. And current RPO was approximately $3.5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. Top line strength in the quarter was driven by continued expansion of our existing customers. Our best-in-class renewal rate remained at 97%, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customer's operations. Our sales teams continue to win large deals in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we closed 40 deals greater than $1 million in ACV, an increase from Q1. What's more, the average size of those deals was bigger than any quarter over the past year, and Q2 was our first quarter in which we closed two deals over $10 million, all during a challenging time for our customers. Turning to profitability. Q2 operating margin was 28%, up over 900 basis points year-over-year, driven by our subscription revenue outperformance, as well as lower expenses due to COVID, including approximately two points of savings of Knowledge 2020 moving to a digital-only format. Our free cash flow margin was 24%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong operating margin expansion, partially offset by higher CapEx and an increase in DSOs. Together, these results demonstrate the strength of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profit. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business. The highly affected industries we outlined in Q1, which represent about 20% of our business and include areas such as transportation, hospitality, retail and energy continue to hold up well in Q2 as renewals of existing customers remain strong. We also closed big deals in spite of the macro headwinds these enterprises face. Now more than ever, they recognize the importance of digital transformation and the quick time to value ServiceNow can deliver. We closed five deals over $1 million from verticals, including oil and gas, transportation and health care. We also won a large security deal with a U.S. based multinational hotel chain, a customer and one of the most impacted industries. As Bill mentioned, the workflow revolution is underway, and we've adapted our go-to-market playbook to focus on the things that matter most to our customers. When speaking with customers, they recognize the strategic relevance of Now workflows on the Now Platform, one platform, one data model and one architecture. This has kept our pipeline generation very healthy. Our coverage ratio today is better than at the same time last year, giving us high confidence in the second half of the year. The great thing about our business model is that it is resilient and predictable. We have a robust backlog, and we generate 80% of our new business from existing customers that understand ServiceNow is mission-critical. With these attributes and our visibility into the pipeline, we feel confident executing our plans. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year 2020. We are raising our subscription revenues range to between $4.185 billion and $4.2 billion, representing approximately 29% to 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. This range reflects $18 million tailwind from foreign exchange versus our previous guidance. We are raising our subscription billings range to between $4.66 billion and $4.7 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year adjusted growth. This range reflects a $22 million tailwind from foreign exchange versus our previous guidance. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%, and we are raising our full year 2020 operating margin from 23% to 24%. This reflects additional savings from travel expenses and the transition of our Q4 Now at work events moving to digital experiences. Many of our learnings from working remotely will have lasting effects on our overall efficiency, giving us the agility to redeploy savings elsewhere. Importantly, we are a growth company with a lot of runway ahead of us. As we continue to feel confident about the long-term opportunity in path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas such as R&D and go-to-market. As always, we will be disciplined as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. Turning to free cash flow. We are raising our full year 2020 free cash flow margin to 29.5%, reflecting the increase in our operating margin, partially offset by a decrease in collections due to expected DSO increases. We remain committed to helping our customers manage through this challenging time. And when required, we've taken measures to provide greater payment flexibility. Turning to Q3. We expect subscription revenues between $1.055 billion and $1.06 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $995 million and $1.015 billion, representing 16% to 18% year-over-year adjusted growth. I would note here that the seasonality of our billings has changed this year due to shifts in the timing of renewals. About $18 million of billings was pulled into Q2 from Q3, and we also expect a proportion of Q3's historical invoicing mix to shift into Q4. I want to be clear, the change in billing seasonality reflects the timing of invoices only, not any changes in the trends of our business. As customers expand their purchases of ServiceNow's products, they often realign the new contract to co-terminate with existing contracts. These changes only affect the timing of our billings and do not impact our revenue expectations. Moving on to profitability. For Q3, we expect a 22% operating margin, which includes some spend that shifted from Q2 to Q3 and increased investment, as we continue to develop pipeline based on the opportunities we are seeing. As a management team, we were very prudent about marketing spend entering into our full first COVID quarter in Q2. However, the outstanding execution we've seen from the team, including the success of Knowledge 2020 as a digital event, has demonstrated our ability to get great returns on our investments. Finally, we expect third quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 199 million and 198 million, respectively. In summary, as we continue to navigate through this unprecedented operating environment, a few things have become clear. Digital transformation is accelerating as companies react to unexpected disruptions and reimagine the future of their business. ServiceNow is the strategic workflow authority at the epicenter of this digital transformation. Customers need us more now than ever, and the organization is galvanized to deliver. The power of the Now Platform has become self-evident to customers. Our customers are innovating on the Now Platform to meet their crisis management, business continuity and productivity needs. We have a world-class management team and the right product portfolio to weather the short-term COVID challenges. We will continue to help our customers evolve, and we'll emerge from this crisis an even stronger and better company. We're in a very strong financial position, exiting Q2 with $7 billion in RPO and E&A strong net cash position of $2.4 billion. We have never been prouder of our employees and their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities. Our Hungry and Humble culture is stronger than ever and we can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions. Thanks, Kash. So the seasonality of our billings is changing a bit this year due to shifts in the timing of certain renewals. As I talked about in my script, some customers are realigning their new contracts for additional products to co-term with existing contracts. As a result, we expect the proportion of Q3 historical billings mix to now land in Q4. As I also previously mentioned, we saw about $18 million of billings shift out of Q3 and into Q2 due to the timing of renewals. If you add those points back to growth, you'll get a more normalized 20% plus, which puts us at the midpoint of the current consensus. So as again, I want to note, these changes only affect the timing of billings and do not impact revenue expectations or business performance at all. And I would just add also that the management changes have no impact on invoicing or billings, right? Our billings guide for the full year is strong, and we remain highly confident in our ability to achieve it. Thanks, Brad. Yes. So we had good growth in the Americas. We had good growth in EMEA as well. We were really pleased with our results for Q2, really throughout the region. Really, they all achieved our expectations, which really helped drive the overperformance for all of Q2. And on your question with respect to the RPO, and thank you for noticing such strong growth in our -- both our RPO and our current RPO. The difference in the billings schedule, right, so invoicing schedule will impact billings, but it will not impact our RPO. So this goes back to the comment that I made earlier, that the changes in the invoicing and billing are just timing related and do not impact our revenue expectations or our business performance. And so this is why billings is not always the best indicator. It's just timing and the core of our business remains ever strong. Thanks, Alex. Yes. And I would just add to that, the launch of our state workplace applications. Goodness. This product was designed and launched in just a matter of weeks. And in the quarter, we saw over 30 deals closed. Now that's product innovation, incredible sales execution and quick time to value-added best. So again, really, really strong traction here. Thank you. And I would just add to that. With respect to our pipeline, our coverage ratio today is better than at the same time this time last year. And so from a confidence in our guide for the back half, as I said in my prepared remarks and Bill did as well, we're highly confident in our guide and our ability to execute in the back half of the year. And I would just add also that our legacy HR is performing extremely well as well. At the end of the day, employee experience is more relevant than ever. And the C-suite budgets are shifting really to drive better employee experiences. We closed eight deals over $1 million in HR in the quarter and HR was included in 14 of the top 20 deals. We now have over 750 customers. And Bill spoke about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Goldman Sachs in his prepared remarks. But another win we're proud of is with a multinational pharmaceutical company, who really should -- now to consolidate all of their systems into one portal, to reduce the complexity, because employee drives more self-service and really streamline and automate broken processes. So you're absolutely right. HR is definitely on the forefront of all C-suite executives today. All right, Sarah. Good to hear your voice as well. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vice President of Investor Relations, Lisa Banks. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nLisa Banks: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for ServiceNow\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Consistent with while we are operating globally, our call today is work-from-home. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our first quarter 2020 results and discuss our financial guidance for the second quarter of 2020 and full year 2020. Before, we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this conference call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of April 29, 2020, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions, including those related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The forward-looking guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts as we know them today. Many of these assumptions relate to the matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to the timeframes for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the impact of COVID-19 on our customers\u2019 purchasing ability and the length of our sales cycles, particularly for customers in certain industries. Significant changes in the future could cause us the modify our guidance higher or lower. Please refer to the press release and risk factors and MD&A in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and our 10-Q that will be filed for Q1 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We\u2019d also like to point out that the Company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, our investor presentation and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. Please note that due to the short-term uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, we have decided to postpone our financial Analyst Day for a future date. We expect it will occur in the second half of the year, so we can provide more visibility into 2021 and the longer term operating environment. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We wish a speedy recovery for anyone affected by COVID-19, and of course, our hearts go out to those who tragically lost a loved one. For the millions of people economically impacted, we\u2019re doing our part to support those in need and to get the world working again. We are truly in this together. Here are the key takeaways I\u2019ll reinforce in today\u2019s remarks. First, ServiceNow is a unique platform, a very strong company. We are well-positioned in this seminal moment. Next, digital transformation was a business imperative pre-COVID with $7.4 trillion of projected spend over the next three years. Post-COVID, digital transformation will accelerate, and ServiceNow is the workflow standard for digital transformation. And most important, the Now Platform, the platform of platforms has become the standard for workflow design experiences. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world in Q1, ServiceNow focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, serving our customers and supporting our communities. Leadership, by example, has never been more important. We never stopped pushing. We will not slow down. You\u2019ve seen our earnings release. We delivered a strong Q1, beating guidance and consensus. We have shown we can deliver. In March, as the pandemic was being felt everywhere in the world, our more than 11,000 employees seamlessly transitioned to a work-from-home environment. I\u2019m so incredibly proud of how ServiceNow employees adjusted. Our team focused, they executed, they delivered. Employees feel motivated, inspired and proud. After shifting to work-from-home, we held our biggest all-hands company meeting ever, a live global digital event, where we laid out our plans to support each other and to serve our customers. Feedback from our recent employee satisfaction survey is also very encouraging. 99% are excited about our future, 95% feel more inspired by our purpose than ever, 98% feel confident in our crisis response. ServiceNow employees are ready to lead. We\u2019re strengthening the amazing purpose culture and character of our company. Our seamless transition to work-from-home is a powerful demonstration of the Now Platform. Our cloud native Now on Now solutions enabled our employees to maintain and often improve productivity. Our Virtual Agent technology, our Now Mobile app, our digitized workflows on the Now Platform allowed employees to easily self manage their work requirements. We didn\u2019t miss a beat supporting our customers. Our cloud uptime numbers remained world class. Cloud consumption stayed high as customers relied on the Now Platform as a workflow workhorse. Around the world, we see the customers who are farthest along in their digital transformation are better equipped to manage this crisis. Companies lagging behind are realizing that they now have a burning platform. Accelerating digital transformation has become a business imperative. Behind every great experience is a great workflow. Today that matters more than ever. The power of the Now Platform has become self-evident to customers in this pandemic. They\u2019re leveraging the Now Platform to quickly deploy workflow apps that enable better crisis management and business outcomes. Our COVID-19 emergency response apps are a great example. These four apps, one developed in partnership with the Washington State Department of Health, and three developed by our own team, were released at no charge at the end of March. More than 5,000 installations have taken place. Washington State, San Francisco and Los Angeles are just a few examples of how we are helping government agencies respond. CIOs are telling us that their teams are using the Now Platform to deliver workflow designed experiences that their companies need now. For example, the Lowe\u2019s Corporation was facing a surge of emergency paid leave requests due to COVID-19. Within 96 hours, they built a mobile leave request app on the Now Platform and deployed it to 330,000 employees. This is what Q1 want was all about, leading, helping our customers deal with reality, helping them do what needs to be done. Let\u2019s look at some of the results now. We had 37 deals greater than $1 million this quarter. That is up 48% year-over-year. In fact, most deals closed in the final weeks of March, consistent with normal linearity. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 97%. We saw strength in the Americas, our largest region. We also saw a strong growth in APJ, despite the impact of COVID-19 throughout the quarter. Our Now Cloud went live in Seoul, South Korea in March, where we signed two new customers, representing major brands. We also saw a strong deals completed in EMEA, despite the challenging environment. Q1 results reinforced the strength of our portfolio. Here this, 18 of our top 20 deals with companies such as Merck, Humana, and Siemens included three or more products. This included our second largest new customer transactions ever, which was signed with a Fortune 50 leading U.S. insurance company. We saw great momentum with ITSM Pro, which delivers increased automation and operational resiliency for our customers. Our business continuity and integrated risk management products continued this strong momentum. 16 of our top deals included multiple IT products. Chevron for example, is realizing the power of the Now Platform by using multiple ServiceNow products across their business to drive productivity. They are now using our suite of IT products and they deployed our HR products to their entire 44,000-person workforce. We saw continued traction in HR and customer service management. Customers such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are leveraging HR Service Delivery to respond to COVID-19. Half of our top 20 deals included HR. We now have more than 50 CSM customers greater than a $1 million, including one of the fastest growing digital streaming services. This company launched an innovative game-changing digital business. They did it with ServiceNow. Our customer service management technology is foundational to helping them scale faster than anyone imagined possible. In Q1, we also landed our largest CSM deal ever in APJ. Japanese based Murata Manufacturing purchased CSM to enhance their customer support, reduce time to resolution and increase customer satisfaction. We also launched Orlando in March, our most innovative Now Platform release ever. Our day one adoption was ServiceNow\u2019s highest ever. Orlando features Now Intelligence, which gives customers unmatched AI, analytics and mobile capabilities across the Now Platform to support any workflow designed experience. Driving new levels of enterprise productivity is what Orlando is all about. The Office of Information Technology at Princeton University, for example, successfully upgraded to Orlando and went live with CSM. For instance, CIO, Jay Dominick says, they moved fast to implement CSM functionality to serve current and prospective graduate students, staff, faculty and other stakeholders. And I\u2019m talking to many CEOs and C-suite leaders worldwide. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re telling me. In crisis, they are focused on protecting revenue, ensuring business continuity, and driving productivity. They want an enterprise workflow platform that delivers ROI in 12 months or less. The good news is, fast time to value is a ServiceNow core strength. The ServiceNow advantage is one architecture, one data model, one platform. This gives us strategic authority to be the clear choice for all customers across IT, employee and customer workflows across all geographies, industries and personas. Our partner ecosystem sees this clearly. And they\u2019re doubling down on ServiceNow. We value how our partners Accenture, Deloitte, DXCEY, [ph] KPMG, and many others have stepped up to support our shared customers. Our Q2 fast start playbook is focused on the priorities that matter most to our customers. We\u2019re engaging our customers like never before. Our Q2 fast start playbook includes five key messages: Digitally scale operations quickly and efficiently; reduce technology debt, there\u2019s a lot out there; ensure resilience for critical business operations; deliver employees the right digital experience from anywhere; and create new workflows fast. Each one of these priorities drives great employee and customer experiences. Last week, in fact, we engaged current and potential customers with these. These solutions, in a global company wide prospecting day were built to drive pipeline. The results were simply outstanding. Our teams delivered three times greater pipeline than any previous prospecting day ever. Our messages and solutions are resonating in every sector and every geography around the world. We\u2019re also engaging customers and building pipeline through our Digital Knowledge event. This launches on May 5th. I encourage everyone to join us. We have six weeks of incredible content and digital experiences for our ServiceNow community. Knowledge already has more than twice the number of registered attendees that we had anticipated in the physical event we planned in Orlando. We expect the audience to keep growing throughout the next six weeks. It is going to be one heck of an experience. And this is a great example of how we have pivoted. We remain focused on delivering our customers and partners the connection, inspiration, and education that makes Knowledge such a special event every year. And most importantly, it keeps the ServiceNow community strong. Hey, I\u2019ve covered a lot here. So, let me recap. We seamlessly transitioned to a work-from-home environment and drove very strong Q1 performance. Our customers are innovating on the Now Platform to meet their crisis management, business continuity and productivity needs. ServiceNow is enabling customers to do what they must do to get the job done. Our pipeline is really strong. Our solutions are resonating. Our customers are asking for more. These are the actions and insights that have informed our outlook. Gina will provide more details on our guidance. She has led an exceptional analysis and thorough bottoms-up effort on all possible scenarios. Our guidance reflects a slightly broader range considering the well known uncertainties our customers face as a result of COVID-19 in the marketplace. Even as I say that, please keep in mind that ServiceNow is strong in all industries across the Fortune 500. And we are confident in our opportunities, our ongoing customer demand, and our solutions, and in the strong pipeline we see in our business. We are aware of the hard work ahead. We are taking nothing for granted. This is an innovation-led company with an incredible team. We have a proven track record and an unwavering commitment to customer success. Ladies and gentlemen, if it can be done, ServiceNow will do it. We are on the move. I\u2019d like to thank you very much for your time and attention. And I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. We had a strong Q1, continuing the momentum coming out of 2019. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for subscription revenues and subscription billings and we delivered another strong quarter of operating profit and free cash flow. Q1 subscription revenues were $995 million, representing 36% year-over-year constant currency growth. Q1 subscription billings were $1.055 billion, representing 32% year-over-year adjusted growth. Remaining performance obligations, RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $6.6 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. And current RPO was approximately $3.3 billion, representing 33% year-over-year constant currency growth. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 97%. The strong top-line performance during this quarter is driven by continued expansion of our existing customers. We also continued to see strength in adding new customers. We closed three new customers that are paying greater than $1 million in ACV. Our cohort of customers paying us more than $1 million annually continues to grow significantly, up 30% year-over-year. We now have 933 customers paying us more than $1 million in ACV. We saw strong profitability in Q1 with operating margin at 24%, driven by our strong revenue performance, and less travel expenses due to the current work-from-home environment. Our free cash flow margin was 39%, benefiting from a seasonally high amount of collections from our strong Q4 billings. Our first quarter results demonstrate our position as a trusted innovator and partner to help our customers digitally transform. Before I move to guidance, I want to briefly discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Many of our customers are now operating in some very challenging circumstances. In response, companies, especially those in highly effective industries such as transportation, hospitality, retail [Technical Difficulty] may reevaluate how they\u2019re spending their dollars. CIO surveys and our own conversations with customers suggest though that software spending will prove to be more durable. We\u2019ve seen companies place a greater emphasis on return on investment and time to value. We remain well-positioned to weather the short-term challenges. And Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers\u2019 operations. We have a strong customer base across almost every industry. And over 80% of our business is serving large enterprises globally. As a result, we expect to sustain our high renewal rate. In fact, we saw many of our customers in the highly affected industries, renew their contract and expand their uses of the Now Platform in the quarter with a large portion of this occurring in March. As Bill mentioned, we entered Q2 with the fast start playbook. And I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed with how quickly we pivoted our go-to-market motion in this work-from-home environment. We\u2019ve seen early success as our pipeline continues to grow and we have been successful in closing business with both new and existing customers in the first few weeks of April. With that said, the challenges our customers are facing, particularly in Q2, have been taken into account in our assumptions. While our customers value the Now Platform and we know they are prioritizing their investment in it, customers may delay new transformation initiatives until we have greater visibility into the future operations of their business. Given the current operating environment, we expect some variability. However, we believe this will be most acutely felt by our customer base in the highly affected industries we previously discussed, which represent approximately 20% of our business. The other 80% are industries that are less affected. We are very committed to helping our customers manage through this difficult time. When required, we\u2019ve taken measures to provide our customers with greater flexibility and manage through the challenges. As Bill said, we are engaging our customers like never before. We have done a rigorous analysis to understand both the risks and opportunities ahead of us. Because of the potential short-term impacts to our business, we have made the following adjustments to our guidance methodology. First, our guidance assumes that the most significant headwinds will occur in Q2 and Q3. We\u2019re also assuming these headwinds will ease and the economy will open more broadly by the end of the year. Second, we\u2019ve increased the guidance range for subscription billings. This accounts for the increased uncertainty of new business, timing of renewals, and billing terms, particularly with customers in the highly affected industries.  While our guidance is based on the current assumptions about the macro environment, we are confident in our updated guidance and believe that by making these adjustments, we are appropriately factoring the risks created by COVID-19. As a reminder, we have good visibility into our subscription billings. On average, 50% is driven by backlog, more than 25% by renewals, and the remaining portion comes from net new ACV. Subscription revenue is even more predictable. Approximately 80% of the revenue that will be recognized for the remainder of 2020 is already contracted and included in our backlog. Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2020, which reflects the impact of COVID-19 and the FX headwinds, as a result of declines in the British pound of 5%, the Euro of 1% and Australian dollar of 12% versus the U.S. dollar. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $995 million and $1 billion, representing 29% to 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $960 million and $980 million, representing 20% to 22% year-over-year adjusted growth. We expected a 23% operating margin, up 500 basis points year-over-year due to a reduction in travel expenses and the transition of Knowledge to a digital experience. For the full year 2020, we expect subscription revenues to be between $4.125 billion and $4.145 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. This guidance reflects a headwind of $52 million from foreign currency and $43 million reduction is driven by net new ACV compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance range. We expect subscription billings to be $4.60 billion and $4.66 billion, representing 23% to 25% year-over-year adjusted growth. This reflects a headwind of $52 million of foreign exchange and $123 million reduction driven by the low net new ACV compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance range. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%. And we are raising our guidance for full years 2020 operating margins to 23%. This reflects savings from reduced travel, lower G&A hiring and then transition of Knowledge \u201820 to digital experience. Looking into next year, we expect our investment in these areas to return to previous levels. Importantly, as we continue to feel confident about the long-term opportunity and path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas, such as R&D and sales. And we expect to maintain a thoughtful pace of hiring throughout 2020. As always, we will continue to be disciplined as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. We are maintaining full year 2020 free cash flow margin guidance of 29%, reflecting an increase in operating margin offset by decreasing collections due to the expected increase in DSOs. Finally, we expect second quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $196 million. In summary, as we navigate through this global pandemic, a few things have become clear. Digital transformation is accelerating as companies react to unexpected disruptions of their business. We will help companies transform the way work gets done. We have a world-class management and a right product portfolio to weather the short-term challenges. We will help our customers evolve and emerge from this crisis even stronger and better positioned companies. We\u2019re in a very strong financial position exiting Q1 with $6.6 billion in RPO and a strong net cash position of $2.2 billion. We will continue to invest for long-term growth. We have never been proud of our employees on their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities. Our helping and humble culture is stronger than ever. We can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, we\u2019d like to now turn over the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter. Bill, I guess, you gave us some great insight on the kinds of customer conversations you\u2019re having right now. Given where you sit and kind of how you\u2019re driving these conversations forward, can you give us a real time look at the pace of business closing right now, in April? You talked about the fast start playbook. Can you just help us understand what you\u2019re facing right now and how you\u2019re pivoting the message, given the breadth and flexibility of the portfolio? And then, I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up.\nBill McDermott: Alex, it\u2019s a great question. As you know, the in-process measures of what companies do in times of crisis cannot be overstated in their importance, and you\u2019re in a race against the clock in terms of how you execute. Having been through a few cycles in my career, like this, it was clear to me that we had to immediately jump in on the COVID response actions we took with the four apps, to work-from-home initiative, the all-hands communication to get people rallied around our customer, and then also, along with our leadership team, galvanize the Company around a Q2 playbook that really sold into what the customer needed in the face of a market crisis. Gina did a great job telling you about the market dynamic that we handle mainly high end customers and the Fortune 500, and 80% of them are in industries that of course feel some effects of COVID, but it\u2019s the 20% that feel the greatest shocks of COVID. So, the stage is set for ServiceNow to perform well. What I\u2019m seeing in the trenches as it relates to April is a continuation to what Gina and I told you about March. From the linearity basis, March closed as we would expect March to close and April has actually started faster than April did last year. So, on a year-over-year basis, our pipeline is bigger than it was last April. And what we actually have in the door is on a percentage basis higher than we had last April. And the forecast is not shaky, it is very solid when you talk to our sales leader, the executives that reporting to him, and you participate in the daily conversations in the trenches, like I do with people that run companies and run government entities. So, right now, things are going very well at ServiceNow.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then, maybe just one follow-up for Gina. You mentioned payment terms or DSOs and investors right now I think are close to scrutinizing customer churn, dollar churn, contract flexibility, payment terms. So, maybe what are you seeing right now from customers, particularly in that 20% of industries that are impacted? And how does that inform some of your visibility and confidence around the guidance for subscription billings, current RPO, and any other factors?\nGina Mastantuono: Sure. Well, I\u2019ll say that we\u2019ve not had any customers at this point that are unable to make payments. And so, our customer base remains very healthy. That being said, we have provided some flexibility and extended payment terms. So, a portion of our company, of our customers and those that are the ones that we\u2019re talking about in the highly effected industries. But so far, it\u2019s not [Technical Difficulty] customer base. We don\u2019t anticipate that payment deferrals or adjusted payment terms will have a meaningful impact on revenue or billing. It is why we have [Technical Difficulty] our cash flow margin guidance flat, even though we\u2019re increasing operating margin by a 100 basis points. We do feel like there\u2019ll be a little bit that will push into early \u201821, but for the most part, we feel very comfortable in our guide on free cash flow and bill. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Bill, if I can. Can you elaborate on how you\u2019re adapting your go-to-market strategy during these crazy times? Clearly, your value prop only becomes more appealing as the entire world pivots to digital. But, how has the field priorities changed, if at all, as it relates to new logo versus expansion business?\nBill McDermott: One of the new logos, Brad, that I mentioned was Merck. And there were quite a few on new logos in Q1. But, here\u2019s a big thing. It might be a little counterintuitive actually, but one of my goals, as I told you in the last earnings call, was to be the trusted innovator for the C-suite and actually to elevate the level of contact that ServiceNow utilized in the marketplace. Right now, C level executives and CEOs in particular are easier to get to than they ever have been, because they\u2019re in their home office, and they\u2019re looking for a good phone call or a good Zoom, and in ServiceNow, they\u2019re finding one. So, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re aligning the presale, especially on the value drivers that are important to a customer in their specific industry, in their specific persona. And on an outside-in basis, we\u2019re studying very carefully, especially in the COVID environment, what we can do to help them. We schedule our team to essentially do -- in a physical world we had what we called executive briefing center meetings. Now, we\u2019re in a virtual world. We simply have the same executive briefing center meeting. Only, we can have many more of them because we don\u2019t have the wear and tear or the difficulty of getting calendars aligned because people have time on their hands for things that are mission critical and things that can give them immediate time to value and the priorities that they care about. And as I said, Brad, they care a lot about protecting the revenue they already have. Obviously, everyone wants to grow, but job one is protect what have. And then, this business continuity thing, we can\u2019t overstate it. For example, there is -- one very large consulting company out there with hundreds of thousands of people. And think about something like asset management and how you get the tool set, whether it\u2019s a phone or a computer or anything the workforce might need to work-from-home physically to them, trace and track it, and make sure that it\u2019s executed well across the value chain. So, think about all those enterprise asset management needs now being managed on a workflow basis between a virtual and a physical world. So, this platform of platforms is really resonating. So, I believe that it\u2019s logical for people to be concerned to say, well, you\u2019re primarily an enterprise direct sales go to market, but actually, it works even better in digital because the activity set increases and it\u2019s just easier to do business with C-level executives now than it ever has been before. The other thing I would mention to you, and I said it in my opening remarks is it\u2019s all about value. Right? The one thing about value that\u2019s changed though is the fuse has to be really short, not dissimilar to 2008. It has to be very, very short. I told you a story about Lowe\u2019s where we had them up and running on something with 330,000 employees and 96 hours. We have people installing ITSM Pro in a couple of weeks. And just compare that to the old system of record world and how long it takes to get the value. So, we\u2019re so relevant. And I want everybody to just think about the old value chains and how they are splitting apart and being reassembled into these end to end mobile first workflows on the Now Platform and how quickly you can get the value, and just how willing people are to engage digitally. And even the order agreements, it\u2019s all digital. You don\u2019t have to go out there and get things signed anymore. So, that\u2019s pretty much the net of it.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks very much. It\u2019s all very, very helpful, Bill. Maybe just quickly for Gina. I think, you mentioned slowing down on hiring. How has the hiring plan evolved since the beginning of the year? And have you noticed that it has gotten easier over the last several weeks or a month or so to find talent?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I would say that -- what I talked about slowing hiring and we talked consistently about G&A now and into the back half. We will continue to aggressively hire [Technical Difficulty]. And in fact, [Technical Difficulty] today have been [Technical Difficulty] hiring in some of those areas. And so, we have really not seen a slowdown to date in our ability to hire and attract really strong talent, which is great. I think, what we\u2019re trying to do is be really thoughtful about hiring [Technical Difficulty] continue to hire for the critical [Technical Difficulty]. I want to make sure that we are well positioned to whether this short-term storm here.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Hey, Brad. I just want to give you and everyone else on the call a little color. Right? To build on what Gina is saying, we\u2019re hiring 9s and 10s. And just to net it out, this is a brand destination that\u2019s super successful and talented people now know about. One example is our Chief AI Officer, Vijay Narayana. Keep in mind, this guy has 15 patents. He ran data science solutions at Microsoft and engineering at Pinterest. We have the ability to attract the very, very best people in the market. And he was getting offers from everybody. And he chose ServiceNow. So, we are -- as we bring in engineers, as we bring in talented go-to-market people, we\u2019re also making sure that they\u2019re 9s and 10s. We\u2019re not interested in 8s and below. We\u2019ll leave that to the open market to rationalize.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nSarah Hindlian: Thank you so much, Bill and Gina, especially for providing us an outlook. I think, we all understand it\u2019s very challenging, given what we\u2019re seeing right now. And sharing your process with us was extremely helpful. And I wanted to ask you a few questions. My first one is for you, Bill. We are hearing a lot about some of our companies. Now, granted, they have far more SMB exposure than you do, but really working ahead of time on the renewals side. And I was wondering if ServiceNow is pulling together a renewals team or some kind of prioritized focus on making sure that some of those distressed customers come through even under potential contract extensions. And then, I have a follow-up for Gina.\nBill McDermott: Absolutely. Sarah, first of all, thank you very much for the question. We really want everybody to know that this Company is all about driving long-term customer loyalty. The sustenance of these customer relationships is everything in the cloud economics sense, but even more, it\u2019s everything in the sense of the ServiceNow culture. We have presale, sale, post-sale customer support, our consulting and partner ecosystem aligned in a value chain. We do this by industry, we also segment it by persona. In the 20% of our customer installed base, most affected by COVID-19, we have a cross-functional team that also includes legal, finance, presale, sale, and post-sale involved in the process. So, we do all we can to make our customers successful. We haven\u2019t had a single down sell. We have been flexible on cash where we need it to be, which Gina\u2019s stated. But, we\u2019re also looking at things that are win-win in the orientation. So, even if COVID were even worse than it is today, we expect it\u2019ll get better, but even if it was worse, we find that customers are realizing that the Now Platform is it keep the lights on technology in these companies, it is a have to have. And therefore, nobody has disputed whether or not they need to renew. It\u2019s just simply a consequence of can we help them get through this very difficult time. So, keep that in mind. The loyalty effect is getting even stronger because customers really are relying on the platform even more. And as I look at the root causes to why companies win and lose, customers have to love that product in good times and bad, and be willing to stick with that product because they really believe it\u2019s essential to their future. And that has been the case in every engagement, even the ones where customers needed our help the most.\nSarah Hindlian: Awesome, Bill. Thank you. That was extremely helpful. I appreciate it, very thorough. And Gina, I just wanted to follow up with a fairly simple question, but an interesting one, especially given the depth of working down on guidance. The fiscal year outlook, the way you\u2019ve cut numbers, was better than I was hearing and definitely a relief to me. And you walked through how you were building the model. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some maybe primary, one particular driver. I know, being the customer success platform is relevant. But, are you potentially also seeing or expecting to see a continued boost from enabling IT operations in a very-distributed perimeter, in a work-from-home environment? And is that the primary driver of the revenue build or is it as mathematical as you\u2019ve outlined?\nGina Mastantuono: I think that as IT becomes the business now, IT ops is going to be super important. But that\u2019s not the only place where we continue to see strength. And so, we did a very bottoms-up, deep dive and we did extensive scenario planning for our pipeline coverage, our conversion, our renewal rate et cetera. And so, it\u2019s really about whether or not, from our original guide, we\u2019re just thinking that some of our customers in these highly impacted industries. We believe our renewal rates will stay strong. But, as we think about net new and digital priorities, some of them may be delayed. So, that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused on when we\u2019ve brought down the guide. We absolutely believe that we\u2019ll be able to maintain our strong renewal rate. We believe that digital transformation will remain, a big priority, as Bill has talked about. So, we feel very confident right now with our current guidance.\nBill McDermott: One thing and I think everybody will be interested to know this. It\u2019s kind of your question, but it\u2019s probably on everyone\u2019s mind. Why is it that we have such confidence? It\u2019s really because the customers telling us they have confidence in us. So, take the Department of Home Affairs in Australia. What they are doing is basically integrating the outdated underperforming, old solutions into -- in integrated platform. And that is helping them simplify their environment, drop down costs and improve productivity. The State of California as an example is a perfect one, because they went for a cloud first initiative. And that\u2019s all about getting stakeholders, vendors and partner agencies to cooperate. And that\u2019s why they chose ServiceNow customer service management. So, what you\u2019re seeing here is a recognition that the integrated nature of the platform, what the platform can do, and how it\u2019s so simple now to plug the processes into something that\u2019s modern, cloud and on the move versus the thing they\u2019re bogged down by in the old 20th century tech. So, we\u2019re feeling good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jeffries.\nSamad Samana: Maybe the first question, and I know you guys have touched on it a little bit. But as you think about customers, with everybody working remotely, I know you\u2019ve talked about the sales motion. But, how about in terms of implementation? Are those cycles moving at the same speed as before? Are they move being more quickly, and maybe what the puts in takes around the ability to do a full implementation from a remote perspective?\nBill McDermott: Yes. That\u2019s actually a good question, Samad. I know initially, probably people had concerns as to how viable that was. But the reality is, it is very viable. And that\u2019s in fact what\u2019s happening. Not only can ServiceNow virtually implement the system but so too can the ServiceNow ecosystem. And initially, there may have been some training that was required with certain partners on how to do that but our substantial partners absolutely know how to do that. And that is the manner in which ServiceNow is being implemented. It\u2019s done virtually by ServiceNow as well as our ecosystem partners, not an issue whatsoever.\nSamad Samana: And then, maybe one more on just the go-to-market with the T&E being down with the events moving virtual, coming out of this and it\u2019s tough to answer but it seems like maybe the customer acquisition costs may just structurally come down over time. How do you think about that as those of us that are thinking beyond this crisis, eventually abating? Do you think that it\u2019ll just allow customers to be acquired more efficiently just going forward? Thanks again for taking my questions, and wish everybody well.\nBill McDermott: Well, Samad, I wish you well too. And I\u2019d tell you are asking some great questions here. Because who would have thought that ITSM Pro could have been implemented by our partners in 21 days or less, remotely, pretty cool. And then who would have thought we would have canceled our Knowledge event in Orlando, which has been the physical event of the year, the epicenter of the ServiceNow story where we expected to have 25,000 people physically in Orlando. We already have 50,000 registered and signed up for our event, our Knowledge event in a virtual environment. And yesterday, our Head of Marketing and Communications who is leading this event and doing a great job I might add, told me that his anticipated headcount now for the event is over 100,000. You\u2019re on a good point here. We might very well learn that companies that are digitally transformed and attracting others who want to be digitally transformed, might actually get some brand recognition power from this and actually a lower cost of sale because of the bandwagon effect. And the second part is our motion on a virtual basis of coordinating all of the pre and post-sale layers I discussed is becoming far more refined than it was in the prior highly physical, high-touch world. So, we might still be able to deliver high value, but do so at a higher volume, in which case, you can lower cost of sales, get more deals and more flow through to the bottom line. I wouldn\u2019t rule it out. I\u2019ll put it to you that way. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much. And I\u2019ll add my congrats on the quarter and glad everyone is doing well. I guess, Bill, just to start with you, obviously, you all are standing out in what is a very difficult economic period. I mean the answer seems somewhat self -- or somewhat obvious, but when you are talking to CFOs, I think when we go out and care about things like CapEx spend, obviously budgets are under a lot more pressure. People are really focused on their bottom-line maybe more so than ever and nervous about their own outcome. So, are you just getting the sense that you\u2019re consolidating wallet share within the IT organization or the organization in general? Are you tapping into new line of business spend that perhaps you weren\u2019t before this happened? Because, I think what stands out is, not only do you have a good quarter, but actually your business seems to be doing really well through a month, and I think that will be pretty unique when we hear from everyone else. So, could you just talk about how you all are maybe just consolidating spend amongst your customers at this point time? Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Yes, sure. Well, Kirk, I want to thank you very much for the question. It\u2019s a really, really smart question because I start every meeting off with the C level executives or heads of government that we\u2019re speaking with regularly, daily in fact, on this concept of behind every great experience is a great workflow. And the Now Platform is a platform of platforms. You heard me say that when I first came into the Company. But digital workflows are becoming substantially important assets within every company. And what we see happening here is we see that the great experiences that every CEO wants for their employees and customers includes mobile web and conversational tools. We see clearly that the IT workflow is also essential to enable employee workflow, customer workflow, and then anything they want to uniquely customize they can use the App Engine on our platform to do it. And having this one platform with one data model and one architecture with by the way no debt, because of how well ServiceNow engineering has been handled for the last 15 years, you\u2019re able to really streamline, eliminate a lot of waste in these companies. And what I see happening is companies are telling me, why would I want to double down on a system of record when I can take the data from the system of record and put it into a new workflow where by the way with the Orlando Now Platform, they can apply machine learning and AI and get the real analytics that they need to drive employee experiences customer experiences. So, it\u2019s actually such a great return on investment. I haven\u2019t seen one scenario yet where I can\u2019t go to a C-level executive and say you ordered this from me today, I gave you five 5x or better the ACV value this year. And then, it\u2019s kind of like, well, why wouldn\u2019t you do it. One customer, for example, in this software asset management scenario, we also do hardware asset management, as you know, said I know that I have fully outdated solutions. I\u2019m under utilizing my shelf-ware and so forth. And I said, we\u2019ll analyze it for you. It\u2019s something we do. We haven\u2019t found a business case yet where we can\u2019t take 20% of the cost out. And the guy goes, really? Why don\u2019t we have it? I said look, if anyone\u2019s got any problem with it, I\u2019ll just split the profits with you. No, no, no, I\u2019ll order from you. So, that\u2019s the kind of environment we\u2019re in. If you want to talk cost, we can take it out. If you want to talk experience, we are the workflow behind it. If you want to talk executional excellence in a virtual world, this is the platform that cuts across all the systems of record, and enables all of the mobile web and conversational experiences to help the employees do their job or inspire the customers to be happy and loyal. So, I really think, it\u2019s relevancy, it\u2019s quick return on investment and it\u2019s making things better for everybody. And I really truly believe, our purpose is helping people and really making work, work better for people is truly resonating at this critical time in the world\u2019s history.\nKirk Materne: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And just one really quick one for Gina. So, Gina, in your cash flow guidance for the full year, have you made any sort of assumptions around sort of invoicing duration changing at all? It sounded like outside of that 20% of the customer base, you haven\u2019t seen any real need to think that way versus trying to get a sense on sort of how you are modeling on that front? Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. As I said earlier, the real issue that we\u2019ve seen, and it hasn\u2019t been tremendous, given that only 20% of our business is with customers in the heavily impacted industries. We are not seeing any real issue with respect to sort of invoicing duration or timing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.\nJennifer Lowe: Maybe just to quickly follow up on the last questions and the earlier one. Gina, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that 20% is industries most directly impacted by the current crisis, 80% is less impacted. But, as we think about sort of the assumptions feeding into guidance, is the assumption that that impact remains relatively contained in that 20% with relatively little sort of downstream effects on the other 80% of large corporations, or are you assuming that there\u2019s some further disruption? I\u2019m just trying to sort of quantify -- or to the extent that\u2019s possible, just think about what happened if things expand beyond the industries that are currently impacted directly?\nGina Mastantuono: So, basically, not only, only 20% of our business in the heavily impacted industries, 80% of our business is Fortune 500. And so, we are not as exposed to smaller SMB type of business. And so, our guide does reflect some lower expectations from what we normally would see our growth on a net new ACV. The bulk of that we believe will come from companies in the more heavily impacted but some as some of these companies still May delay some of their speeding and they look for, we definitely incorporated some of that as well.\nJennifer Lowe: And earlier there was the mention that the guidance assumes things continue to stay difficult for a couple more quarters, but also April, there was some positive momentum on the pipeline front, and things like that. And we\u2019re seeing press about industry is starting to reopen maybe a little earlier than had been feared. So, if we think about the sensitivity potentially on the more positive side, what are sort of the KPIs that you\u2019re looking at in your own business to get that forward look on how things are trending? And if we do start to see things open up a bit sooner, does that get us back to sort of what the guys might have been previously or is there going to be just business that you don\u2019t think comes back? How do we frame out what the upside could look like?\nGina Mastantuono: No, I think that there\u2019s definitely potential upside, if the economy opens up more broadly sooner, right? We think that and we\u2019ve talked about, we are very well positioned once the economy opened up, digital transformation is more imperative than ever. And our customers are really engaging with us like never before. And so, there certainly would be upside in my eyes, if the market opened up sooner. As you know, we are very, very Q4 weighted, and we\u2019re also within each quarter very last month weighted. So, as we look at the actual conversion of the pipe, we talked about pipeline being stronger than ever. Our current conversion rates are higher than normal. And so, we are very well positioned if the economy opens up more broadly to potentially be in a position to have more opportunity versus the current guidance, if that helps.\nJennifer Lowe: Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in and hope you guys all stay healthy. Quick question, Bill, on digital transformation. So, that can mean a lot of things for a lot of people, but also for ServiceNow. Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re kind of tilting your sales approach here in terms of different subgroups, especially in the -- when times are a little bit tougher, people look for a quick ROI, like how have you changed the sales approach over the last few weeks to kind of still do digital transformation, but take advantage of maybe faster projects and faster time to money? And then, Gina, quickly on gross margins this quarter, they were at record levels for subscription. Was anything special in there or what drove that? \nBill McDermott: Raimo, I\u2019ll start this off. As you\u2019ll remember from 2008, the world was feeling very good in September of 2008 about things until the crisis hit on the financial level. That was pretty substantial. And that was when cloud solutions that offered OpEx first CapEx and fast time to value really became the ultimate move for the enterprise. Because the power moved across the management team, the CEO basically said, do what you have to do to get the job done, do it on your budget, and CapEx slowed and cloud took over as the pervasive computing theme of the 21st century at that moment. In our case, we\u2019re already a pure play born in the cloud market leader. So, what do you do? We essentially wrote a playbook with five main plays that do what you said, take our platform and our market leading solutions and shape them in a way that gives customers what they need fast. So, digitally scaling your operations quickly and efficiently as an example combines our CSM, our ITSM Pro, and our mobile capabilities and our ITOM capabilities in one out of the box pre-packaged solution that\u2019s ready to run. If you want to reduce your technology debt, we have our SAM, Software Asset Management, the Cloud Insights and application management tool out of the box ready to run. If you want to ensure resilience for your critical business operations, we have governance risk compliance, IT operations and security operations out of the box ready to run. And we do this for the employees. We also do this when you\u2019re building any workflow. So, for the employees, you want the right digital experience from anywhere. You listen to any CEO on the business council calls, and that\u2019s what they want. You need the right digital experience for my people anywhere. So we have the Human Resource Service Delivery Pro, ready to go out of the box. It\u2019s all mobile, and it\u2019s ready to run. And, of course, I talked earlier in my remarks about asset management. You have to get the assets to the people where they\u2019re physically located. And you have to track and trace this stuff as well. Again, out of the box ready to go. And finally, on creating new workflows fast when you need them most, the App Engine is now a soaring component of the ServiceNow Platform. And I think we really kicked off a new awareness for that with our COVID-19 apps. People are like, wow! I can do my own app? And I can do it at mass scale with that kind of speed? Are you kidding? We built them in three days. I had one CEO who was fascinating, said, my goodness! I was trying to do an employee rewards program, because I want to get a great score on Glassdoor. And on ServiceNow, I had a business analyst do it in three days. So, everything we do is super fast, out of the box, ready to go and we align the whole value chain within our company to provide that to customers in a virtual world.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: And on your question with gross margins, we did see higher gross margins in the quarter of about 87%. That was really driven by a greater mix of self-hosted revenue during the quarter. We expect that our guidance for the full year, that\u2019ll be more normalized at 86%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nPhil Winslow: Hey. Thanks guys, for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. And above all, glad to hear that all of you are healthy and I hope the same for your families and your team. Bill, question for you first. Obviously, as you mentioned, you\u2019ve seen a lot of downturns like this in past over the course of your career. And frankly you\u2019ve actually sold a lot of different software products, HR, financial, CRM, obviously now ITOM and ITSM. Would you talk to you executives, how you think the focus sort of within these segments has changed and priorities versus maybe a past downturns? And then, I just have one follow-up for you, Gina.\nBill McDermott: Phil, I think -- and first of all, thank you for your question and safety and wellness to your family. Please give everybody my best, Phil. Executives today are very keen on digital transformation. You can\u2019t go to any meeting where a CEO among CEOs isn\u2019t in some way trying to digitize their company and trying to make sure that digital transformation is at the top of their to do list because they know, if they\u2019re not digitally transform and their competitors are, they\u2019re going to get wiped out. So, this is where the action is. We\u2019re in the sweet spot. And we don\u2019t have to sort of explain that. Now ServiceNow is hitting the main stage with the biggest companies in tech. And we have a very prized position, because the problem with systems of record and the technologies of the past is they do one thing well in a specific domain. It\u2019s not that that\u2019s unimportant, but those investments have been made. So, the CEOs that I talk to, want us to help make those investments work better. And that\u2019s where the platform of platforms comes in. Because we\u2019re so well positioned to take all the investments they\u2019ve already made and enable them to do what they want done, which is to create workflows and inspire their people and provide outstanding service to their customers. And Phil, one of the big learnings in CRM as an example, the engagement layer has been well-penetrated. We all understand SFA, we all understand marketing, we all understand upsell, cross-sell engagement. But what hasn\u2019t been done so well is mid-office operations, how does a healthcare provider take care of 50 million claims and make sure things are done well for each and every constituent, or it could be making sure on field service level for example, deep analytics and machine learning is applied to understand how things can be corrected remotely. But, when you do have to manage an incident, it\u2019s done with the right person, the right tool set, the right training with the right preparation. So, when they do activate a resolution process, the productivity curve goes way up the customer satisfaction, loyalty effect hits. Now, you\u2019ve also seen virtual agent on the platform where we can handle 50 million plus consumers at any one given time on the internet. So, it\u2019s really evolved, and ServiceNow is leading in digital transformation. And workflow is hitting mainstream awareness, which is a new curve for CEOs, and they like it.\nPhil Winslow: And then, when you think about the sales and marketing line, obviously, we saw a pretty significant jump in headcount this quarter. One of the things that you\u2019ve talked about is needing more distribution for broadening product set. So, I guess to jump off for Bill and Gina, how you think about just headcount there in that line going forward as you balance sort of the long-term growth potential, but also maybe near-term productivity?\nBill McDermott: Yes. Maybe what I could do is just start off and then I\u2019ll let Gina pick it up. So, here\u2019s the deal. We have the platform of platforms. You know, we are doing fantastic in ITSM, there\u2019s no question about all the solutions in that portfolio. Employee is taking off like a rocket and continues to grow. Incidentally, we\u2019re very supportive of the systems of record out there. And that\u2019s also helpful to the customer. Because we hide all the complexity and make the user experience great. On CSM, as I mentioned to you, we can handle the engagement layer, the mid-office, or the field service layer, like no one in the market. But, if there\u2019s someone already entrenched in a certain account, we have no quarrel with that. We just make everything that they do work better. And then, there\u2019s of course the App Engine. What I see as our priority is to make sure we align the value chain by industry and persona in every geography, and we go-to-market with tremendous consistency and meticulous attention to detail in the presale sale, post-sale customer support, service and ecosystem. And that motion is completely aligned. And now, I think the virtual environment is the best way to do it at mass scale, quite frankly. I think, we all learned that in this crisis. Now, in the past, we would invent a new product or a new line, and then have to have a specialist sales force to support. I think more and more, we\u2019re going to be able to do that with our core sales professionals, because we\u2019re finding a new level of expertise in pre shaping these things, in training on these things, and aligning the value chain. So, over time, I think we\u2019ll get more done with less, as opposed to every time we want more, we have to add more. And that\u2019s the mentality we\u2019re putting into this. That\u2019s why we\u2019re only hiring 10s maybe 9s that have high potential. Gina?\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Bill. Yes. I would just say that you\u2019re right. We have strong growth in our sales and marketing headcount in Q1. It was the strongest sales hiring quarter ever. And we continue to invest aggressively in our long-term growth in both sales and marketing as well as R&D. I would also say that we\u2019ve also seen strong productivity, which tells us we\u2019re getting good yield on a hiring investment made and affords us the ability to maintain these aggressive targets. So, we feel good, we will continue to invest here and continue to drive the long-term growth trajectory of the business.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. Let me begin by extending my hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. We wish a speedy recovery for anyone affected by COVID-19, and of course, our hearts go out to those who tragically lost a loved one. For the millions of people economically impacted, we're doing our part to support those in need and to get the world working again. We are truly in this together. Here are the key takeaways I'll reinforce in today's remarks. First, ServiceNow is a unique platform, a very strong company. We are well-positioned in this seminal moment. Next, digital transformation was a business imperative pre-COVID with $7.4 trillion of projected spend over the next three years. Post-COVID, digital transformation will accelerate, and ServiceNow is the workflow standard for digital transformation. And most important, the Now Platform, the platform of platforms has become the standard for workflow design experiences. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world in Q1, ServiceNow focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, serving our customers and supporting our communities. Leadership, by example, has never been more important. We never stopped pushing. We will not slow down. You've seen our earnings release. We delivered a strong Q1, beating guidance and consensus. We have shown we can deliver. In March, as the pandemic was being felt everywhere in the world, our more than 11,000 employees seamlessly transitioned to a work-from-home environment. I'm so incredibly proud of how ServiceNow employees adjusted. Our team focused, they executed, they delivered. Employees feel motivated, inspired and proud. After shifting to work-from-home, we held our biggest all-hands company meeting ever, a live global digital event, where we laid out our plans to support each other and to serve our customers. Feedback from our recent employee satisfaction survey is also very encouraging. 99% are excited about our future, 95% feel more inspired by our purpose than ever, 98% feel confident in our crisis response. ServiceNow employees are ready to lead. We're strengthening the amazing purpose culture and character of our company. Our seamless transition to work-from-home is a powerful demonstration of the Now Platform. Our cloud native Now on Now solutions enabled our employees to maintain and often improve productivity. Our Virtual Agent technology, our Now Mobile app, our digitized workflows on the Now Platform allowed employees to easily self manage their work requirements. We didn't miss a beat supporting our customers. Our cloud uptime numbers remained world class. Cloud consumption stayed high as customers relied on the Now Platform as a workflow workhorse. Around the world, we see the customers who are farthest along in their digital transformation are better equipped to manage this crisis. Companies lagging behind are realizing that they now have a burning platform. Accelerating digital transformation has become a business imperative. Behind every great experience is a great workflow. Today that matters more than ever. The power of the Now Platform has become self-evident to customers in this pandemic. They're leveraging the Now Platform to quickly deploy workflow apps that enable better crisis management and business outcomes. Our COVID-19 emergency response apps are a great example. These four apps, one developed in partnership with the Washington State Department of Health, and three developed by our own team, were released at no charge at the end of March. More than 5,000 installations have taken place. Washington State, San Francisco and Los Angeles are just a few examples of how we are helping government agencies respond. CIOs are telling us that their teams are using the Now Platform to deliver workflow designed experiences that their companies need now. For example, the Lowe's Corporation was facing a surge of emergency paid leave requests due to COVID-19. Within 96 hours, they built a mobile leave request app on the Now Platform and deployed it to 330,000 employees. This is what Q1 want was all about, leading, helping our customers deal with reality, helping them do what needs to be done. Let's look at some of the results now. We had 37 deals greater than $1 million this quarter. That is up 48% year-over-year. In fact, most deals closed in the final weeks of March, consistent with normal linearity. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 97%. We saw strength in the Americas, our largest region. We also saw a strong growth in APJ, despite the impact of COVID-19 throughout the quarter. Our Now Cloud went live in Seoul, South Korea in March, where we signed two new customers, representing major brands. We also saw a strong deals completed in EMEA, despite the challenging environment. Q1 results reinforced the strength of our portfolio. Here this, 18 of our top 20 deals with companies such as Merck, Humana, and Siemens included three or more products. This included our second largest new customer transactions ever, which was signed with a Fortune 50 leading U.S. insurance company. We saw great momentum with ITSM Pro, which delivers increased automation and operational resiliency for our customers. Our business continuity and integrated risk management products continued this strong momentum. 16 of our top deals included multiple IT products. Chevron for example, is realizing the power of the Now Platform by using multiple ServiceNow products across their business to drive productivity. They are now using our suite of IT products and they deployed our HR products to their entire 44,000-person workforce. We saw continued traction in HR and customer service management. Customers such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are leveraging HR Service Delivery to respond to COVID-19. Half of our top 20 deals included HR. We now have more than 50 CSM customers greater than a $1 million, including one of the fastest growing digital streaming services. This company launched an innovative game-changing digital business. They did it with ServiceNow. Our customer service management technology is foundational to helping them scale faster than anyone imagined possible. In Q1, we also landed our largest CSM deal ever in APJ. Japanese based Murata Manufacturing purchased CSM to enhance their customer support, reduce time to resolution and increase customer satisfaction. We also launched Orlando in March, our most innovative Now Platform release ever. Our day one adoption was ServiceNow's highest ever. Orlando features Now Intelligence, which gives customers unmatched AI, analytics and mobile capabilities across the Now Platform to support any workflow designed experience. Driving new levels of enterprise productivity is what Orlando is all about. The Office of Information Technology at Princeton University, for example, successfully upgraded to Orlando and went live with CSM. For instance, CIO, Jay Dominick says, they moved fast to implement CSM functionality to serve current and prospective graduate students, staff, faculty and other stakeholders. And I'm talking to many CEOs and C-suite leaders worldwide. Here's what they're telling me. In crisis, they are focused on protecting revenue, ensuring business continuity, and driving productivity. They want an enterprise workflow platform that delivers ROI in 12 months or less. The good news is, fast time to value is a ServiceNow core strength. The ServiceNow advantage is one architecture, one data model, one platform. This gives us strategic authority to be the clear choice for all customers across IT, employee and customer workflows across all geographies, industries and personas. Our partner ecosystem sees this clearly. And they're doubling down on ServiceNow. We value how our partners Accenture, Deloitte, DXCEY, [ph] KPMG, and many others have stepped up to support our shared customers. Our Q2 fast start playbook is focused on the priorities that matter most to our customers. We're engaging our customers like never before. Our Q2 fast start playbook includes five key messages: Digitally scale operations quickly and efficiently; reduce technology debt, there's a lot out there; ensure resilience for critical business operations; deliver employees the right digital experience from anywhere; and create new workflows fast. Each one of these priorities drives great employee and customer experiences. Last week, in fact, we engaged current and potential customers with these. These solutions, in a global company wide prospecting day were built to drive pipeline. The results were simply outstanding. Our teams delivered three times greater pipeline than any previous prospecting day ever. Our messages and solutions are resonating in every sector and every geography around the world. We're also engaging customers and building pipeline through our Digital Knowledge event. This launches on May 5th. I encourage everyone to join us. We have six weeks of incredible content and digital experiences for our ServiceNow community. Knowledge already has more than twice the number of registered attendees that we had anticipated in the physical event we planned in Orlando. We expect the audience to keep growing throughout the next six weeks. It is going to be one heck of an experience. And this is a great example of how we have pivoted. We remain focused on delivering our customers and partners the connection, inspiration, and education that makes Knowledge such a special event every year. And most importantly, it keeps the ServiceNow community strong. Hey, I've covered a lot here. So, let me recap. We seamlessly transitioned to a work-from-home environment and drove very strong Q1 performance. Our customers are innovating on the Now Platform to meet their crisis management, business continuity and productivity needs. ServiceNow is enabling customers to do what they must do to get the job done. Our pipeline is really strong. Our solutions are resonating. Our customers are asking for more. These are the actions and insights that have informed our outlook. Gina will provide more details on our guidance. She has led an exceptional analysis and thorough bottoms-up effort on all possible scenarios. Our guidance reflects a slightly broader range considering the well known uncertainties our customers face as a result of COVID-19 in the marketplace. Even as I say that, please keep in mind that ServiceNow is strong in all industries across the Fortune 500. And we are confident in our opportunities, our ongoing customer demand, and our solutions, and in the strong pipeline we see in our business. We are aware of the hard work ahead. We are taking nothing for granted. This is an innovation-led company with an incredible team. We have a proven track record and an unwavering commitment to customer success. Ladies and gentlemen, if it can be done, ServiceNow will do it. We are on the move. I'd like to thank you very much for your time and attention. And I'll now turn over the call to Gina. Alex, it's a great question. As you know, the in-process measures of what companies do in times of crisis cannot be overstated in their importance, and you're in a race against the clock in terms of how you execute. Having been through a few cycles in my career, like this, it was clear to me that we had to immediately jump in on the COVID response actions we took with the four apps, to work-from-home initiative, the all-hands communication to get people rallied around our customer, and then also, along with our leadership team, galvanize the Company around a Q2 playbook that really sold into what the customer needed in the face of a market crisis. Gina did a great job telling you about the market dynamic that we handle mainly high end customers and the Fortune 500, and 80% of them are in industries that of course feel some effects of COVID, but it's the 20% that feel the greatest shocks of COVID. So, the stage is set for ServiceNow to perform well. What I'm seeing in the trenches as it relates to April is a continuation to what Gina and I told you about March. From the linearity basis, March closed as we would expect March to close and April has actually started faster than April did last year. So, on a year-over-year basis, our pipeline is bigger than it was last April. And what we actually have in the door is on a percentage basis higher than we had last April. And the forecast is not shaky, it is very solid when you talk to our sales leader, the executives that reporting to him, and you participate in the daily conversations in the trenches, like I do with people that run companies and run government entities. So, right now, things are going very well at ServiceNow. One of the new logos, Brad, that I mentioned was Merck. And there were quite a few on new logos in Q1. But, here's a big thing. It might be a little counterintuitive actually, but one of my goals, as I told you in the last earnings call, was to be the trusted innovator for the C-suite and actually to elevate the level of contact that ServiceNow utilized in the marketplace. Right now, C level executives and CEOs in particular are easier to get to than they ever have been, because they're in their home office, and they're looking for a good phone call or a good Zoom, and in ServiceNow, they're finding one. So, what we're doing is we're aligning the presale, especially on the value drivers that are important to a customer in their specific industry, in their specific persona. And on an outside-in basis, we're studying very carefully, especially in the COVID environment, what we can do to help them. We schedule our team to essentially do -- in a physical world we had what we called executive briefing center meetings. Now, we're in a virtual world. We simply have the same executive briefing center meeting. Only, we can have many more of them because we don't have the wear and tear or the difficulty of getting calendars aligned because people have time on their hands for things that are mission critical and things that can give them immediate time to value and the priorities that they care about. And as I said, Brad, they care a lot about protecting the revenue they already have. Obviously, everyone wants to grow, but job one is protect what have. And then, this business continuity thing, we can't overstate it. For example, there is -- one very large consulting company out there with hundreds of thousands of people. And think about something like asset management and how you get the tool set, whether it's a phone or a computer or anything the workforce might need to work-from-home physically to them, trace and track it, and make sure that it's executed well across the value chain. So, think about all those enterprise asset management needs now being managed on a workflow basis between a virtual and a physical world. So, this platform of platforms is really resonating. So, I believe that it's logical for people to be concerned to say, well, you're primarily an enterprise direct sales go to market, but actually, it works even better in digital because the activity set increases and it's just easier to do business with C-level executives now than it ever has been before. The other thing I would mention to you, and I said it in my opening remarks is it's all about value. Right? The one thing about value that's changed though is the fuse has to be really short, not dissimilar to 2008. It has to be very, very short. I told you a story about Lowe's where we had them up and running on something with 330,000 employees and 96 hours. We have people installing ITSM Pro in a couple of weeks. And just compare that to the old system of record world and how long it takes to get the value. So, we're so relevant. And I want everybody to just think about the old value chains and how they are splitting apart and being reassembled into these end to end mobile first workflows on the Now Platform and how quickly you can get the value, and just how willing people are to engage digitally. And even the order agreements, it's all digital. You don't have to go out there and get things signed anymore. So, that's pretty much the net of it. Hey, Brad. I just want to give you and everyone else on the call a little color. Right? To build on what Gina is saying, we're hiring 9s and 10s. And just to net it out, this is a brand destination that's super successful and talented people now know about. One example is our Chief AI Officer, Vijay Narayana. Keep in mind, this guy has 15 patents. He ran data science solutions at Microsoft and engineering at Pinterest. We have the ability to attract the very, very best people in the market. And he was getting offers from everybody. And he chose ServiceNow. So, we are -- as we bring in engineers, as we bring in talented go-to-market people, we're also making sure that they're 9s and 10s. We're not interested in 8s and below. We'll leave that to the open market to rationalize. Absolutely. Sarah, first of all, thank you very much for the question. We really want everybody to know that this Company is all about driving long-term customer loyalty. The sustenance of these customer relationships is everything in the cloud economics sense, but even more, it's everything in the sense of the ServiceNow culture. We have presale, sale, post-sale customer support, our consulting and partner ecosystem aligned in a value chain. We do this by industry, we also segment it by persona. In the 20% of our customer installed base, most affected by COVID-19, we have a cross-functional team that also includes legal, finance, presale, sale, and post-sale involved in the process. So, we do all we can to make our customers successful. We haven't had a single down sell. We have been flexible on cash where we need it to be, which Gina's stated. But, we're also looking at things that are win-win in the orientation. So, even if COVID were even worse than it is today, we expect it'll get better, but even if it was worse, we find that customers are realizing that the Now Platform is it keep the lights on technology in these companies, it is a have to have. And therefore, nobody has disputed whether or not they need to renew. It's just simply a consequence of can we help them get through this very difficult time. So, keep that in mind. The loyalty effect is getting even stronger because customers really are relying on the platform even more. And as I look at the root causes to why companies win and lose, customers have to love that product in good times and bad, and be willing to stick with that product because they really believe it's essential to their future. And that has been the case in every engagement, even the ones where customers needed our help the most. One thing and I think everybody will be interested to know this. It's kind of your question, but it's probably on everyone's mind. Why is it that we have such confidence? It's really because the customers telling us they have confidence in us. So, take the Department of Home Affairs in Australia. What they are doing is basically integrating the outdated underperforming, old solutions into -- in integrated platform. And that is helping them simplify their environment, drop down costs and improve productivity. The State of California as an example is a perfect one, because they went for a cloud first initiative. And that's all about getting stakeholders, vendors and partner agencies to cooperate. And that's why they chose ServiceNow customer service management. So, what you're seeing here is a recognition that the integrated nature of the platform, what the platform can do, and how it's so simple now to plug the processes into something that's modern, cloud and on the move versus the thing they're bogged down by in the old 20th century tech. So, we're feeling good. Yes. That's actually a good question, Samad. I know initially, probably people had concerns as to how viable that was. But the reality is, it is very viable. And that's in fact what's happening. Not only can ServiceNow virtually implement the system but so too can the ServiceNow ecosystem. And initially, there may have been some training that was required with certain partners on how to do that but our substantial partners absolutely know how to do that. And that is the manner in which ServiceNow is being implemented. It's done virtually by ServiceNow as well as our ecosystem partners, not an issue whatsoever. Well, Samad, I wish you well too. And I'd tell you are asking some great questions here. Because who would have thought that ITSM Pro could have been implemented by our partners in 21 days or less, remotely, pretty cool. And then who would have thought we would have canceled our Knowledge event in Orlando, which has been the physical event of the year, the epicenter of the ServiceNow story where we expected to have 25,000 people physically in Orlando. We already have 50,000 registered and signed up for our event, our Knowledge event in a virtual environment. And yesterday, our Head of Marketing and Communications who is leading this event and doing a great job I might add, told me that his anticipated headcount now for the event is over 100,000. You're on a good point here. We might very well learn that companies that are digitally transformed and attracting others who want to be digitally transformed, might actually get some brand recognition power from this and actually a lower cost of sale because of the bandwagon effect. And the second part is our motion on a virtual basis of coordinating all of the pre and post-sale layers I discussed is becoming far more refined than it was in the prior highly physical, high-touch world. So, we might still be able to deliver high value, but do so at a higher volume, in which case, you can lower cost of sales, get more deals and more flow through to the bottom line. I wouldn't rule it out. I'll put it to you that way. Yes, sure. Well, Kirk, I want to thank you very much for the question. It's a really, really smart question because I start every meeting off with the C level executives or heads of government that we're speaking with regularly, daily in fact, on this concept of behind every great experience is a great workflow. And the Now Platform is a platform of platforms. You heard me say that when I first came into the Company. But digital workflows are becoming substantially important assets within every company. And what we see happening here is we see that the great experiences that every CEO wants for their employees and customers includes mobile web and conversational tools. We see clearly that the IT workflow is also essential to enable employee workflow, customer workflow, and then anything they want to uniquely customize they can use the App Engine on our platform to do it. And having this one platform with one data model and one architecture with by the way no debt, because of how well ServiceNow engineering has been handled for the last 15 years, you're able to really streamline, eliminate a lot of waste in these companies. And what I see happening is companies are telling me, why would I want to double down on a system of record when I can take the data from the system of record and put it into a new workflow where by the way with the Orlando Now Platform, they can apply machine learning and AI and get the real analytics that they need to drive employee experiences customer experiences. So, it's actually such a great return on investment. I haven't seen one scenario yet where I can't go to a C-level executive and say you ordered this from me today, I gave you five 5x or better the ACV value this year. And then, it's kind of like, well, why wouldn't you do it. One customer, for example, in this software asset management scenario, we also do hardware asset management, as you know, said I know that I have fully outdated solutions. I'm under utilizing my shelf-ware and so forth. And I said, we'll analyze it for you. It's something we do. We haven't found a business case yet where we can't take 20% of the cost out. And the guy goes, really? Why don't we have it? I said look, if anyone's got any problem with it, I'll just split the profits with you. No, no, no, I'll order from you. So, that's the kind of environment we're in. If you want to talk cost, we can take it out. If you want to talk experience, we are the workflow behind it. If you want to talk executional excellence in a virtual world, this is the platform that cuts across all the systems of record, and enables all of the mobile web and conversational experiences to help the employees do their job or inspire the customers to be happy and loyal. So, I really think, it's relevancy, it's quick return on investment and it's making things better for everybody. And I really truly believe, our purpose is helping people and really making work, work better for people is truly resonating at this critical time in the world's history. Raimo, I'll start this off. As you'll remember from 2008, the world was feeling very good in September of 2008 about things until the crisis hit on the financial level. That was pretty substantial. And that was when cloud solutions that offered OpEx first CapEx and fast time to value really became the ultimate move for the enterprise. Because the power moved across the management team, the CEO basically said, do what you have to do to get the job done, do it on your budget, and CapEx slowed and cloud took over as the pervasive computing theme of the 21st century at that moment. In our case, we're already a pure play born in the cloud market leader. So, what do you do? We essentially wrote a playbook with five main plays that do what you said, take our platform and our market leading solutions and shape them in a way that gives customers what they need fast. So, digitally scaling your operations quickly and efficiently as an example combines our CSM, our ITSM Pro, and our mobile capabilities and our ITOM capabilities in one out of the box pre-packaged solution that's ready to run. If you want to reduce your technology debt, we have our SAM, Software Asset Management, the Cloud Insights and application management tool out of the box ready to run. If you want to ensure resilience for your critical business operations, we have governance risk compliance, IT operations and security operations out of the box ready to run. And we do this for the employees. We also do this when you're building any workflow. So, for the employees, you want the right digital experience from anywhere. You listen to any CEO on the business council calls, and that's what they want. You need the right digital experience for my people anywhere. So we have the Human Resource Service Delivery Pro, ready to go out of the box. It's all mobile, and it's ready to run. And, of course, I talked earlier in my remarks about asset management. You have to get the assets to the people where they're physically located. And you have to track and trace this stuff as well. Again, out of the box ready to go. And finally, on creating new workflows fast when you need them most, the App Engine is now a soaring component of the ServiceNow Platform. And I think we really kicked off a new awareness for that with our COVID-19 apps. People are like, wow! I can do my own app? And I can do it at mass scale with that kind of speed? Are you kidding? We built them in three days. I had one CEO who was fascinating, said, my goodness! I was trying to do an employee rewards program, because I want to get a great score on Glassdoor. And on ServiceNow, I had a business analyst do it in three days. So, everything we do is super fast, out of the box, ready to go and we align the whole value chain within our company to provide that to customers in a virtual world. Phil, I think -- and first of all, thank you for your question and safety and wellness to your family. Please give everybody my best, Phil. Executives today are very keen on digital transformation. You can't go to any meeting where a CEO among CEOs isn't in some way trying to digitize their company and trying to make sure that digital transformation is at the top of their to do list because they know, if they're not digitally transform and their competitors are, they're going to get wiped out. So, this is where the action is. We're in the sweet spot. And we don't have to sort of explain that. Now ServiceNow is hitting the main stage with the biggest companies in tech. And we have a very prized position, because the problem with systems of record and the technologies of the past is they do one thing well in a specific domain. It's not that that's unimportant, but those investments have been made. So, the CEOs that I talk to, want us to help make those investments work better. And that's where the platform of platforms comes in. Because we're so well positioned to take all the investments they've already made and enable them to do what they want done, which is to create workflows and inspire their people and provide outstanding service to their customers. And Phil, one of the big learnings in CRM as an example, the engagement layer has been well-penetrated. We all understand SFA, we all understand marketing, we all understand upsell, cross-sell engagement. But what hasn't been done so well is mid-office operations, how does a healthcare provider take care of 50 million claims and make sure things are done well for each and every constituent, or it could be making sure on field service level for example, deep analytics and machine learning is applied to understand how things can be corrected remotely. But, when you do have to manage an incident, it's done with the right person, the right tool set, the right training with the right preparation. So, when they do activate a resolution process, the productivity curve goes way up the customer satisfaction, loyalty effect hits. Now, you've also seen virtual agent on the platform where we can handle 50 million plus consumers at any one given time on the internet. So, it's really evolved, and ServiceNow is leading in digital transformation. And workflow is hitting mainstream awareness, which is a new curve for CEOs, and they like it. Yes. Maybe what I could do is just start off and then I'll let Gina pick it up. So, here's the deal. We have the platform of platforms. You know, we are doing fantastic in ITSM, there's no question about all the solutions in that portfolio. Employee is taking off like a rocket and continues to grow. Incidentally, we're very supportive of the systems of record out there. And that's also helpful to the customer. Because we hide all the complexity and make the user experience great. On CSM, as I mentioned to you, we can handle the engagement layer, the mid-office, or the field service layer, like no one in the market. But, if there's someone already entrenched in a certain account, we have no quarrel with that. We just make everything that they do work better. And then, there's of course the App Engine. What I see as our priority is to make sure we align the value chain by industry and persona in every geography, and we go-to-market with tremendous consistency and meticulous attention to detail in the presale sale, post-sale customer support, service and ecosystem. And that motion is completely aligned. And now, I think the virtual environment is the best way to do it at mass scale, quite frankly. I think, we all learned that in this crisis. Now, in the past, we would invent a new product or a new line, and then have to have a specialist sales force to support. I think more and more, we're going to be able to do that with our core sales professionals, because we're finding a new level of expertise in pre shaping these things, in training on these things, and aligning the value chain. So, over time, I think we'll get more done with less, as opposed to every time we want more, we have to add more. And that's the mentality we're putting into this. That's why we're only hiring 10s maybe 9s that have high potential. Gina?"

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We had a strong Q1, continuing the momentum coming out of 2019. We exceeded the high end of our guidance for subscription revenues and subscription billings and we delivered another strong quarter of operating profit and free cash flow. Q1 subscription revenues were $995 million, representing 36% year-over-year constant currency growth. Q1 subscription billings were $1.055 billion, representing 32% year-over-year adjusted growth. Remaining performance obligations, RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $6.6 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. And current RPO was approximately $3.3 billion, representing 33% year-over-year constant currency growth. Our renewal rate remained best-in-class at 97%. The strong top-line performance during this quarter is driven by continued expansion of our existing customers. We also continued to see strength in adding new customers. We closed three new customers that are paying greater than $1 million in ACV. Our cohort of customers paying us more than $1 million annually continues to grow significantly, up 30% year-over-year. We now have 933 customers paying us more than $1 million in ACV. We saw strong profitability in Q1 with operating margin at 24%, driven by our strong revenue performance, and less travel expenses due to the current work-from-home environment. Our free cash flow margin was 39%, benefiting from a seasonally high amount of collections from our strong Q4 billings. Our first quarter results demonstrate our position as a trusted innovator and partner to help our customers digitally transform. Before I move to guidance, I want to briefly discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Many of our customers are now operating in some very challenging circumstances. In response, companies, especially those in highly effective industries such as transportation, hospitality, retail [Technical Difficulty] may reevaluate how they're spending their dollars. CIO surveys and our own conversations with customers suggest though that software spending will prove to be more durable. We've seen companies place a greater emphasis on return on investment and time to value. We remain well-positioned to weather the short-term challenges. And Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers' operations. We have a strong customer base across almost every industry. And over 80% of our business is serving large enterprises globally. As a result, we expect to sustain our high renewal rate. In fact, we saw many of our customers in the highly affected industries, renew their contract and expand their uses of the Now Platform in the quarter with a large portion of this occurring in March. As Bill mentioned, we entered Q2 with the fast start playbook. And I've been thoroughly impressed with how quickly we pivoted our go-to-market motion in this work-from-home environment. We've seen early success as our pipeline continues to grow and we have been successful in closing business with both new and existing customers in the first few weeks of April. With that said, the challenges our customers are facing, particularly in Q2, have been taken into account in our assumptions. While our customers value the Now Platform and we know they are prioritizing their investment in it, customers may delay new transformation initiatives until we have greater visibility into the future operations of their business. Given the current operating environment, we expect some variability. However, we believe this will be most acutely felt by our customer base in the highly affected industries we previously discussed, which represent approximately 20% of our business. The other 80% are industries that are less affected. We are very committed to helping our customers manage through this difficult time. When required, we've taken measures to provide our customers with greater flexibility and manage through the challenges. As Bill said, we are engaging our customers like never before. We have done a rigorous analysis to understand both the risks and opportunities ahead of us. Because of the potential short-term impacts to our business, we have made the following adjustments to our guidance methodology. First, our guidance assumes that the most significant headwinds will occur in Q2 and Q3. We're also assuming these headwinds will ease and the economy will open more broadly by the end of the year. Second, we've increased the guidance range for subscription billings. This accounts for the increased uncertainty of new business, timing of renewals, and billing terms, particularly with customers in the highly affected industries.  While our guidance is based on the current assumptions about the macro environment, we are confident in our updated guidance and believe that by making these adjustments, we are appropriately factoring the risks created by COVID-19. As a reminder, we have good visibility into our subscription billings. On average, 50% is driven by backlog, more than 25% by renewals, and the remaining portion comes from net new ACV. Subscription revenue is even more predictable. Approximately 80% of the revenue that will be recognized for the remainder of 2020 is already contracted and included in our backlog. Now, let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2020, which reflects the impact of COVID-19 and the FX headwinds, as a result of declines in the British pound of 5%, the Euro of 1% and Australian dollar of 12% versus the U.S. dollar. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $995 million and $1 billion, representing 29% to 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. We expect subscription billings between $960 million and $980 million, representing 20% to 22% year-over-year adjusted growth. We expected a 23% operating margin, up 500 basis points year-over-year due to a reduction in travel expenses and the transition of Knowledge to a digital experience. For the full year 2020, we expect subscription revenues to be between $4.125 billion and $4.145 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. This guidance reflects a headwind of $52 million from foreign currency and $43 million reduction is driven by net new ACV compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance range. We expect subscription billings to be $4.60 billion and $4.66 billion, representing 23% to 25% year-over-year adjusted growth. This reflects a headwind of $52 million of foreign exchange and $123 million reduction driven by the low net new ACV compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance range. We continue to expect 2020 subscription gross margin of 86%. And we are raising our guidance for full years 2020 operating margins to 23%. This reflects savings from reduced travel, lower G&A hiring and then transition of Knowledge \u201820 to digital experience. Looking into next year, we expect our investment in these areas to return to previous levels. Importantly, as we continue to feel confident about the long-term opportunity and path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond, we will continue to invest in strategic areas, such as R&D and sales. And we expect to maintain a thoughtful pace of hiring throughout 2020. As always, we will continue to be disciplined as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. We are maintaining full year 2020 free cash flow margin guidance of 29%, reflecting an increase in operating margin offset by decreasing collections due to the expected increase in DSOs. Finally, we expect second quarter and full year 2020 diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $196 million. In summary, as we navigate through this global pandemic, a few things have become clear. Digital transformation is accelerating as companies react to unexpected disruptions of their business. We will help companies transform the way work gets done. We have a world-class management and a right product portfolio to weather the short-term challenges. We will help our customers evolve and emerge from this crisis even stronger and better positioned companies. We're in a very strong financial position exiting Q1 with $6.6 billion in RPO and a strong net cash position of $2.2 billion. We will continue to invest for long-term growth. We have never been proud of our employees on their continued focus on serving our customers, partners and communities. Our helping and humble culture is stronger than ever. We can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, we'd like to now turn over the call for questions. Thank you. Sure. Well, I'll say that we've not had any customers at this point that are unable to make payments. And so, our customer base remains very healthy. That being said, we have provided some flexibility and extended payment terms. So, a portion of our company, of our customers and those that are the ones that we're talking about in the highly effected industries. But so far, it's not [Technical Difficulty] customer base. We don't anticipate that payment deferrals or adjusted payment terms will have a meaningful impact on revenue or billing. It is why we have [Technical Difficulty] our cash flow margin guidance flat, even though we're increasing operating margin by a 100 basis points. We do feel like there'll be a little bit that will push into early \u201821, but for the most part, we feel very comfortable in our guide on free cash flow and bill. Yes. I would say that -- what I talked about slowing hiring and we talked consistently about G&A now and into the back half. We will continue to aggressively hire [Technical Difficulty]. And in fact, [Technical Difficulty] today have been [Technical Difficulty] hiring in some of those areas. And so, we have really not seen a slowdown to date in our ability to hire and attract really strong talent, which is great. I think, what we're trying to do is be really thoughtful about hiring [Technical Difficulty] continue to hire for the critical [Technical Difficulty]. I want to make sure that we are well positioned to whether this short-term storm here. I think that as IT becomes the business now, IT ops is going to be super important. But that's not the only place where we continue to see strength. And so, we did a very bottoms-up, deep dive and we did extensive scenario planning for our pipeline coverage, our conversion, our renewal rate et cetera. And so, it's really about whether or not, from our original guide, we're just thinking that some of our customers in these highly impacted industries. We believe our renewal rates will stay strong. But, as we think about net new and digital priorities, some of them may be delayed. So, that's really where we're focused on when we've brought down the guide. We absolutely believe that we'll be able to maintain our strong renewal rate. We believe that digital transformation will remain, a big priority, as Bill has talked about. So, we feel very confident right now with our current guidance. Yes. As I said earlier, the real issue that we've seen, and it hasn't been tremendous, given that only 20% of our business is with customers in the heavily impacted industries. We are not seeing any real issue with respect to sort of invoicing duration or timing. So, basically, not only, only 20% of our business in the heavily impacted industries, 80% of our business is Fortune 500. And so, we are not as exposed to smaller SMB type of business. And so, our guide does reflect some lower expectations from what we normally would see our growth on a net new ACV. The bulk of that we believe will come from companies in the more heavily impacted but some as some of these companies still May delay some of their speeding and they look for, we definitely incorporated some of that as well. No, I think that there's definitely potential upside, if the economy opens up more broadly sooner, right? We think that and we've talked about, we are very well positioned once the economy opened up, digital transformation is more imperative than ever. And our customers are really engaging with us like never before. And so, there certainly would be upside in my eyes, if the market opened up sooner. As you know, we are very, very Q4 weighted, and we're also within each quarter very last month weighted. So, as we look at the actual conversion of the pipe, we talked about pipeline being stronger than ever. Our current conversion rates are higher than normal. And so, we are very well positioned if the economy opens up more broadly to potentially be in a position to have more opportunity versus the current guidance, if that helps. And on your question with gross margins, we did see higher gross margins in the quarter of about 87%. That was really driven by a greater mix of self-hosted revenue during the quarter. We expect that our guidance for the full year, that'll be more normalized at 86%. Thanks, Bill. Yes. I would just say that you're right. We have strong growth in our sales and marketing headcount in Q1. It was the strongest sales hiring quarter ever. And we continue to invest aggressively in our long-term growth in both sales and marketing as well as R&D. I would also say that we've also seen strong productivity, which tells us we're getting good yield on a hiring investment made and affords us the ability to maintain these aggressive targets. So, we feel good, we will continue to invest here and continue to drive the long-term growth trajectory of the business."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Darren Yip, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nDarren Yip: Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2021 results and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our information discussed on this call such as guidance is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 2021 10-K that will be filed or factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We'd like to also point out that we have presented non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, and current RPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Darren, and a warm welcome to everybody joining us on today's call. ServiceNow has once again delivered results that significantly beat the high end of expectations. Here's the Q4 rundown in constant currency. Subscription revenue growth was 30%. CRPO growth was 32%. Free cash flow growth was 32%. Adjusted subscription billings growth was an exceptional 33%. Operating margin was 23%, one point over our guidance. We had a record 135 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. There has long been a Rule of 40 benchmark for highly successful software companies. These results demonstrate that ServiceNow operates beyond the Rule of 60. The company is expanding in all geographies, industries and buyer personas. Gina will share the details in a few moments, including our strong 2022 guidance. ServiceNow is uniquely positioned. We're growing like a fast-moving start-up with the profitability of a global market leader. We're on a clear growth trajectory to $15 billion plus by 2026. While our strong cash position preserves optionality, we don't depend on M&A for growth. While rising interest rates challenge others, ServiceNow's business model is built to flourish in any economic environment. We are not opportunity constrained as our customers' need for digital transformation is ever expanding. Our organic growth machine is in full flight, and our pipeline is stronger than ever. Our 99% renewal rate is one of several lead indicators for sustained performance moving forward. I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders, especially our customers for their steadfast confidence in ServiceNow. I'll give you the breakdown of our portfolio results, but first, let's discuss the market dynamics. We're in a sustained demand environment here. There are structural challenges facing every industry in every geographic region. The great resignation, supply chain disruption, inflation, to name a few. These underscore a point we have made consistently, the technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. 85% of chief executives will sustain or increase technology budgets this year, and that's according to IDC's global CEO survey. IDC has increased their forecast for digital transformation, now a $10.7 trillion opportunity through 2025. Gartner forecasts worldwide software spending will increase 12% in 2022. The data shows this is clearly more than a pandemic-induced transformation. A CEO I spoke to last week said it perfectly. \u201cI have a long list of strategic priorities. Technology isn't one of them, it runs through all of them.\u201d ServiceNow's Q4 results clearly validate the structural incline of this digital economy. As enterprises build, deploy, monitor and service technology, our IT workflow business is at the core. IT service management was in 16 of our top 20 Q4 deals, with 19 deals over $1 million. IT operations management was in 18 of our top 20, with 21 deals over $1 million. Bell Canada, Canada's largest telco company, uses IT workflows and IT operations management to enable its operations. Our platform will improve critical dimensions of both asset management and the employee experience. ServiceNow will also be supporting the United States space force to connect its space operators with warfighters across the globe. The hyper focus on hybrid work continues to propel our employee workflows business. HR service delivery was in 11 of our top 20 deals, with an exciting 24 deals over $1 million. Johnson Controls International, a smart building solutions leader, will use employee workflows to unlock productivity for its 105,000 employees. Together with ServiceNow, they are focused on creating a human-centered approach to the employee experience. NVIDIA is using employee workflows to support its employee experience transformation. With ServiceNow, NVIDIA will provide its global employees a unified service model to support its mission by providing a frictionless employee experience. CVS Health will also leverage our technology and employee workflows to help deliver a best-in-class colleague experience. As business integration is key to customer service, our customer workflows business is thriving. Customer service management was in 13 of our top 20 deals, with 10 deals over $1 million. Google Cloud plans to use our customer workflows to enhance its customer support operations. British Telecom chose ServiceNow to address the needs of its next generation of customers. The ServiceNow platform will help BT accelerate the delivery of new services from 36 weeks to three. Our new industry vertical solutions also continue to gain traction with wins at major brands, including SaaS Institute, Deutsche Telekom and Wellstar. Technology teams alone can\u2019t build the 500 million new applications IDC forecasts by 2023. Our creative workflows business is leading the citizen developer revolution. Our platform solutions were in 19 of our top 20 deals. Lockheed Martin, the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense company, is using ServiceNow to support its enterprise digital transformation. They will use our creative workflows to help automate processes globally. Petrobras, a Brazilian energy company, is using creative workflows as the foundation for its application development function. They have already built over 26 applications such as onboarding for oil platforms and managing data privacy regulations. Together, these businesses, IT, customer, employee, creator, represent a next-generation suite built on a pure-play born in the cloud architecture. Our intuitive consumer-grade experience is expanding adoption of this platform everywhere, already 70 million users strong. This has created a unique moat in terms of ServiceNow\u2019s strategic relevance in the enterprise. From a geographic perspective, we\u2019ve continued to see momentum worldwide. This includes APJ with wins at Samsung SDS in South Korea and NEC in Japan. In EMEA, we\u2019re partnering with the French Postal Service, La Poste, and leading Italian energy company, NL. As you can see, the digital opportunity is expanding dramatically for ServiceNow. Already, in 2022, we\u2019re taking significant steps on our long-term roadmap. We\u2019re introducing a state-of-the-art new solution, ServiceNow Impact. Leaders need a command center to navigate the fully connected world. ServiceNow Impact includes an intuitive consumer-grade mobile application that visualizes the value from transformation investments in real time on their device. As this experience speeds up user adoption, we anticipate a significant halo effect with broader consumption of our growing solutions portfolio. As our market opportunities expand, we are promoting strong leaders for scale. As a result of the consistent speed and unmatched quality of our innovation teams, we are expanding CJ Desai\u2019s role to Chief Operating Officer of the company. He will continue to lead products and engineering while also assuming industry and solution responsibilities for the company. Our top sales leader, Kevin Haverty, has executed at an art form level for more than 10 years at ServiceNow. Kevin will also step into a strategic role for the company, serving as a mentor for the next-generation of ServiceNow leaders. He will work directly with me on expanding our footprint in the public sector worldwide. Paul Smith will become Chief Commercial Officer, assuming our global sales responsibility. As ServiceNow\u2019s President of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Paul has established himself as a leader of consequence who can broaden the geographic reach of ServiceNow. All regions in the company have outstanding leadership in place, and I\u2019m very, very proud of the work they are doing indeed. We\u2019re also recruiting outstanding new leaders to the company. Karen Pavlin has joined ServiceNow to become Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Karen joins from our great partner, Accenture, where she led this function. She will help us embed diverse strategies directly into our business strategy because inclusive companies outperform all the others. While our leadership team continues to strengthen, our inspired global workforce remains ever loyal. Look at our retention rate. ServiceNow is not only recruiting great talent, we keep it. In the engineering function as an example, we see much lower attrition rates than any of our peer group benchmarks. While no company is immune from the war on talent, our unique culture puts us in a highly differentiated position. Our high rankings from Glassdoor show that our people are invested in ServiceNow\u2019s bright future. We see growth everywhere for ServiceNow. Our customers now view us as the standard platform for digital transformation. Our engineers continue to strengthen this highly innovative, scalable platform architecture. Our customer success teams have navigated the COVID challenges without missing a beat. Our partner ecosystem continues to build ServiceNow practices with even bigger commitments for long-term growth. The market forces are moving even more intensely in our direction. For the future of work, businesses need to integrate disparate systems. Leaders are more invested in ESG than ever. There are 2 common thirds here. First, ServiceNow\u2019s platform is purpose-built for each opportunity. Our new integrated ESG-in-a-box offering is a perfect example. Second, every company wants to become an exponential business. They cannot do that with linear processes. Of the 20 most valuable companies 30 years ago, zero are in the top 20 today. The question is then, which companies will be on that list 10 years from now? To be in that conversation, leaders need outcomes really fast. ServiceNow gives them the speed advantage they\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re empowering digital-first leaders to accelerate their vision. Our purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. Our ambition is to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. ServiceNow\u2019s 2021 results and strong 2022 guidance signal our unshakable confidence in that goal. Our performance should leave no doubt, we are executing on all cylinders, and we will continue to do so. The world is looking for market leaders to build a new inclusive, sustainable wave of economic value, and ServiceNow is delivering. This is why we embrace the brand, the motto and the maxim. The world works with ServiceNow. Thank you for your time. I look forward to your questions. Now over to our great CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill, and Happy New Year to everyone listening in. Q4 was a fantastic quarter, capping an already phenomenal 2021. Despite increased FX headwind, ServiceNow outperformed across all of our top line guidance metrics in Q4. Our performance over the past couple of years not only exemplifies our unwavering focus on delivering customer success, but is a testament to the innovation and flexibility that Now Platform provides to our customers. Whatever the macro challenges were, ServiceNow adapted to deliver value. ServiceNow\u2019s ability to quickly respond to the needs of enterprises when and where they require us most is why we\u2019ve become the trusted digital platform to drive transformation. It\u2019s why our renewal rates are best-in-class, creating a solid foundation from which we grow upon each year. It\u2019s why in 2021, we added more incremental subscription revenues than we reported in 2016. I want to pause there for that to sink in. In 2021, we added a whole other 2016 ServiceNow to the top line, incredible organic growth at scale, while generating over 30% free cash flow margin. Now turning to our Q4 results. Subscription revenues were $1.523 billion, growing 30% year-over-year in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $3 million when adjusting for the incremental $15 million FX headwind we saw in the quarter we beat by $18 million. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.7 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth and a nearly four point beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance. Q4 subscription billings were $2.420 billion, a $110 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. This represents 32% year-over-year growth on a reported basis and 33% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis as FX and duration were a headwind of 100 basis points. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities more than doubled its net new ACV contribution from the year ago period. Business services and health care and life sciences also had a robust Q4, with very high double-digit net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 99%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers\u2019 operations. These enterprises not only remain loyal ServiceNow customers, but our customer cohorts have continued to show solid expansion over time. As of the end of Q4, we had over 1,350 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. Our strategy of targeting the right enterprise customers that drive the best ROI and can grow with us over time is bearing fruit. In Q4, we closed 135 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up over 50% year-over-year. In addition, our Better Together story is resonating as 18 of our top 20 deals included five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 23%, one point above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. Our free cash flow margin in the quarter was 46%. For full year 2021, operating margin was 25% and free cash flow margin was 32%, representing $1.9 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $4.9 billion in cash and investments, putting us in excellent shape to continue investing in strategic initiatives to drive organic growth. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. What\u2019s more, we\u2019re achieving all of this with a focus on ESG and winning the right way. Last quarter, I announced our commitment to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, two decades earlier than our previous goal. This quarter, you heard Bill introduce Karen Pavlin, who will lead our efforts to strengthen our culture, ensuring equity and creating an even deeper sense of belonging. Diversity, equity, inclusion are business imperatives for ServiceNow. And in 2021, we outperformed all six of our representation and hiring goals across three categories: Black, Hispanic and Latinx and Women in leadership. At its core, ServiceNow\u2019s culture is one of belonging. It is core to who we are, and it will be one of the keys to our company\u2019s growth for many years to come. Moving on to guidance. Since the end of Q3, we\u2019ve seen an incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in a material FX headwind in 2022. To help provide investors better visibility into the underlying strength of the business, I\u2019ll be providing constant currency guidance. I would also note that in January, we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined that we could extend their estimated life from three to four years. As a result, we expect a reduction in depreciation expense, which will contribute approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in 2022, trending down to just 50 basis points in 2024. With that in mind, I\u2019ll turn to our 2022 outlook. Last year was a strong year, and I\u2019m excited to announce that our momentum will carry into 2022 as we do not expect any change in constant currency growth year-over-year. We expect subscription revenues between $7.02 billion and $7.04 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. That\u2019s 28% on a constant currency basis, the same growth as 2021. It\u2019s an amazing achievement when you think about the fact that the base we are growing off of is $1.3 billion higher when we started just last year. We expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We expect an operating margin of 25%. With regard to operating expenses, we have reopened many offices and are planning in-person conferences and user events this year. Our sales force has also already begun to travel again. As such, we expect certain COVID-related savings we\u2019ve seen over the past two years to stay in 2022. We expect free cash flow margins of 31%, and we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 204 million. For Q1, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We expect subscription revenues between $1.61 billion and $1.615 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth or 27.5% constant currency growth. We expect cRPO growth of 28% year-over-year or 29.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 25%, and we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a very strong Q4, and I\u2019m so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. Demand in 2022 continues to be strong. Enterprises are turning to ServiceNow to create new business models to address the new ways employees and customers want to engage. The Now Platform offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. We\u2019re well on our way to $15 billion and beyond and becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Before moving on to Q&A, Bill and I want to thank our employees around the world for a tremendous year. You are the key to ServiceNow success, and you all continue to make us, ServiceNow, strong. And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, team. Thank you taking my question and congratulations on a strong end to a really strong full year. Investors have been concerned this year about a potential pull forward in demand really setting the stage for a decelerating growth across software. Now looking at your results tonight and the guidance, I really can\u2019t find any signs of decelerating demand for ServiceNow. In fact, sales and marketing headcount in Q4 grew at its fastest rate since Q1 2020, which suggests you\u2019re continuing to lean in here. So two questions. First, Bill, my question to you is, what are you hearing from customers that gives you confidence in the sustainability of growth and to accelerate this go-to-market hiring exiting the year? And Gina, what trends are you seeing in terms of ramping these new sales and marketing hires. Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Phil, for your kind remarks and also for your question. Customers are absolutely focused on technology being the business strategy. And digital transformation is in full flight, and we will capitalize on that greatly. The reality on our numbers is we did not see any evidence of unusual demand pull forward into our business for 2021. It happened in an extremely linear and coherent fashion, which was really a thing of beauty to watch from an execution perspective. And as I look at the pipelines, they\u2019re ever increasing, and they\u2019re doing that across the platform, the employee experience, the customer experience, the creator experience. And all of this now is really making ServiceNow one of those real standard platforms for well-run companies in the 21st century. And I think that includes a very short list of others. We\u2019re one of them. And Phil, the business just couldn\u2019t be going better.\nGina Mastantuono: And then, Phil, on your question with respect to ramp rep, you\u2019re absolutely right, we did not pause at all on our headcount growth in Q4. We\u2019re entering 2022 with more ramped sales reps than we entered 2021, and we feel really good about pipeline and the demand that we see in front of us. So we are absolutely not stopping our investment in go-to-market resources. We are planning for a very strong 2022.\nPhil Winslow: Awesome. Thanks team. Congratulations again.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Phil.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well. Well done. The \u2013 can we talk a little bit about the revenue or you\u2019re achieving with one of your biggest clients you have like a record number now or people over $1 million in ACV. But the ACV number is also going up, like \u2013 Bill, can you talk a little bit about how you see this trending going forward with all the different products that you have, but also the product expansion that you\u2019re seeing there? How do you think this will evolve over time? Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Raimo, excellent question. This is really a beautiful point in the scale phase that ServiceNow is in. And you might notice the substantial promotion for CJ in addition to taking on his normal great results for development and engineering. He\u2019s now moving into the industry phase where we\u2019re going to connect the code to the actual industry-specific solutions the specialist professionals that guide our general line sales force and our customer relationships each and every day. And that\u2019s going to give us a real special bilateral communication with our customers to innovate at an even faster clip than we have in the past, if that\u2019s possible. And you see what happens in telecommunications, in financial services. You see what happens in government, health care, life sciences. All the businesses that we\u2019ve chosen to focus on from an industry perspective are really scaling and doing so very, very quickly. And here\u2019s where the big deals have only just begun. If you look at businesses today, and there\u2019s one retailer in particular that I referenced in the call like CBS, which is a great company, they have retail customers, but they\u2019re also transforming into a health and wellness company, and they understand the experience that they have to give their customers is evolving into a multi-workflow environment. So on one hand, I have to keep my associates super happy because they have complex enough jobs. I have to keep my customers happy because, in some cases, they want to come to the store. In other cases, they want the store to come to them. I\u2019m transforming my business model between all of these factors, and now I\u2019m going for health and wellness. And someday, I\u2019ll not only do that in store, but I can do that at the home. So you\u2019re seeing multi-complex workflows possible on the Now Platform coming together to form greater-sized solutions that have major business impact for our customers and the value we can create with digital transformation. So the challenge I\u2019ve got out to the company, Raimo, is the large deals will accelerate dramatically on a year-over-year basis. We are now prepared for that, and we have the best leaders in the positions in the company to deliver that, and we have an extremely inspired workforce and an extremely inspired ecosystem. So all that comes together. And as you know, I\u2019ve seen the movie before. When it all comes together, it equals big growth.\nRaimo Lenschow: Sounds very exciting. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great end to the year. Bill, maybe the first one for you. If you think about what you just said to Raimo\u2019s question about being in a great position to massively accelerate the amount of large deals, is it right to kind of think that industry clouds and the low-code platform vision, that\u2019s the big motion that you think will unlock the most value in some of these larger deals, even more \u2013 maybe even more so than HR, CSM? Or what\u2019s the right way to think about like the growth drivers of these expansion opportunities over the course of the next year? And look, it doesn\u2019t escape all of us the valuation contraction we\u2019ve seen in the public markets. Does it change or in any way influence your strategy or thought process around organic versus inorganic growth?\nBill McDermott: Yes. Alex, that\u2019s a really significant set of issues, and I\u2019ll address them head on. First of all, every great company has a great core business. Because when you have a multibillion core business, that core business has to perform, so you get the leverage on all the adjacencies. Our core business is better than ever, and it\u2019s growing really strong. In fact, I think it could be very close to the overall corporate growth rate as we look into the crystal ball. Then you add on employee experience. You have to remember, this employee experience and the future of work and where people are going to be working and how they\u2019re going to be working, especially exacerbated by a talent war out there, is really a big deal. And CEOs need to retain the people they have now. They better be recruiting and onboarding in a flawless manner because the employees today expect consumer-grade user experiences in the enterprise. And if they don\u2019t get them, they even don\u2019t come on in the first place because they know what\u2019s going on in these companies. The Internet tells them that. Or when they get there, they don\u2019t stay very long because they\u2019re not happy. So the employee experience is front and center. And then on customer service management, the reality is this is just starting because the world is really acknowledged that the customer is not going to come to you the way they used to. You\u2019re going to have to go to them, and you\u2019re going to have to explain to that customer that your brand gets it and you can give them an experience no matter where they\u2019re experience in your brand that has enormous consistency, service value, and yes, even helpful hands in terms of smart transactions through an AI platform like ServiceNow. And then you take the creative workflow. Look, 500 million applications between now and the end of 2023 is more applications that have been built in the last 40 years. So there\u2019s no choice. It\u2019s going to be low code, no code, and the ServiceNow platform is beautifully positioned. Now let me extend to your question on industry and low code. That is absolutely a very astute observation because if you take the low-code revolution and you combine it with industry, we\u2019re now solving business problems that have been out there for a long time. We featured the Celonis partnership where they could do the X-ray and the non-ServiceNow installed environments. We can activate all the changes that are necessary to augment the business process on the now action layer. And of course, here\u2019s the big thing, all those systems out there have been mass customized. But with ServiceNow, you can carry forward all your customizations with the creative workflow. You don\u2019t need a team of consultants in a truck coming over there for years and years projects and billions and billions. This is speed to market. This is low-cost rollout of big ideas and business model innovations and better service for the employee and the customer. So it all comes together. And the reason I\u2019m so excited about what we\u2019re doing with the executive team here is we\u2019re all lined up now to take everything we know how to do and scale it across the world in every geo, in every industry and every persona. And I have to thank my partners out there. I mean they\u2019re knocking down the door to get a bigger piece of the ServiceNow franchise. So it\u2019s all of those things coming together, Alex. Now on M&A, I want to be really super clear about this. We have no targets on the Board for M&A. And the reason for that it is on an organic growth basis. You see the numbers as much as I see the numbers. The cloud economics are in full flight. And we have engineers that love this company, and they love coming to work every day, whether they\u2019re working out of their home or our office, we\u2019re all open. And they come in and they create new things and they have an idea that they can take and they have a dream that they can build. When I listen to other engineers and other software companies that want to come over here tell me they spend 90% of their time integrating the past as opposed to innovating the future, it just reminds me of how thoughtful we have to be on M&A. So as Gina said, we have $5 billion in cash. That\u2019s going to continue to grow exponentially you know that. We\u2019re fueling our organic growth ambitions. We can be opportunistic. But in this guide and this current state of affairs, there is no intent to do any large-scale M&A. And if that were to change, I would be the first to tell you.\nAlex Zukin: Incredibly specific, and we all love the candor and appreciate that color. I guess maybe just a quick follow-up. First of all, congratulations to CJ. What a wonderful expansion of his abilities and opportunities. I wanted to ask about the shift on the Chief Customer Officer. What plays \u2013 Workday as an example, another company that\u2019s made a move to historically make the head of Europe the head of overall sales. I wanted to ask, what \u2013 in terms of the motion that you\u2019re seeing successful in \u2013 outside of the U.S. that can be applied to the rest of the organization, and particularly inside the U.S., what plays are successful that you think can be run or expanded that will work?\nBill McDermott: Well, first of all, I want to tip my cap to our regional presidents because they know I love \u2013 and I love all of them. We have great leadership with Mitch in APJ, great leadership with Mike in the Americas and now Ulrik coming on in EMEA. I know them all personally. I admire them deeply, and I really appreciate what they\u2019re doing for ServiceNow. And they\u2019re all playing critical roles in our future. Mike as an example has done an extraordinary job here for a very, very long period of time. And 65% of the number resides in his past. So he knows what we think of him. And I've always told our leaders that this is a significant company, and each piece of this puzzle needs to be managed with incredible care, and these are the leaders that will do that. Now Paul Smith brings a very unique style and know-how, especially around the expansion of the C-level relationships where he has proven himself in an exemplar fashion for the 18 months that he has been here. And as you know, we had a great track record before we got here. And he understands all the concepts that I put out on this call today because he's been through them and we're activating them together and we know exactly what we are doing. And the other thing is with CJ and the closeness that CJ and Kevin have had all these years, that continues. Kevin is still with me. And CJ is right with me. And Paul is right with me. So we're all putting this together, and we're going to activate it in every region and every industry and across every persona. And what I'm so inspired by is these executives. I respect them with my whole heart, and they're doing a fabulous job, and they want ServiceNow to be defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And they all want it as badly as I do, which is why I know it's going to happen.\nAlex Zukin: Thanks so much, guys and congratulations.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi, what an incredible finisher, 2021. You have more than $5 billion in revenue, and you have close to 11 plus in RPO that you are hardly within sight of your long-term goal, Bill and team. So kudos on that wonderful milestone. Bill, my question for you is, certainly, your vision of the platform revolution taking over from the database, relational database, middleware, that whole stack old revolution is a very compelling one because you can bring value to customers, pressing problems immediately, right? So that's been the long-term thesis of ServiceNow. Now a little bit more tactically, as you head into 2022, we've got no need to reiterate, but very briefly, inflation pressures, labor shortage, supply chain shortage and a need to boost productivity despite all these constraints. How do you see the Now Platform being equipped to handle these challenges, these tactical challenges in the near-term for corporations with your execution? Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Well, I really appreciate the question. Thank you so much for your kind remarks. I really do, Kash. Thanks a lot. ServiceNow has a unique ability to drive more efficiency and automate these processes and is absolutely a deflationary tool that helps alleviate the need for more hiring. Many companies think the only way to solve a problem is throw more bodies at it while we have no quarrel with increasing jobs. If there's a limited pool of digital assets, that's a problem. And that's why you need ServiceNow. So driving the productivity and efficiency out of the resources enterprises already have, helping them reduce the need for additional spend is our lead play in the playbook for the scenarios you laid out there. And one simple example, take virtual agents deflecting and automating tickets so that the IT help desk personnel can spend their time tackling more strategic issues, giving them more satisfaction with their job and creating a happier work environment. And this also reduces the need to hire more people in the first place. But then really smart CEOs are literally struggling every day now how I keep my people. And the only way to keep them is to give them a great experience. And they're going to feel you right out of the gates. If you recruited them and you can't onboard them properly, they're going to feel you if you can't train them and activate a customized training curriculum that's targeted specifically to their unique skills and attributes. And they're going to feel you real quick if they can't go to one portal to activate all of their services on their mobile device. So no matter where they are, their company's brand, their company's culture is talking to them. And then when you do need to manage these cases with people. My goodness, legal could be involved Finance could be involved. HR could be involved. COOs and CEOs could be involved. And most companies have literally thousands of cases that are in flight at any one time. Only ServiceNow, only ServiceNow can manage the multidisciplinary workflows that go across an organization in many different circular forms to close out a case properly. That's what we do, Kash. So I lean into the inflation conversation, the labor conversation with more and more activated now and straighting out supply chain dilemmas. We have one manufacturer in the auto industry that has us as the control tower for their entire supply chain now. A few years ago, nobody would even know that. We are solving ERP cases left, right and center with ServiceNow as the action platform. So I think the idea of this productivity, and I mentioned it in my discussion earlier, really manifests itself in our new impact product. We took a service, productized it in software where we can look at the entire value chain on the Now Platform, the entire value chain from the presale to the sale and the post-sale, all the activities that have taken place in the deployment in relation to the value that's being delivered in real-time with hard dollars and cents and an absolute measurement that the customer can look at on their iPhone, that the partner participates in the conversation. Incidentally, we're not using any other technology with the Now Platform and that ServiceNow can use. So now just think about the gorgeousness of that conversation where, as we deploy, we can show the business outcome. And the partner and ServiceNow and the customer are all on the same sheet of music on the Now Platform with ServiceNow Impact. Kash, it's amazing. We have 17 customers in the pilot join up on the Impact platform before we even launched it. We're now GA on it, and we're launching it with all of our employees globally tomorrow in every geography. This is going to create a renaissance of value delivery in the enterprise, the likes of which has never been seen before.\nKash Rangan: Profoundly exciting. Thank you so much, Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And let me echo the congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. I want to follow-through on Kash's interesting question and kind of turn it inward to ServiceNow. And so Bill, from your perspective, do you see any constraints in terms of your partners finding the people or your customers finding the people to be able to deploy ServiceNow? We're hearing about that from some of our checks and some of the systems integrated. It's just such a tight labor market. Are the people there to sort of deploy the solution? Or could that become something of a friction to just getting ServiceNow up and running? And to Gina, are you seeing any incremental or increased wage inflation in terms of sort of \u2013 you guys are hiring very aggressively, and I think headcount is up 29% year-on-year. So you're definitely finding the people. Is there any increase in wage inflation or anything extraordinary on that side of the equation given that tight labor market that might impact margins on a go-forward basis?\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much for the question, Keith. As I mentioned earlier, we are one of these significant partners to the global SIs. So if you look at the top five technology partners for the top 10 SIs, we're one of them. So while they may have some difficulty hiring to meet demand, we are getting preferential resource allocation, not only as a top five technology partner, but also because our swelling pipeline and our growth is so amazing that they all want more of that real estate. And where they have less interesting growth scenarios with other partners, they're actually peeling off headcount in favor of the ServiceNow practice. This is happening all the place. In addition, one of the things we have done is we took matters into our own hands and built out academies. And we're doing more for university programs to meet the demand, the ServiceNow train talent. And I'd note that we've also been working with our partners to sponsor and engage with local diversity profit and nonprofits to target diverse populations for next-gen skill development, which will help alleviate such labor shortages in the future. We have to initiate people into the digital world that perhaps aren't initiated but it\u2019s certainly more than capable. And I always go back to the root cause of why ServiceNow is so special. When Fred Luddy created this company, he created a platform that was a sensation, and it was designed to give people productivity, a tool to enable them to do things with their lives and their jobs that they could have never done without it. And I think that level of simplicity and agility in the general construct of the platform makes it so much easier for people to learn and develop and grow on it. And now they see where we're going. They know it's a growth sensation. And you know how it is, rising tide kind of lift all boats, and everybody wants to get on this one.\nGina Mastantuono: And then, Keith, on your question with respect to labor inflation rates. Enterprise software's talent has been in high demand for some time now. So competitive compensation has been on the rise, and it's not new for us. We continue to monitor it. We definitely anticipate some continued pressure in the coming quarters, but we remain very committed to our margin guidance that we've given you for 2022 and beyond.\nKeith Weiss: Upstanding. Thank you so much for the detail.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Keith.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hey, thanks very much, guys and congrats on the quarter. One for Bill and one for Gina. So Bill, I want to talk about a couple of submarkets that you have made acquisitions and specifically in RPA and observability and how you're thinking about those markets and your strategy, whether this will be really directed at existing larger ServiceNow implementations or how directly you're going to go into those types of deals. And then something for Gina.\nBill McDermott: Yes. Of course. Well, Michael, thank you very much. First of all, we are very excited about Ben, his leadership and the whole Lightstep team. As you know, they have been doing a great job winning amazing forward-thinking brands, and they have been doing a phenomenal job culturally integrating back into ServiceNow. So we are going to begin going to market with Lightstep, and that's going to be at mass scale, and that will be announced at the employee kickoff tomorrow. So that's exciting. And the work with Lightstep to not only serve the needs of IT but to observe things in a way that can be consumed across the value chain of decision-makers in an enterprise is pretty big. And then RPA, this whole process mining, RPA and AI, the platform for hyper automation is the ServiceNow platform. That's a huge point. And CJ and his great team, unbelievable team, they are making a major release in RPA, as you know, in our San Diego release. So more and more customers will benefit from the power of the ServiceNow platform, including RPA built into the San Diego release. It's an exciting release. What Amy Lokey and the team have done also on the user experience. I mean, we sort of demonstration of it with the Board. It's unbelievable. You know when you're dealing with ServiceNow because you're going to have one gorgeous user experience, and it doesn't matter what area of the platform you're looking to enable. It's all one gorgeous user experience. And I mean, I've never seen anything better. And it is the scale story all the way. And when we hit Tokyo in September, I hope to be in Tokyo with that announcement because I want to reach out to my great friends in Japan as a Japanese expression called dantotsu, and that underscores the spirit of ServiceNow to be better than the best. And that's the standard that we hold ourselves to. And the marketplace in Japan is really getting the memo on the power of ServiceNow and what we can do to liberate them into the cloud, and that\u2019s going to be an exciting part of our growth story.\nMichael Turits: Great. Thanks, Bill. And then, Gina, just some clarifications on the extension of the useful life. So you got essentially to flattish op margins but down a bit, like 70 bps on free cash flow. So just making sure that I understand it, and then obviously, you get that benefit to EBIT margins, but that flows through, and we see it on free cash flow because this is just a non-cash, and you\u2019re actually including expenses. So I want to make sure those mechanics are right. And then also, do you get in year two of this \u2013 do you get that tailwind to EBIT and accrual? Does that flip around to a headwind on EBIT margins and gross margins?\nGina Mastantuono: Great question, Michael. So you\u2019re absolutely right, the benefit that you\u2019re seeing this year hit EBIT and operating margins, but not free cash flow, right, because it\u2019s just a change in depreciation, which is a non-cash, right? So that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019re seeing the benefit in operating income, but not in free cash flow. What you are seeing is free cash flow is the increased cost that I\u2019ve been talking about as the COVID savings start to fade in 2022 as we come back in person for digital events and in-person events and travel. With respect to the longer tail of this change in depreciation, it definitely tapers off and gets smaller, right? So it\u2019s a 100 basis point benefit this year by 2024. It goes down to just 50 points, right? So \u2013 and that\u2019s only on the EBIT margins, not on free cash flow.\nMichael Turits: Okay. Thanks very much Gina and Bill.\nGina Mastantuono: Of course. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Mike. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you. Bill, Gina, my congrats as well to you and the entire team and especially the CJ and the others that are so deservedly being elevated within the organization. Bill, you personally have been serving enterprise technology customers for many years. And many of us have been students of the industry for a long time as well. And I hesitate to say this, but it feels like this time is different. This digital transformation freight train just keeps steam rolling down the tracks. And rather than ask you to tell us about the environment, which is obviously very strong for what ServiceNow delivers, I would instead ask you, if you agree with my characterization, why do you think this time might be different?\nBill McDermott: Thank you for the question. It is entirely different. It is entirely different because the technology that is available to customers today can be so transformative. And I believe strongly that the Now Platform from ServiceNow is literally the control tower, the platform for digital transformation or digital business. And the reason I feel so strongly about that is the enterprise has been so behind in consumerizing experiences for people. And now with ServiceNow, these leaders of companies can finally say, all I hear is good news. My HR leader tells me that all the clunkiness of the past goes away with ServiceNow, and my people are happy, and they\u2019re getting what they need. My Head of Revenue is telling me, wow, we could finally now do all the remote heavy thinking and diagnostics in a fully digital way, and we can bring our story to the customer and have that frictionless digital experience that\u2019s easily repeatable drives tremendous customer SAT and NPS and creates the loyalty effect. Wow, we\u2019re finally there. And then we can finally break through where companies are trying to refresh old applications. They can say, wow, now I can empower my people. They can build the new innovations. They can refresh the old but build the new innovations. And tech is the idea of liberating, not replacing people and creating more economic value and value-add. Plus every own person today doesn\u2019t want to work for just a paycheck. They want to purpose. And I think our purpose to make work better for everyone is absolutely the right way to go. And I think that the leaders of companies want that for their company. And therefore, I think the confluence of all of this on one platform with one consumer-grade user experience for all people, whether they\u2019re inside or outside the company, a platform that could take cost out and build revenue in is what this generation is waiting for. And once people are aware of ServiceNow, we win every time. So one of the moves that we\u2019ve made, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the pivot with the world works with ServiceNow, is bringing the world the brand that it deserves from ServiceNow. And I think that\u2019s going to really turn on a lot of people to say, aha, I might have been a C-level decision maker that knew my IT people were happy with ServiceNow. I just never knew why. Once I started to learn about it or asked about it, now I know that they can activate transformation in all dimensions of my company, not the least of which is be the action layer for the whole enterprise. And I keep telling people when I meet with the CEOs, like we have good systems of record. They\u2019re all very fine. But I don\u2019t use them. We only use ServiceNow to run ServiceNow. And that\u2019s why our people are so happy because everything works.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome. Thank you for the perspective, Bill.\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you, Brad. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thanks very much. Bill, congrats on the terrific results and outlook. I love hearing the enthusiasm. Could you drill down deeper for us on the relationship with Celonis? And how ServiceNow and Celonis work together to solve customers\u2019 problems?\nBill McDermott: Yes, I absolutely will. And thank you very much for your kind remarks, and we appreciate it. I want to go back a little bit in time on this one. There once was a time where these gentlemen graduated from Technical University of Munich. We call it TUM over in Germany. And I got to know Alex very well several years ago and also his co-founders, and we built a very strong friendship. And he used to laugh because he sent me a note in December telling me about his business. And within a few minutes, I\u2019d get back to him, and he never forgot that. And I still get back to him within a few minutes, and we still have a great friendship. And we know that we have delivery the past and move it into the cloud. We know we need to put it on an automation platform that can really change business. And therefore, in the non-ServiceNow environments, especially where it\u2019s an ERP environment, Celonis does a very good job in the process mining to actually understand where the breaks are and the opportunities are in the business process to drive business productivity and performance. It is on that basis that we said, look, we should team up because our customers more and more are asking us to get involved, automating back-office business operations and business processes with the Now Platform. So we are essentially taking this relationship and applying automation that truly move the needle for organizations to understand how workflows across the people, processes and systems of their companies. And we\u2019re helping map those elements in real time and building digital workflows to more efficiently automate work because the X-ray by itself doesn\u2019t really help. We have to then put it on the action platform to actually automate it to drive a result. So our engineering teams have created a seamless product experience that\u2019s going to make it easy and simple for customers to get the insight into the process across multiple, I might add, enterprise systems, and they\u2019ll use Celonis EMS platform and convert that insight into action, automation and remediation with the ServiceNow workflow platform. And when you bring together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development, and this touches on a question that came up earlier, low-code app development into a seamless product experience, customers will enable quick, continuous improvement with the flow of work. And I stress quick because \u2013 and this touches on an earlier, very smart question. These opportunities haven\u2019t been there for customers in the past, and they\u2019re only going to start learning about them now, which is why I see an even bigger hockey stick as we look into the future because we can revolutionize old installed base problems into new market opportunities in the cloud that are just sensational in terms of the business value they drive for corporations all over the world.\nPat Walravens: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you, Bill.\nBill McDermott: My pleasure. Thank you for the question, Pat.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Drew Glaeser with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDrew Glaeser: Hi. This is Drew on for Sterling. I was just wondering how the government vertical performed in the quarter and whether you could provide some more detail on that.\nBill McDermott: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. Our government business is truly a growth story at ServiceNow that is very, very special. So we look at the tailwinds in the U.S. federal market. It came through very strongly. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us. What\u2019s happening through is many of these agencies, they need or they have a mandate actually to digitally transform. One of the mandates is the President\u2019s management agenda of PMA. Their vision is the administration\u2019s guide to invest in the government\u2019s capacity to deliver better results. And it\u2019s aligning with ServiceNow\u2019s core offering. So for example, if you look at the pillars, it\u2019s all about strengthening and empowering federal workflow in the workforce. It\u2019s sharing data, sharing business processes, looking at things across boundaries. They have delivered excellent equitable and secure federal services and customer experiences. This is driving acceleration for better customer service. If you look at their pillar three, it\u2019s managing the business of government and that they want to make sure the systems work well. So this is all about business resiliency. Our cloud is extremely resilient. And they\u2019re focused also on cybersecurity. And I think you\u2019re familiar with that and the role that we could play in having a control tower for all the things going on from a security perspective. We can help other people\u2019s solutions also tie into that control tower effect to manage the nation\u2019s cybersecurity and obviously avoid recent ransomware attacks and other things. They\u2019re also focused on vaccine management. And we said a long time ago, I believe this was in March of 2020 when we said this that the old vaccine management process would be the greatest workflow challenge that government faces maybe in our lifetime. And as you know, we have the world\u2019s leading solution for that with entire countries. Of course, part of the United States, Germany, Scotland, many countries, including in Asia running on the Now Platform for vaccine management and returning to work safely and so forth. So all of this, to net it out, basically says that at the federal, the state, the local, the university and all public entities combined are focused on transforming digitally. They have to take these paper-based slow dangerous processes and put them in order. And the only way to do that is work home, digitize them and then execute the mission of government serving the people. And that\u2019s why the public sector now represents double digits of the Now business, about 10% of our business. And look, with the problems the government has in digitizing things, this should be one of the more sensational industry stories for us for a long, long time, which is one of the reasons why the great Kevin Haverty and I will be working very, very closely on the public sector initiative globally in his new capacity.\nDrew Glaeser: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Drew.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Drew.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Darren, and a warm welcome to everybody joining us on today's call. ServiceNow has once again delivered results that significantly beat the high end of expectations. Here's the Q4 rundown in constant currency. Subscription revenue growth was 30%. CRPO growth was 32%. Free cash flow growth was 32%. Adjusted subscription billings growth was an exceptional 33%. Operating margin was 23%, one point over our guidance. We had a record 135 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. There has long been a Rule of 40 benchmark for highly successful software companies. These results demonstrate that ServiceNow operates beyond the Rule of 60. The company is expanding in all geographies, industries and buyer personas. Gina will share the details in a few moments, including our strong 2022 guidance. ServiceNow is uniquely positioned. We're growing like a fast-moving start-up with the profitability of a global market leader. We're on a clear growth trajectory to $15 billion plus by 2026. While our strong cash position preserves optionality, we don't depend on M&A for growth. While rising interest rates challenge others, ServiceNow's business model is built to flourish in any economic environment. We are not opportunity constrained as our customers' need for digital transformation is ever expanding. Our organic growth machine is in full flight, and our pipeline is stronger than ever. Our 99% renewal rate is one of several lead indicators for sustained performance moving forward. I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders, especially our customers for their steadfast confidence in ServiceNow. I'll give you the breakdown of our portfolio results, but first, let's discuss the market dynamics. We're in a sustained demand environment here. There are structural challenges facing every industry in every geographic region. The great resignation, supply chain disruption, inflation, to name a few. These underscore a point we have made consistently, the technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. 85% of chief executives will sustain or increase technology budgets this year, and that's according to IDC's global CEO survey. IDC has increased their forecast for digital transformation, now a $10.7 trillion opportunity through 2025. Gartner forecasts worldwide software spending will increase 12% in 2022. The data shows this is clearly more than a pandemic-induced transformation. A CEO I spoke to last week said it perfectly. \u201cI have a long list of strategic priorities. Technology isn't one of them, it runs through all of them.\u201d ServiceNow's Q4 results clearly validate the structural incline of this digital economy. As enterprises build, deploy, monitor and service technology, our IT workflow business is at the core. IT service management was in 16 of our top 20 Q4 deals, with 19 deals over $1 million. IT operations management was in 18 of our top 20, with 21 deals over $1 million. Bell Canada, Canada's largest telco company, uses IT workflows and IT operations management to enable its operations. Our platform will improve critical dimensions of both asset management and the employee experience. ServiceNow will also be supporting the United States space force to connect its space operators with warfighters across the globe. The hyper focus on hybrid work continues to propel our employee workflows business. HR service delivery was in 11 of our top 20 deals, with an exciting 24 deals over $1 million. Johnson Controls International, a smart building solutions leader, will use employee workflows to unlock productivity for its 105,000 employees. Together with ServiceNow, they are focused on creating a human-centered approach to the employee experience. NVIDIA is using employee workflows to support its employee experience transformation. With ServiceNow, NVIDIA will provide its global employees a unified service model to support its mission by providing a frictionless employee experience. CVS Health will also leverage our technology and employee workflows to help deliver a best-in-class colleague experience. As business integration is key to customer service, our customer workflows business is thriving. Customer service management was in 13 of our top 20 deals, with 10 deals over $1 million. Google Cloud plans to use our customer workflows to enhance its customer support operations. British Telecom chose ServiceNow to address the needs of its next generation of customers. The ServiceNow platform will help BT accelerate the delivery of new services from 36 weeks to three. Our new industry vertical solutions also continue to gain traction with wins at major brands, including SaaS Institute, Deutsche Telekom and Wellstar. Technology teams alone can't build the 500 million new applications IDC forecasts by 2023. Our creative workflows business is leading the citizen developer revolution. Our platform solutions were in 19 of our top 20 deals. Lockheed Martin, the world's largest aerospace and defense company, is using ServiceNow to support its enterprise digital transformation. They will use our creative workflows to help automate processes globally. Petrobras, a Brazilian energy company, is using creative workflows as the foundation for its application development function. They have already built over 26 applications such as onboarding for oil platforms and managing data privacy regulations. Together, these businesses, IT, customer, employee, creator, represent a next-generation suite built on a pure-play born in the cloud architecture. Our intuitive consumer-grade experience is expanding adoption of this platform everywhere, already 70 million users strong. This has created a unique moat in terms of ServiceNow's strategic relevance in the enterprise. From a geographic perspective, we've continued to see momentum worldwide. This includes APJ with wins at Samsung SDS in South Korea and NEC in Japan. In EMEA, we're partnering with the French Postal Service, La Poste, and leading Italian energy company, NL. As you can see, the digital opportunity is expanding dramatically for ServiceNow. Already, in 2022, we're taking significant steps on our long-term roadmap. We're introducing a state-of-the-art new solution, ServiceNow Impact. Leaders need a command center to navigate the fully connected world. ServiceNow Impact includes an intuitive consumer-grade mobile application that visualizes the value from transformation investments in real time on their device. As this experience speeds up user adoption, we anticipate a significant halo effect with broader consumption of our growing solutions portfolio. As our market opportunities expand, we are promoting strong leaders for scale. As a result of the consistent speed and unmatched quality of our innovation teams, we are expanding CJ Desai's role to Chief Operating Officer of the company. He will continue to lead products and engineering while also assuming industry and solution responsibilities for the company. Our top sales leader, Kevin Haverty, has executed at an art form level for more than 10 years at ServiceNow. Kevin will also step into a strategic role for the company, serving as a mentor for the next-generation of ServiceNow leaders. He will work directly with me on expanding our footprint in the public sector worldwide. Paul Smith will become Chief Commercial Officer, assuming our global sales responsibility. As ServiceNow's President of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Paul has established himself as a leader of consequence who can broaden the geographic reach of ServiceNow. All regions in the company have outstanding leadership in place, and I'm very, very proud of the work they are doing indeed. We're also recruiting outstanding new leaders to the company. Karen Pavlin has joined ServiceNow to become Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Karen joins from our great partner, Accenture, where she led this function. She will help us embed diverse strategies directly into our business strategy because inclusive companies outperform all the others. While our leadership team continues to strengthen, our inspired global workforce remains ever loyal. Look at our retention rate. ServiceNow is not only recruiting great talent, we keep it. In the engineering function as an example, we see much lower attrition rates than any of our peer group benchmarks. While no company is immune from the war on talent, our unique culture puts us in a highly differentiated position. Our high rankings from Glassdoor show that our people are invested in ServiceNow's bright future. We see growth everywhere for ServiceNow. Our customers now view us as the standard platform for digital transformation. Our engineers continue to strengthen this highly innovative, scalable platform architecture. Our customer success teams have navigated the COVID challenges without missing a beat. Our partner ecosystem continues to build ServiceNow practices with even bigger commitments for long-term growth. The market forces are moving even more intensely in our direction. For the future of work, businesses need to integrate disparate systems. Leaders are more invested in ESG than ever. There are 2 common thirds here. First, ServiceNow's platform is purpose-built for each opportunity. Our new integrated ESG-in-a-box offering is a perfect example. Second, every company wants to become an exponential business. They cannot do that with linear processes. Of the 20 most valuable companies 30 years ago, zero are in the top 20 today. The question is then, which companies will be on that list 10 years from now? To be in that conversation, leaders need outcomes really fast. ServiceNow gives them the speed advantage they're looking for. We're empowering digital-first leaders to accelerate their vision. Our purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. Our ambition is to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. ServiceNow's 2021 results and strong 2022 guidance signal our unshakable confidence in that goal. Our performance should leave no doubt, we are executing on all cylinders, and we will continue to do so. The world is looking for market leaders to build a new inclusive, sustainable wave of economic value, and ServiceNow is delivering. This is why we embrace the brand, the motto and the maxim. The world works with ServiceNow. Thank you for your time. I look forward to your questions. Now over to our great CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Thank you very much, Phil, for your kind remarks and also for your question. Customers are absolutely focused on technology being the business strategy. And digital transformation is in full flight, and we will capitalize on that greatly. The reality on our numbers is we did not see any evidence of unusual demand pull forward into our business for 2021. It happened in an extremely linear and coherent fashion, which was really a thing of beauty to watch from an execution perspective. And as I look at the pipelines, they're ever increasing, and they're doing that across the platform, the employee experience, the customer experience, the creator experience. And all of this now is really making ServiceNow one of those real standard platforms for well-run companies in the 21st century. And I think that includes a very short list of others. We're one of them. And Phil, the business just couldn't be going better. Thank you, Phil. Raimo, excellent question. This is really a beautiful point in the scale phase that ServiceNow is in. And you might notice the substantial promotion for CJ in addition to taking on his normal great results for development and engineering. He's now moving into the industry phase where we're going to connect the code to the actual industry-specific solutions the specialist professionals that guide our general line sales force and our customer relationships each and every day. And that's going to give us a real special bilateral communication with our customers to innovate at an even faster clip than we have in the past, if that's possible. And you see what happens in telecommunications, in financial services. You see what happens in government, health care, life sciences. All the businesses that we've chosen to focus on from an industry perspective are really scaling and doing so very, very quickly. And here's where the big deals have only just begun. If you look at businesses today, and there's one retailer in particular that I referenced in the call like CBS, which is a great company, they have retail customers, but they're also transforming into a health and wellness company, and they understand the experience that they have to give their customers is evolving into a multi-workflow environment. So on one hand, I have to keep my associates super happy because they have complex enough jobs. I have to keep my customers happy because, in some cases, they want to come to the store. In other cases, they want the store to come to them. I'm transforming my business model between all of these factors, and now I'm going for health and wellness. And someday, I'll not only do that in store, but I can do that at the home. So you're seeing multi-complex workflows possible on the Now Platform coming together to form greater-sized solutions that have major business impact for our customers and the value we can create with digital transformation. So the challenge I've got out to the company, Raimo, is the large deals will accelerate dramatically on a year-over-year basis. We are now prepared for that, and we have the best leaders in the positions in the company to deliver that, and we have an extremely inspired workforce and an extremely inspired ecosystem. So all that comes together. And as you know, I've seen the movie before. When it all comes together, it equals big growth. Thank you. Yes. Alex, that's a really significant set of issues, and I'll address them head on. First of all, every great company has a great core business. Because when you have a multibillion core business, that core business has to perform, so you get the leverage on all the adjacencies. Our core business is better than ever, and it's growing really strong. In fact, I think it could be very close to the overall corporate growth rate as we look into the crystal ball. Then you add on employee experience. You have to remember, this employee experience and the future of work and where people are going to be working and how they're going to be working, especially exacerbated by a talent war out there, is really a big deal. And CEOs need to retain the people they have now. They better be recruiting and onboarding in a flawless manner because the employees today expect consumer-grade user experiences in the enterprise. And if they don't get them, they even don't come on in the first place because they know what's going on in these companies. The Internet tells them that. Or when they get there, they don't stay very long because they're not happy. So the employee experience is front and center. And then on customer service management, the reality is this is just starting because the world is really acknowledged that the customer is not going to come to you the way they used to. You're going to have to go to them, and you're going to have to explain to that customer that your brand gets it and you can give them an experience no matter where they're experience in your brand that has enormous consistency, service value, and yes, even helpful hands in terms of smart transactions through an AI platform like ServiceNow. And then you take the creative workflow. Look, 500 million applications between now and the end of 2023 is more applications that have been built in the last 40 years. So there's no choice. It's going to be low code, no code, and the ServiceNow platform is beautifully positioned. Now let me extend to your question on industry and low code. That is absolutely a very astute observation because if you take the low-code revolution and you combine it with industry, we're now solving business problems that have been out there for a long time. We featured the Celonis partnership where they could do the X-ray and the non-ServiceNow installed environments. We can activate all the changes that are necessary to augment the business process on the now action layer. And of course, here's the big thing, all those systems out there have been mass customized. But with ServiceNow, you can carry forward all your customizations with the creative workflow. You don't need a team of consultants in a truck coming over there for years and years projects and billions and billions. This is speed to market. This is low-cost rollout of big ideas and business model innovations and better service for the employee and the customer. So it all comes together. And the reason I'm so excited about what we're doing with the executive team here is we're all lined up now to take everything we know how to do and scale it across the world in every geo, in every industry and every persona. And I have to thank my partners out there. I mean they're knocking down the door to get a bigger piece of the ServiceNow franchise. So it's all of those things coming together, Alex. Now on M&A, I want to be really super clear about this. We have no targets on the Board for M&A. And the reason for that it is on an organic growth basis. You see the numbers as much as I see the numbers. The cloud economics are in full flight. And we have engineers that love this company, and they love coming to work every day, whether they're working out of their home or our office, we're all open. And they come in and they create new things and they have an idea that they can take and they have a dream that they can build. When I listen to other engineers and other software companies that want to come over here tell me they spend 90% of their time integrating the past as opposed to innovating the future, it just reminds me of how thoughtful we have to be on M&A. So as Gina said, we have $5 billion in cash. That's going to continue to grow exponentially you know that. We're fueling our organic growth ambitions. We can be opportunistic. But in this guide and this current state of affairs, there is no intent to do any large-scale M&A. And if that were to change, I would be the first to tell you. Well, first of all, I want to tip my cap to our regional presidents because they know I love \u2013 and I love all of them. We have great leadership with Mitch in APJ, great leadership with Mike in the Americas and now Ulrik coming on in EMEA. I know them all personally. I admire them deeply, and I really appreciate what they're doing for ServiceNow. And they're all playing critical roles in our future. Mike as an example has done an extraordinary job here for a very, very long period of time. And 65% of the number resides in his past. So he knows what we think of him. And I've always told our leaders that this is a significant company, and each piece of this puzzle needs to be managed with incredible care, and these are the leaders that will do that. Now Paul Smith brings a very unique style and know-how, especially around the expansion of the C-level relationships where he has proven himself in an exemplar fashion for the 18 months that he has been here. And as you know, we had a great track record before we got here. And he understands all the concepts that I put out on this call today because he's been through them and we're activating them together and we know exactly what we are doing. And the other thing is with CJ and the closeness that CJ and Kevin have had all these years, that continues. Kevin is still with me. And CJ is right with me. And Paul is right with me. So we're all putting this together, and we're going to activate it in every region and every industry and across every persona. And what I'm so inspired by is these executives. I respect them with my whole heart, and they're doing a fabulous job, and they want ServiceNow to be defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And they all want it as badly as I do, which is why I know it's going to happen. Thank you very much. Well, I really appreciate the question. Thank you so much for your kind remarks. I really do, Kash. Thanks a lot. ServiceNow has a unique ability to drive more efficiency and automate these processes and is absolutely a deflationary tool that helps alleviate the need for more hiring. Many companies think the only way to solve a problem is throw more bodies at it while we have no quarrel with increasing jobs. If there's a limited pool of digital assets, that's a problem. And that's why you need ServiceNow. So driving the productivity and efficiency out of the resources enterprises already have, helping them reduce the need for additional spend is our lead play in the playbook for the scenarios you laid out there. And one simple example, take virtual agents deflecting and automating tickets so that the IT help desk personnel can spend their time tackling more strategic issues, giving them more satisfaction with their job and creating a happier work environment. And this also reduces the need to hire more people in the first place. But then really smart CEOs are literally struggling every day now how I keep my people. And the only way to keep them is to give them a great experience. And they're going to feel you right out of the gates. If you recruited them and you can't onboard them properly, they're going to feel you if you can't train them and activate a customized training curriculum that's targeted specifically to their unique skills and attributes. And they're going to feel you real quick if they can't go to one portal to activate all of their services on their mobile device. So no matter where they are, their company's brand, their company's culture is talking to them. And then when you do need to manage these cases with people. My goodness, legal could be involved Finance could be involved. HR could be involved. COOs and CEOs could be involved. And most companies have literally thousands of cases that are in flight at any one time. Only ServiceNow, only ServiceNow can manage the multidisciplinary workflows that go across an organization in many different circular forms to close out a case properly. That's what we do, Kash. So I lean into the inflation conversation, the labor conversation with more and more activated now and straighting out supply chain dilemmas. We have one manufacturer in the auto industry that has us as the control tower for their entire supply chain now. A few years ago, nobody would even know that. We are solving ERP cases left, right and center with ServiceNow as the action platform. So I think the idea of this productivity, and I mentioned it in my discussion earlier, really manifests itself in our new impact product. We took a service, productized it in software where we can look at the entire value chain on the Now Platform, the entire value chain from the presale to the sale and the post-sale, all the activities that have taken place in the deployment in relation to the value that's being delivered in real-time with hard dollars and cents and an absolute measurement that the customer can look at on their iPhone, that the partner participates in the conversation. Incidentally, we're not using any other technology with the Now Platform and that ServiceNow can use. So now just think about the gorgeousness of that conversation where, as we deploy, we can show the business outcome. And the partner and ServiceNow and the customer are all on the same sheet of music on the Now Platform with ServiceNow Impact. Kash, it's amazing. We have 17 customers in the pilot join up on the Impact platform before we even launched it. We're now GA on it, and we're launching it with all of our employees globally tomorrow in every geography. This is going to create a renaissance of value delivery in the enterprise, the likes of which has never been seen before. Thank you, Kash. Well, thank you very much for the question, Keith. As I mentioned earlier, we are one of these significant partners to the global SIs. So if you look at the top five technology partners for the top 10 SIs, we're one of them. So while they may have some difficulty hiring to meet demand, we are getting preferential resource allocation, not only as a top five technology partner, but also because our swelling pipeline and our growth is so amazing that they all want more of that real estate. And where they have less interesting growth scenarios with other partners, they're actually peeling off headcount in favor of the ServiceNow practice. This is happening all the place. In addition, one of the things we have done is we took matters into our own hands and built out academies. And we're doing more for university programs to meet the demand, the ServiceNow train talent. And I'd note that we've also been working with our partners to sponsor and engage with local diversity profit and nonprofits to target diverse populations for next-gen skill development, which will help alleviate such labor shortages in the future. We have to initiate people into the digital world that perhaps aren't initiated but it's certainly more than capable. And I always go back to the root cause of why ServiceNow is so special. When Fred Luddy created this company, he created a platform that was a sensation, and it was designed to give people productivity, a tool to enable them to do things with their lives and their jobs that they could have never done without it. And I think that level of simplicity and agility in the general construct of the platform makes it so much easier for people to learn and develop and grow on it. And now they see where we're going. They know it's a growth sensation. And you know how it is, rising tide kind of lift all boats, and everybody wants to get on this one. Thank you, Keith. Yes. Of course. Well, Michael, thank you very much. First of all, we are very excited about Ben, his leadership and the whole Lightstep team. As you know, they have been doing a great job winning amazing forward-thinking brands, and they have been doing a phenomenal job culturally integrating back into ServiceNow. So we are going to begin going to market with Lightstep, and that's going to be at mass scale, and that will be announced at the employee kickoff tomorrow. So that's exciting. And the work with Lightstep to not only serve the needs of IT but to observe things in a way that can be consumed across the value chain of decision-makers in an enterprise is pretty big. And then RPA, this whole process mining, RPA and AI, the platform for hyper automation is the ServiceNow platform. That's a huge point. And CJ and his great team, unbelievable team, they are making a major release in RPA, as you know, in our San Diego release. So more and more customers will benefit from the power of the ServiceNow platform, including RPA built into the San Diego release. It's an exciting release. What Amy Lokey and the team have done also on the user experience. I mean, we sort of demonstration of it with the Board. It's unbelievable. You know when you're dealing with ServiceNow because you're going to have one gorgeous user experience, and it doesn't matter what area of the platform you're looking to enable. It's all one gorgeous user experience. And I mean, I've never seen anything better. And it is the scale story all the way. And when we hit Tokyo in September, I hope to be in Tokyo with that announcement because I want to reach out to my great friends in Japan as a Japanese expression called dantotsu, and that underscores the spirit of ServiceNow to be better than the best. And that's the standard that we hold ourselves to. And the marketplace in Japan is really getting the memo on the power of ServiceNow and what we can do to liberate them into the cloud, and that's going to be an exciting part of our growth story. Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Mike. Thank you. Thank you for the question. It is entirely different. It is entirely different because the technology that is available to customers today can be so transformative. And I believe strongly that the Now Platform from ServiceNow is literally the control tower, the platform for digital transformation or digital business. And the reason I feel so strongly about that is the enterprise has been so behind in consumerizing experiences for people. And now with ServiceNow, these leaders of companies can finally say, all I hear is good news. My HR leader tells me that all the clunkiness of the past goes away with ServiceNow, and my people are happy, and they're getting what they need. My Head of Revenue is telling me, wow, we could finally now do all the remote heavy thinking and diagnostics in a fully digital way, and we can bring our story to the customer and have that frictionless digital experience that's easily repeatable drives tremendous customer SAT and NPS and creates the loyalty effect. Wow, we're finally there. And then we can finally break through where companies are trying to refresh old applications. They can say, wow, now I can empower my people. They can build the new innovations. They can refresh the old but build the new innovations. And tech is the idea of liberating, not replacing people and creating more economic value and value-add. Plus every own person today doesn't want to work for just a paycheck. They want to purpose. And I think our purpose to make work better for everyone is absolutely the right way to go. And I think that the leaders of companies want that for their company. And therefore, I think the confluence of all of this on one platform with one consumer-grade user experience for all people, whether they're inside or outside the company, a platform that could take cost out and build revenue in is what this generation is waiting for. And once people are aware of ServiceNow, we win every time. So one of the moves that we've made, and I'm sure you've seen the pivot with the world works with ServiceNow, is bringing the world the brand that it deserves from ServiceNow. And I think that's going to really turn on a lot of people to say, aha, I might have been a C-level decision maker that knew my IT people were happy with ServiceNow. I just never knew why. Once I started to learn about it or asked about it, now I know that they can activate transformation in all dimensions of my company, not the least of which is be the action layer for the whole enterprise. And I keep telling people when I meet with the CEOs, like we have good systems of record. They're all very fine. But I don't use them. We only use ServiceNow to run ServiceNow. And that's why our people are so happy because everything works. Well, thank you, Brad. Thanks very much. Yes, I absolutely will. And thank you very much for your kind remarks, and we appreciate it. I want to go back a little bit in time on this one. There once was a time where these gentlemen graduated from Technical University of Munich. We call it TUM over in Germany. And I got to know Alex very well several years ago and also his co-founders, and we built a very strong friendship. And he used to laugh because he sent me a note in December telling me about his business. And within a few minutes, I'd get back to him, and he never forgot that. And I still get back to him within a few minutes, and we still have a great friendship. And we know that we have delivery the past and move it into the cloud. We know we need to put it on an automation platform that can really change business. And therefore, in the non-ServiceNow environments, especially where it's an ERP environment, Celonis does a very good job in the process mining to actually understand where the breaks are and the opportunities are in the business process to drive business productivity and performance. It is on that basis that we said, look, we should team up because our customers more and more are asking us to get involved, automating back-office business operations and business processes with the Now Platform. So we are essentially taking this relationship and applying automation that truly move the needle for organizations to understand how workflows across the people, processes and systems of their companies. And we're helping map those elements in real time and building digital workflows to more efficiently automate work because the X-ray by itself doesn't really help. We have to then put it on the action platform to actually automate it to drive a result. So our engineering teams have created a seamless product experience that's going to make it easy and simple for customers to get the insight into the process across multiple, I might add, enterprise systems, and they'll use Celonis EMS platform and convert that insight into action, automation and remediation with the ServiceNow workflow platform. And when you bring together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development, and this touches on a question that came up earlier, low-code app development into a seamless product experience, customers will enable quick, continuous improvement with the flow of work. And I stress quick because \u2013 and this touches on an earlier, very smart question. These opportunities haven't been there for customers in the past, and they're only going to start learning about them now, which is why I see an even bigger hockey stick as we look into the future because we can revolutionize old installed base problems into new market opportunities in the cloud that are just sensational in terms of the business value they drive for corporations all over the world. My pleasure. Thank you for the question, Pat. Yes, I'd be happy to. Our government business is truly a growth story at ServiceNow that is very, very special. So we look at the tailwinds in the U.S. federal market. It came through very strongly. It's a big opportunity for us. What's happening through is many of these agencies, they need or they have a mandate actually to digitally transform. One of the mandates is the President's management agenda of PMA. Their vision is the administration's guide to invest in the government's capacity to deliver better results. And it's aligning with ServiceNow's core offering. So for example, if you look at the pillars, it's all about strengthening and empowering federal workflow in the workforce. It's sharing data, sharing business processes, looking at things across boundaries. They have delivered excellent equitable and secure federal services and customer experiences. This is driving acceleration for better customer service. If you look at their pillar three, it's managing the business of government and that they want to make sure the systems work well. So this is all about business resiliency. Our cloud is extremely resilient. And they're focused also on cybersecurity. And I think you're familiar with that and the role that we could play in having a control tower for all the things going on from a security perspective. We can help other people's solutions also tie into that control tower effect to manage the nation's cybersecurity and obviously avoid recent ransomware attacks and other things. They're also focused on vaccine management. And we said a long time ago, I believe this was in March of 2020 when we said this that the old vaccine management process would be the greatest workflow challenge that government faces maybe in our lifetime. And as you know, we have the world's leading solution for that with entire countries. Of course, part of the United States, Germany, Scotland, many countries, including in Asia running on the Now Platform for vaccine management and returning to work safely and so forth. So all of this, to net it out, basically says that at the federal, the state, the local, the university and all public entities combined are focused on transforming digitally. They have to take these paper-based slow dangerous processes and put them in order. And the only way to do that is work home, digitize them and then execute the mission of government serving the people. And that's why the public sector now represents double digits of the Now business, about 10% of our business. And look, with the problems the government has in digitizing things, this should be one of the more sensational industry stories for us for a long, long time, which is one of the reasons why the great Kevin Haverty and I will be working very, very closely on the public sector initiative globally in his new capacity. Thank you very much. Appreciate it, Drew."

            "name": "Gina Mastantuono",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and Happy New Year to everyone listening in. Q4 was a fantastic quarter, capping an already phenomenal 2021. Despite increased FX headwind, ServiceNow outperformed across all of our top line guidance metrics in Q4. Our performance over the past couple of years not only exemplifies our unwavering focus on delivering customer success, but is a testament to the innovation and flexibility that Now Platform provides to our customers. Whatever the macro challenges were, ServiceNow adapted to deliver value. ServiceNow's ability to quickly respond to the needs of enterprises when and where they require us most is why we've become the trusted digital platform to drive transformation. It's why our renewal rates are best-in-class, creating a solid foundation from which we grow upon each year. It's why in 2021, we added more incremental subscription revenues than we reported in 2016. I want to pause there for that to sink in. In 2021, we added a whole other 2016 ServiceNow to the top line, incredible organic growth at scale, while generating over 30% free cash flow margin. Now turning to our Q4 results. Subscription revenues were $1.523 billion, growing 30% year-over-year in constant currency. We exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $3 million when adjusting for the incremental $15 million FX headwind we saw in the quarter we beat by $18 million. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.7 billion, representing 32% year-over-year constant currency growth and a nearly four point beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance. Q4 subscription billings were $2.420 billion, a $110 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. This represents 32% year-over-year growth on a reported basis and 33% year-over-year growth on an adjusted basis as FX and duration were a headwind of 100 basis points. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities more than doubled its net new ACV contribution from the year ago period. Business services and health care and life sciences also had a robust Q4, with very high double-digit net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 99%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. These enterprises not only remain loyal ServiceNow customers, but our customer cohorts have continued to show solid expansion over time. As of the end of Q4, we had over 1,350 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. Our strategy of targeting the right enterprise customers that drive the best ROI and can grow with us over time is bearing fruit. In Q4, we closed 135 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up over 50% year-over-year. In addition, our Better Together story is resonating as 18 of our top 20 deals included five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 23%, one point above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. Our free cash flow margin in the quarter was 46%. For full year 2021, operating margin was 25% and free cash flow margin was 32%, representing $1.9 billion of free cash flow. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $4.9 billion in cash and investments, putting us in excellent shape to continue investing in strategic initiatives to drive organic growth. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. What's more, we're achieving all of this with a focus on ESG and winning the right way. Last quarter, I announced our commitment to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, two decades earlier than our previous goal. This quarter, you heard Bill introduce Karen Pavlin, who will lead our efforts to strengthen our culture, ensuring equity and creating an even deeper sense of belonging. Diversity, equity, inclusion are business imperatives for ServiceNow. And in 2021, we outperformed all six of our representation and hiring goals across three categories: Black, Hispanic and Latinx and Women in leadership. At its core, ServiceNow's culture is one of belonging. It is core to who we are, and it will be one of the keys to our company's growth for many years to come. Moving on to guidance. Since the end of Q3, we've seen an incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in a material FX headwind in 2022. To help provide investors better visibility into the underlying strength of the business, I'll be providing constant currency guidance. I would also note that in January, we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined that we could extend their estimated life from three to four years. As a result, we expect a reduction in depreciation expense, which will contribute approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in 2022, trending down to just 50 basis points in 2024. With that in mind, I'll turn to our 2022 outlook. Last year was a strong year, and I'm excited to announce that our momentum will carry into 2022 as we do not expect any change in constant currency growth year-over-year. We expect subscription revenues between $7.02 billion and $7.04 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. That's 28% on a constant currency basis, the same growth as 2021. It's an amazing achievement when you think about the fact that the base we are growing off of is $1.3 billion higher when we started just last year. We expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We expect an operating margin of 25%. With regard to operating expenses, we have reopened many offices and are planning in-person conferences and user events this year. Our sales force has also already begun to travel again. As such, we expect certain COVID-related savings we've seen over the past two years to stay in 2022. We expect free cash flow margins of 31%, and we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 204 million. For Q1, I'm pleased to announce that we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We expect subscription revenues between $1.61 billion and $1.615 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth or 27.5% constant currency growth. We expect cRPO growth of 28% year-over-year or 29.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 25%, and we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a very strong Q4, and I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. Demand in 2022 continues to be strong. Enterprises are turning to ServiceNow to create new business models to address the new ways employees and customers want to engage. The Now Platform offers the speed, flexibility and innovation companies need. We're well on our way to $15 billion and beyond and becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Before moving on to Q&A, Bill and I want to thank our employees around the world for a tremendous year. You are the key to ServiceNow success, and you all continue to make us, ServiceNow, strong. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A. And then, Phil, on your question with respect to ramp rep, you're absolutely right, we did not pause at all on our headcount growth in Q4. We're entering 2022 with more ramped sales reps than we entered 2021, and we feel really good about pipeline and the demand that we see in front of us. So we are absolutely not stopping our investment in go-to-market resources. We are planning for a very strong 2022. Thank you, Phil. Thanks Alex. And then, Keith, on your question with respect to labor inflation rates. Enterprise software's talent has been in high demand for some time now. So competitive compensation has been on the rise, and it's not new for us. We continue to monitor it. We definitely anticipate some continued pressure in the coming quarters, but we remain very committed to our margin guidance that we've given you for 2022 and beyond. Thanks Keith. Great question, Michael. So you're absolutely right, the benefit that you're seeing this year hit EBIT and operating margins, but not free cash flow, right, because it's just a change in depreciation, which is a non-cash, right? So that's the reason why you're seeing the benefit in operating income, but not in free cash flow. What you are seeing is free cash flow is the increased cost that I've been talking about as the COVID savings start to fade in 2022 as we come back in person for digital events and in-person events and travel. With respect to the longer tail of this change in depreciation, it definitely tapers off and gets smaller, right? So it's a 100 basis point benefit this year by 2024. It goes down to just 50 points, right? So \u2013 and that's only on the EBIT margins, not on free cash flow. Of course. Thank you. Thanks, Drew."

And welcome to our Q3 earnings call. While a beat and raise headline from ServiceNow is familiar, it is no less extraordinary. Our team delivered another outstanding quarter, yet again, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31% organically. This is unprecedented in our Industry. CRPO was up 32%, subscription billings were up 28%. Operating margin was 26%. We again have raised our guidance for the full year, strengthening our clear path to 15 billion plus in revenue by 2026. I was introduced to ServiceNow CEO more than 2 years ago. We've all seen a lot since then. What we've never seen, is such consistent innovation and execution at global scale.  Thanks to our customers, employees, and partner, we're well on our way to becoming that defining enterprise software Company of the 21st Century. And we're only getting started. Before Gina gives you a complete report, let's talk about this dramatic structural incline at ServiceNow. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. IDC has consistently sized this opportunity at 7.8 trillion over a 4-year period. With its massive addressable market, ServiceNow is at the intersection of 2 generational opportunities. First, the need for new technology foundation is supercharging our close partnership with [Indiscernible]. A recent Wall Street Journal report highlighted the role of [Indiscernible] as the architects of digital business. Ongoing advances in public Cloud and machine learning, are for forging a new era of software innovation.  Technology teams want a fully integrated software cycle; planning, development, deployment, operations, and service. ServiceNow, is leading this 20th to 21st Century migration for our customers. The Now platform with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control tower for digital transformation. With second dimension fueling ServiceNow is the reordering of the enterprise application platforms for hyper automation. Leaders today recognize their technology architecture is their business architecture. Over several decades, enterprise that invested trillions is on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications. These applications satisfied the business process needs of the 20th century.  Today, new business models require a fully connected value chain. Legacy environments are not adaptive enough to enable this change. As the pioneer of modern digital workflows ServiceNow, in leading the renaissance. The Now platform connects different applications and data sources to create intuitive, mobile experiences all at a consumer grade. We don't ask businesses to bet everything on a single system or collaboration tool. We get choice, which not only unlocks value from our platform, but from other platform investments as well. ServiceNow also empowers anyone to build applications on our platform. In it's low-code development technologies report, Gartner estimates that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code, or no code technologies.  Gartner, also named ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant. These tailwinds are driving fast organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio. The number of deals greater than a million dollars was 63 up 50% year-over-year, signaling substantial adoption of our platform strategy. In Q3, IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 18 of our top 20 deals, while IT operations management, had 10 deals over a million. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is in a multi-year digital transformation effort. In Q3 they chose ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform so support the agencies mission critical operations. Demand for our entire IT portfolio is strong.  And with the launch of Light step incident response in Q3, we're unlocking a new wave of product lead growth in application monitoring and observability. Employee Workflows also had a fantastic quarter, with HR in 13 of our top 20 deals. In Q3, NTT data will leverage the Now platform to create an employee experience portal enhancing productivity for hybrid work, and managing vaccine administration for it's entire workforce. Momentum continues for customer workflows, with CSM in 12 of our top 20 deals, and 8 deals over a million. Industry Verticals Solutions are leading the way with major brands. Verizon is adopting our Telco Solution, American Century, our financial services solutions, and Sunbelt Health, our healthcare solutions.  Creator workflows which helps businesses build their own applications was exceptional in Q3, in 18 of our top 20 deals. We're partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring ServiceNow as new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to change how they serve their customers. Together, we're maximizing facility up time and delivering great experiences to distributors, dealers, and end consumers. Fujitsu will also expand it's use in the Now platform to drive its own digital transformation. we couldn't be prouder that Uber, Honeywell, Trulia, and many others all chose ServiceNow in Q3. This is a complete performance for the Company. Strong growth across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific Japan.  As we look to a strong finish in 2021 and beyond, here are a few of the many factors giving us great confidence in this business. First, while a lot of talent is raging out there, we're highly encouraged by the colleagues choosing ServiceNow in record numbers. Our new joiners together with our amazing global workforce, are building a uniquely inclusive, driven, and happy culture. We're also seeing major developments and our partner ecosystem. Just 3 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Celonis.  Celonis will deliver process mining insights, ServiceNow will build better workflows, our customers will gain from the integrated approach. We also defend our long-standing partnership with Microsoft. ServiceNow's employees center, can now be directly embedded in Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users. Together with our expanding partner community, we will reduce complexity to make work better for people. Finally, innovation without disruption is a hallmark of our best-in-class engineering tradition. When we stay without disruption, we mean invisible.  A seamless upgrade experience for our customers. In our Now platform roam release, we delivered countless new features to customers. Including, mobile app builder, an automation discovery tool, employee journey management, and new customer service play box. Every business leader in the world, is looking at the future and work. These new features give the Now platform even more capability to build that hybrid future. I'll refer to a comment made by industry analyst, Josh Passon (ph), who said, our own platform release. This Company seems to be able to build and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen and that's why they are juggernaut. Josh, naturally, I agree.  In closing, the Company as firing on all cylinders, the quarter speaks for itself. We beat again, we raise again. The secular tailwinds are at our backs. Our customer base is expanding, just as our customer NPS is increasing. Our partner ecosystem is fired up. We accelerated our timeline to be net 0. We help businesses drive their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release. The list goes on and on. Overall, our message to the market couldn't be any clearer. Whatever systems, challenges, or opportunities you have, however fast you need to move, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow. We want to make the world work better for everyone, and we'll never lose our focus on the privilege that comes with saying, \"The world works with ServiceNow. \" I look forward to your questions. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you Bill. Q3 was another fantastic quarter with continued out-performance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics. Demand was strong globally across all 3 of our GEOS. The consistency of our results quarter-after-quarter exemplifies the strength of our product portfolio, and it seems focused on building deep customer relationships. Q3, subscription revenues of $1.43 billion, $22 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of 100 basis points tailwind from FX. RPO ended the quarter at approximately 9.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth.  Current RPO was approximately 5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth and a 2 point beat versus our guidance. Currency did not have an impact on year-over-year growth. Q3 subscription billings of 1.38 billion representing 28% year-over-year growth and a $55 million beat versus the high-end of our guidance. Assets and duration were 150 basis points tailwind year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across the industries we serve with transportation and logistics and business services, seeing particularly robust net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a healthy 98% in Q3, a testament to the value ServiceNow delivers to our customers.  We view our relationship with customers as long-term partnerships, and we continually innovate to provide new solutions to address their evolving business needs. The land in expand motion has manifested into a base of 1,266 customers paying us over 1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. As the breadth of our portfolio and the addressable opportunities end have expanded, so too have our deal sizes. Because 63 deals greater than 1 million net new ACV in the quarter up over 50% year-over-year. And in Q3, all of our top 20 deals included 4 or more products. Turning to profitability.  Operating margin was 26%, 3 points above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. We also saw savings from the delay and return to work and lower travel. Our free cash flow margin is 15%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty, and significant applies to be gained. By delivering more intelligent automation that provides even better experiences, we are well positioned as the workflow standard on our journey to becoming a $15 billion plus revenue Company.  Turning to guidance, we're raising our guidance for the full year. We're raising our subscription revenues outlook by 32 million at the midpoint to a range of 5.565 billion to 5.57 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth, including 200 basis points of FX tailwind. We're raising our subscription billings outlook by 61 million at the midpoint to a range of 6.379 billion to 6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net tailwind from [Indiscernible] and duration of 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85%, and we're raising our full-year 2021 operating margins from 24.5% to 25%.  This reflects the increase in our top-line growth and savings from the delay of [Indiscernible] work and lower travel. We're also raising our full-year 2021 free cash flow margin by 50 basis points from 31% to 31.5%. And we expect diluted weighted average upsetting shares of 202 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between 1.515 billion and 1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a negligible impact from FX. We expect the RPO growth of 27% year-over-year. This includes the 150 basis points FX headwind due to the sharp movements recently in the euro and pound. On a constant currency basis, we expect the RPO growth to be 28.5%.  We expect the system billing between 2.305 billion and 2.301 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in Q4 of 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes the net headwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. We expect an operating margin on 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spend in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022.  And we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, the pace of digital investment is accelerating and ServiceNow is rising up to seize the opportunities before us. The team has never been more engaged and focused on serving the enormous needs of our customers. And as ServiceNow becomes the defining enterprise software Company of the 21st century, we are also remaining steadfast in our goal to create positive impact in the world.  I'm happy to announce that in September we committed to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, 2 decades earlier than our previous goal. We've never been prouder of our employees and they're continued focus on serving our customers, partners, and community. As they make not only work, work better, but the world work better too. Our hungry and humble culture is stronger than ever, we can't thank our employees enough enough for their hard work and dedication. And with that, I'll look it up for Q&A.\nOperator: If you'd like to ask a question at this time, please press [Operator instructions]. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Management asks that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Your first question will come from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much, Bill and Gina. Outstanding quarter. Bill, I wanted to just get your high-level thoughts coming as we did after a spectacular quarter and listening to campus [Indiscernible] on this call yesterday, we talked about tech as a percentage of global GDP going from 5 to 10%. I think I've said that before, which leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that tech density -- enterprise tech density is just going higher. It's not the world from 10 years back. We are a couple of ERP terms and that's it. Now it's thousands and thousands of SaaS applications in the [Indiscernible].  Where does that leads ServiceNow in terms of business prospects for spreading horizontally, vertically with your ITOM, ITSM, and the Workflow Engine, obviously, given that enterprise take density is just set to go from higher to even higher levels. And once again, Gina, when we look at this, this year has been fascinating. Net new businesses been accelerating for a few quarters. I know that you're not giving us thoughts on '22 yet, but how do you feel qualitatively stepping into 2022 with the renewal base that looks very solid, your net new business trends are getting better? Curious to get your thoughts. Thank you so much.\nBill Mc Dermott: Well, Kash. Thank you very much for your kind remarks. You called the progress of our share price early on in the year, congratulations to you, you had it nailed. A couple of things, Kash. If you look at the geographies around the world, every single geography not only beat expectations, but they actually beat our internal plan handily. So every geography is expanding with ServiceNow at a record [Indiscernible]. If you look at our expansion in industry, we saw growth across all of our industry categories this quarter, it's amazing. Industries that were COVID impacted like transportation, logistics, business services, telecom, media, technology, financial services, government education, every single one of them was unbelievable success story this quarter.  And we have expanded dramatically in manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, telecommunications, and banking. just to name a few. So think GEO, think industry, also think persona. This employee workflow business of ours is unstoppable because the employee experience is unstoppable, especially in a labor market that requires talent. And as you pointed out [Indiscernible] remarks are absolutely right. The GDP growth in tech is inescapable because it's the only way out, in a hybrid world to manage a competitive Company especially when you're competing for talent and you have to give them a great experience.  Example, on-boarding experience, connecting all of their training tools, really making them a part of the culture when they might not even be in your buildings. Customer workflows, we announced a partnership with Twilio. Dealing with what's app and various messaging techniques, because all the old school ways are going away quickly. So with our CSM, our employee workflows, the experiences we're giving to people, is just unreal. And don't forget the creator workflows. 500 million net new applications will be developed in the next 2 plus years. And that will be developed for companies, by companies in their own technology departments and there's not enough engineers to do that in the world.  So the Now Platform is a growth sensation. All of these forces are coming together at once. And that is why I could not be more confident in the bullish stance on ServiceNow, not just in the short term, we run our business with clear messaging, clear facts. We could see the pipeline way into 2022 and some cases beyond. It is a fantastic situation right now, Kash. And Kash on your question with respect to the '22. Obviously, it's a bit early to talk guidance, but you are 100% correct. Our renewal base is very strong. We've seen very strong net new ACV acceleration throughout the year, as I've been talking about. And so we feel really bullish on the opportunities ahead of us in '22. The one thing that I would note is that FX has turned against us a little bit as we head into '22. And so I'm sure you would have all seen especially with respect to the euro, the dollar increasing. And so we have a bit of a headwind on FX as we look into '22. But feel really good about the underlying health of the business, our renewal of our net new ACV. And so we're poised to have a strong 2022. Very gratifying, brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you, [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Well, thank you. Hi, Gina. 3 months ago on the 2Q call, you prepped us in terms of the back-half seasonality into thinking 3Q would be a little bit sub-seasonal, 4Q stronger as you were seeing that deal skew. In fact, you put up numbers where the 3Q actual and the 4Q billings guide of 26% are roughly even. So I'm just curious whether since you made that call, that seasonality 3Q, 4Q has changed and whether it played out in the way that you expected. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. Listen, I think we are really proud of the Q3 beat that we saw. Bill talked about all GEOS operating on all cylinders. And that's across the geographies, across all of the product portfolios. And so we were really pleased with the beat that we saw in Q3. We absolutely continue to see more business back-half-weighted to Q4. That is going to be a trend that we continue to see.  When you look at our Q4 results and our Q4 guide, you have to remember last year Q4. We had that 80 million of early payment that were brought forward, that really drove a higher growth number in Q4. And if you normalize that -- it's why I called out pretty transparently in the script. If you normalized for that, we're seeing 32% growth in Q4 billing. And so a really strong guide given our scale and our base.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. That's clear. Thanks, Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Bill, could you just talk a little bit about the Federal business this quarter in terms of the opportunities for that. Going into the fourth quarter, maybe next year. And then Gina, just one follow-up to Karl's question on the fourth-quarter guide. I realize that seasonalities gain more compounded, there's a lot of co-term activity that goes on around the fourth quarter.  I guess people are wondering why maybe the guidance wasn't upsized a little bit, relative to where it was implied going into it. So I was just kind of curious. I realize there's a lot of permutations that go under the fourth quarter just given the size of it. But was there anything else that maybe is making it be a little bit more conservative just in terms of visibility into add-on deals and things like that. Thanks.\nBill Mc Dermott: Kirk, thank you very much for your question. We had a very, very strong federal quarter. 15 deals over a million, 14 federal agencies are now paying us more than 10 million. Key strategic wins included the IRS, which I talked about already, but it's certainly not limited to that. It's pretty amazing how the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing the services digitally to the citizens, which is incredible because as you know, that's all about the user experience and it's a workflow challenge. For example, look at how difficult it was for the government to get money out to small businesses during COVID.  There also were some big opportunities with new initiatives in the administration including resiliency, our business continuity, outages, terrorism, COVID, cyber security on top of many lists. The White House actually put out an executive order on improving the nation's cyber security after recent ransom attacks. So that's all workflow related leveraging existing systems that don't talk to each other very well. You certainly not going to rip and replace them, so that's where the Now platform comes in. And then just think about vaccine management, it remains one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces.  And boosters now will likely need to be re-administered on a regular basis. This again is a workflow challenge to distribute, administer, and monitor vaccines. We're in the mix on all of that. And what we're seeing is the connection of federal, state, and cities. They're all implementing the Now platform to engage with citizens. They're using products like Customer Service Management to help digitize these workflows that can no longer be processed in person, because the offices are still closed during the pandemic.  So overall, take this as a strong, aggressive, bullish, confident reply that the public sector is embracing the Now platform as its transformational opportunity at federal, state, local, university, and all public entities that are quickly embracing us. Because our Net Promoter Score is so high and we're a mouse that's saying this is the way to go, go now.\nGina Mastantuono: And Tamar on your follow-up question with respect to Q4. And so I talked a bit about the normalized billings. So that's 32% for Q4. We actually have a 50 basis points FX headwind in Q4 of this year versus we had 150 basis points tailwind in Q3. So we really are moving in the right direction. What I would also call out is last year Q4, saw a tremendous growth, even when you normalize for those 80 million in collection.  And so we are basically at 32% growth in Q4, this year is normalized, on top of a 32% growth last year. So strong growth upon strong growth, I will say also that not only did we raise the guide for Q4 by our Q3 B, but we increased it by another 13 million in billings. We are seeing headwinds in Q4 for FX, but excluding that constant currency, constant duration growth is really strong.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes Brad Sills from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question here. I wanted to ask about the Celonis partnership. It seems interesting; natural interplay with some of the AI features in the enterprise editions. Where do you see that partnership providing the biggest boost when you look across the stack at ServiceNow?\nBill Mc Dermott: Yeah. Brad, thank you very much. The quick answer is the creator workflow platform. But what you're seeing out there is many businesses really have not maximized the value of their digital investments because they lack insight into the inefficiency of their processes. And that's what's holding back their business operations. So if you want to move the needle, organizations are going to need to understand how work is done across people, processes, and systems. So what's happening here is ServiceNow and Celonis that help customer map those elements in real-time, and then build digital workflows to more efficiently automated work.  So we're going to create a seamless product experience for customers that's going to make it easy and simple for them to get insight into their processes across multiple enterprise systems. You'll be able to use Celonis 's EMS platform, and convert that insight, the x-ray, into action, automation, and remediation on the ServiceNow workflow platform. So think about brand to get the process mining, automation machine learning, RPA, and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience that customers will be enabled to quickly and continuously improve the flow of work.  So, shorter answer is the creative workflow platform, but what's happening is Celonis gets the x-ray, especially in the non ServiceNow environments. And then we use all the power of the Now platform, including process mining in the ServiceNow environment to give them a fast automation platform to make that business process home and really drive business outcome. I think this one is going to be really exciting and I thank my good partners, Alex and Bastian and Martin. I know our engineers are very committed to each other and we were going to nail it.\nBrad Sills: That's great to hear. Thanks so much, Bill one more if I may, just on that same topic there with creator, the progress you're seeing this quarter 18 into the top 20 deals. Are there any patterns you're seeing emerge in terms of common applications that are perhaps repeatable through the SI channel or just any color on where you are seeing traction there on the application side? Thank you so much.\nBill Mc Dermott: Yeah. It's amazing. We literally had a review of this business just yesterday, and our outstanding leader just took us through it. And what you're basically saying is, the Now platform is integrated with all systems of record. So customers can build applications fast. And we really are the platform of all the other platforms. I've been seeing platform or platforms for a long time. And I want to make it clear we respect all those other platforms, all those other excellent brands. Our job is to make all of them even better by moving into the action layer or the hyper-automation layer on the Now platform.  And a trend we're seeing is, the younger generation of workers, they're not going to submit tickets. They want action. So enterprises are creating these centers of excellence, and they're letting students and developers build the solution to solve for the business challenges. I believe that hyper-automation is a key differentiator,, and because we have this 1 platform that does it all, RPA low-code process mining all on a single platform, and now with Celonis we get process mining in the non-service now environments, we bring everything together so customers can completely rethink their business model.  Example I gave in the script is Stanley Blacker their base -- Stanley Black & Decker. They're combining their new manufacturing vertical solution with the App Engine to build over 70 custom applications. This is all being done on the now low-code application platform. And our Fujitsu also is an example where they using App Engine to drive digital transformation and sustainability across the Company, moving the green line, not just the top and bottom line.\nBrad Sills: That's great to hear, Bill. Thanks so much.\nBill Mc Dermott: Thank you very much for the question. Appreciate it, Brett.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tamar Samana (ph) from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTamar Samana: Hi, good evening to exchange my questions. Congratulations on the great quarter. Bill, maybe one for you. You've talked about hiring and continuing to sustain growth. I noticed as I look at hiring in your professional services department, you've already added more people in 2021 than you did, I think, in the last 2 years combined. I'm just curious, should we see that as a leading indicator of projects that are firing up or service not taking a more active role in helping their own customers implement new deals? How should we think about that?\nBill Mc Dermott: You should think of ServiceNow as a growth Company. As a Company that is firing on all cylinders and as a Company that is attracting the best talent in the industry. And that's really a sustaining part of our success. I'll give you an example, you take somebody like Erica Volini, who joined from Deloitte, she had a fantastic career at Deloitte. And she wanted to come in and help us transform the service experience for our customers. We're collapsing the pre and post-sale conversation. Everything here is about business impact and we're rethinking the whole services model. That's why our customer satisfaction and our net promoter score, is soaring. Not just our retention, we're focused on the in-process measures.  That's why Jon Ziglar (ph) came to us after great career at Apple, Microsoft and sales force and said, he believes that the Now platform was the future of business. And what we have been able to do is, hire thousands of people, even in a pandemic. Because the Now platform enables us to create the seamless hiring on-boarding, immediately scaling people off to our culture and their training needs, and then managing them in a hybrid world in a way that gives them the experience of our culture, and the word gets out there quickly. We are literally harder to get into the Stanford statistically, even as you see thousands joining.  So we are not opportunity constrained, and that's what I've been saying the whole time. Why are we organically growing? Why are we committed to our engineering? Why are we fiercely committed to our market leadership? Because we can be, this is the plant of this generation and we're investing primarily in great engineers and go-to-market, especially quota-bearing, where we can deliver for our shareholders, our customers, and our partners. The other thing I want to underscore is we have really expanded the ecosystem. So as you even see us hiring thousands, just think the Ecosystem is hiring even more thousands on thousands, to get around this Now platform and get their piece of the action in GEOS, in industries and Personas, this is a growth story.\nTamar Samana: Not only do we see as a growth story, but one of the best growth stories.\nBill Mc Dermott: Thanks.\nTamar Samana: Gina, just a quick follow-up for you if I can squeeze it in just -- as I think about some of the new customers signed in 4Q of last year, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market. Are you seeing those customers expand at a higher rate or maybe being easier to up sell as you get -- as you lap the cohorts. Maybe they were signed up late last year as new ads, just as we get more certainty and looks to be a stronger macro-environment.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah. We're really pleased with our new logos, both from Q4 of last year and throughout 2021. We're seeing strong growth even in Q3 with 6 new customers greater than a million dollars, and they're across industries, just in Q3 alone, that's banking, retail, manufacturing, and energy, just to name a few. We are absolutely seeing our deal sizes grow. New customers, average deal size grow quarter-on-quarter, and year-on-year. And we're seeing healthy growth abroad in EMEA and APJ as well. And so we're really focused on evolving our land to the right new customer. And IC continues to be a high percentage of those new logos. And we're seeing we are actually seeing a much higher percentage also, of land occurring with CSN, App Engine and HR, and so those cohorts are growing very well. Our expansion rate is doing very well, and just really firing on all cylinders across all 3 of our geographies.\nTamar Samana: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you for taking the question. Gina, a question for you. Just trying to understand the very varying trajectories of what you're describing in terms of billings growth. It sounds like it's accelerating into Q4. And granted there's a lot of normalizations in here, I think that's right where the answer is. To get to that 32% normalized billings growth in Q4 versus the current RPO growth, which you guided to a pretty sharp deceleration. I think going for like 32% growth, that's 28.5 on a constant-currency basis. Are there any kind of factors that we should be aware of, in terms of adjustments or sort of changing contract dynamic that would cause that variance in the trajectories?\nGina Mastantuono: It's a great question and so rightfully so, you took into account the FX is impacting our CPR -- C RPO. Most of the remaining CRPO growth as I already said, is actually due to seasonality within our renewal cohort. And so our typical customer contracts as far as you know, is around 36 months on average, and we have a large cohort coming up for renewal in 2022. So this is starting to flow out of Q4 of this year. Which because of one included the future renewals until they renew with pipeline sale.  And so that deceleration is really what's driving that -- it's the seasonality of the cohort that's driving that deceleration. And once that cohort renews in 2022 and with 98% renewal rates across-the-board, we feel really good and strong about our renewal base, that will have a stabilizing impact with the RPO growth into 2022.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. That makes a ton of sense. Thanks so much.\nGina Mastantuono: Awesome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thanks so much guys and congratulations again. Bill, maybe just the first one for you around your -- I know you beat this drum quite a bit for the first 3 quarters. But I want to ask it again. As we look to 2022, your approach towards -- and thinking about organic versus inorganic growth. Obviously, the organic growth and the profile of the Company has been second to none to date. How are you thinking about the road to 15 plus as you sit here today, within that construct? And I have a quick follow-up for Gina.\nBill Mc Dermott: Alex, it's a great question. I could not be -- I could not possibly be more confident in our our ability to achieve the 15 billion plus on an organic basis by 2026, which is exactly what I said at the Investor Day. And I also underscore the fact that we recognize that our balance sheet is extremely strong and will be even stronger as we move into the future. And we continue to source, look at, consider all options that would benefit shareholder value creation without ever passing on any tech debt to customers as many others have done.  So, just know that everything is always on the table, but at this time there are no substantial acquisitions on the table, not a single one. And we could not be more confident in our organic growth. In fact, that's where we're looking at our investments and we're prioritizing them because we're certainly not opportunity constrained, Alex. The Company is in fantastic shape.\nAlex Zukin: That's awesome. And Gina, maybe one for you. We've talked a lot about growth and confidence in growth both into Q4 and even beyond, I wanted to ask you a question about margins, some of your peers have talked about models coming out of the pandemic that are more efficient learnings that maybe not every salesperson has to get on a plane and there's more productivity to be had in a remote world and construct.  While others have talked about investing more aggressively for growth and doubling down and seeing some of the tailwinds from the pandemic savings potentially revert next year. Where does ServiceNow fit in from a margin conversation standpoint as we start to think about a more normalized environment, hopefully?\nGina Mastantuono: Absolutely, it's a great question. Thank you so much, Alex. So, first of all, 100% I noticed that many of our learnings from working remotely will absolutely have lasting effect on our overall efficiency. But I've been pretty transparent throughout the year, that it does give us the ability and the agility to redeploy savings elsewhere. Like Bill just talked about organic growth. We are at an inflection point where we have no lack of opportunity and we are a first and foremost a growth Company and we will absolutely invest behind that. That being said, at our Financial Analysis Day in May, I talked about committing to 26.5% margin by 2024. We absolutely remain committed to that and on that trajectory, but I don't think that, that increase is going to be linear.  As we think about offices reopening, and travel becoming more consistent and in-person events happening more. We definitely don't believe that it's going to be a linear path to 26.5. I'm not actually in a position at this point to guide the 2022, but we are 100% committed to over that 3-year period, getting to 26.5. Because we absolutely believe that will have savings that will be able to pay from these learning and efficiencies from the pandemic and redeploy them on growth opportunities that we see absolutely in front of us today.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed the million-dollar customers were up pretty nicely year-over-year here in Q3. I was wondering kind of the drivers of that was there -- some one-offs and should we expect that type of strength in customer adds are heading into your seasonally strongest quarter.\nBill Mc Dermott: Yes, you should expect it to continue, Tyler. The reality is we've become a platform Company. I came in a couple of years ago now, and we've really seen the transformation of the Company to full-scale enterprise software companies. And we took the strength that we had in IT and we have made it really our hallmark because it's very clear now in this world, as the world is dealing with digital transformation, everybody understands that the technology architecture is the business architecture.  And that has given us enormous responsibility, but also permission to expand the perimeter into the employee experience, into Customer Service Management, including direct-to-consumer, field service management. This create a workflow business which is just an absolute sensation ties together so many of these just disjointed processes systems and silos and enterprises today, and really puts together an enterprise software market leading approach from ServiceNow, so think of us as an enterprise player on a platform that is unstoppable.\nTyler Radke: Great, and Bill, you mentioned earlier that transportation and logistics are particularly strong on net new ACV. And we're just curious on the angle of supply chain constraints that a lot of industries are facing. Are you finding that that's a catalyst for conversation around digitizing and creating more efficient workloads and just help us understand the balance of that versus potential challenges, closing deals, just given the supply chain constraints. Thanks.\nBill Mc Dermott: Yeah, actually, it's a great question, Tyler, because I know in some industries they talk about the supply chain dilemma and boat off the port with a lot of things in them. But this is actually an opportunity for us, because what's happening now is companies have to reorient their business models. They have to think about their extended supply chain. They have to rewire who their partners are actually going to be, and who they're not going to be. How they're going to source things from different places in the world that they've never even worked with before. And this is all going to create the extended supply chain opportunity for the Now platform.  You might have noticed, for example, we acquired Deep Brain, which is a small Company in Denmark because we are in so many different ERP related conversations where we're helping our great ERP friends instead of doing mass customization through consultants that would take years and years. With the Now Platform, you can do it in days. So this is creating a ground swell of opportunity on the ERP level, on the supply chain level, on the finance level, on the procurement level, it's just unbelievable. I mean, I've never seen an opportunity like this in my entire career.\nTyler Radke: All right. Thank you.\nBill Mc Dermott: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just one question from my side. Bill, I was just wondering if you can give us an update in terms of the experience you saw on the quarter around the customer service use case. And then separately when you look at the observability process or progress that you're making, if you can just give us an update on where you stand in moving into that market segment?\nBill Mc Dermott: Yes. Thank you very much, Sterling. I really appreciate it. So let me start with Lightstep first of all because I want to give a big shout out to Ben and his great team. We love Ben. We love his team. And they're just going to be a sensation here. We're continually impressed by the depth of engineering talent at Lightstep and the?absobability? solution. We're still in the early innings of integrating the business as you know, but we've had strong up-sells from existing customers and we're seeing that as a testament to how they value Lightstep's product. And it's already delivering to organizations. It's currently being sold on a stand alone basis. But we expect that to be going to market solidly with ServiceNow, at an enterprise level in 2022.  We're also doing some product direct sales with the Light step product in the Internet channel. And I think that is also a potential elixir that markets may not be expecting from ServiceNow. It's a new play in the playbook and we're pretty excited about it. On CSM, I'm really excited about our leadership in CSM. We have a fantastic leader in CSM with industry renowned experience, and we're winning in verticals everywhere. Whether it's financial services, telecom, healthcare, and life sciences. It's pretty incredible. What you're seeing here, and I actually went through this business review yesterday as well, you're seeing CSM completely rethink direct-to-consumer. You're rethinking Customer Service Management.  And you're thinking about messaging, you're thinking about Whatsapp differently, you're thinking about Twilio and ServiceNow, embedding these really swift solutions for the customer experience. Think about field service management. Think about the connected experience for the ultimate consumer. Yes, other CRM companies have done a very good job on the engagement layer.  Unfortunately, the customer experience doesn't end with the engagement layer. It begins with the engagement layer so the operations layer of the Company and the back office IT capability of the Company has to be tethered to that engagement layer, which is given us net new opportunities, including IoT opportunities with field service and fleets of products, fleets of trucks, fleets of cars, easy marketplaces that we've never seen the likes of.  And then you combine that with the creator workflow, where it's like, Hey, I can have it my way. You mean I can customize that? Yeah. And guess what? When you do the upgrade would ServiceNow, you don't have to get the consulting team into rethink the whole implementation, with us it's invisible. It's like driving a Tesla, you press a button the next day you have a new Tesla, that's what ServiceNow is doing, incredible innovation.\nSterling Auty: That sounds good. Thank you.\nBill Mc Dermott: You're most welcome. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks. Congrats from me as well. Bill, you k now our new areas with [Indiscernible] and observability from the acquisitions a few months ago. What has been the customer feedback? and then since you announced the Loehmann's (ph) well, how do you draw the line between partnership where there was doing yourself and how is that playing out so far. Thank you.\nBill Mc Dermott: Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Raimo. Again, as I said, ServiceNow's platform has process mining. We have RPA,we have machine learning, we have AI ops, we have all the predictive technologies based on the moves we made as you know, built in. But there are non-ServiceNow environments, especially if you think about large scale ERP environment, that's just 1 example where our business processes are fragmented, there are multiple instances of multiple participants, and the customer really needs an X-ray.  What's going on around here? And we combine that knowledge of all the non - ServiceNow environments that require process mining x-ray with what we do ourselves to get a forced multiplier effect. And as a result, so long as it's there, there's no doubt, the gold standard for workflow automation in the enterprise is ServiceNow. Why would we want to spend our time building the gold standard? We partner with you. We move into the x-ray into the action layer and together we offer the customer something they never got before - a great x-ray and an unbelievable immediate value to action process on the Now Platform. And I really think this is a perfect example of trust being the ultimate human currency.  I would've never done the partnership with Alex and Bastian, and Martin and their terrific team. I might add in Munich, Germany, one of my great friends. In the world, I know it's how much I love Germany as the second home. So it's really fun to work with them. They all went to the Technical University of Munich, by the way, we have great relationships. And just think about all the customers in Germany, that are going to hear this news, they are going to be like, wow, I'm trying to modernize my architecture. Can you give me an x-ray and then you can move all the innovation onto an action layer and then I can start to drive business outcomes in days, weeks and months, as opposed to multiple years, I think I signed now,\nRaimo Lenschow: Super, thank you.\nBill Mc Dermott: Thank you very much Raimo.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Congratulations from me as well, guys. I guess, be -- whether it could be for either Bill or Gina. You mentioned, there -- I guess it was an early question from Alex on the future of work. I'm curious, what is ServiceNow's philosophy on the future of work? And I guess -- Bill I'm wondering, as reps -- sales reps get out on the road and there's more in-person conferences, industry conferences. And -- do you suspect that that could help improve pipelines even further than more of a remote selling process?\nBill Mc Dermott: Yeah, Matt, there's no doubt, it's all upside. Because what you're seeing now is a purely digital motion to the marketplace. The great news is CEOs, management teams, and leaders of all kinds and companies, both in the public, and the private sector, have accepted this new way of communication. Which I believe has expedited collaboration, and has expedited decision-making because you don't have the clunkyness and the clumsiness of the heavy travel to get something done in a few minutes as opposed to a few weeks, especially in a global Company, is a blessing.  However, there is nothing that will ever replace humans being in the same room, ideating, collaborating, dreaming, thinking about the next frontier. And that's why it's all upside for us, because we're going to combine everything we're doing now in the playbook with the direct motions. And we're going to leverage the hybrid world both for ourselves, our customers, and our partners. So I actually think the tailwind going into an economy that's opening up is probably underestimated by everybody on the call today.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, super-helpful looking forward to that as we as we look in 2022, congrats, guys.\nBill Mc Dermott: Thank you very much, Matt.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question. It will come from Arjun Bhatia, from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you. And I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Bill, in your prepared remarks, you talked about Companies consolidating, your customers consolidating legacy systems on ServiceNow, I'm curious whether you're starting to get to the point where within the systems that you're replacing, we're starting to see some maybe more modern SaaS applications that are being removed and folded into the Now deployment as well? Or are we still at the space where there's still so much work to be done on legacy, on prem systems or you're not seeing those modern applications fold into your platform?\nBill Mc Dermott: Yeah. I -- it's a really good question Arjun what I'm saying is there's still a massive set of customers out there with legacy. And what you're also seeing and Gina as an example, is our internal champion on ESG. We're sure beautifully with the engineering team when we announced one of the greatest ESG in a box solutions in the world. Actually I think it's the only one in the world. But what's amazing is there's all these islands of automation. Everybody is doing something good that's a modern system or a modern product or a modern tool that's fine. But it doesn't necessarily unify on a common architecture where there is security, there is enterprise coherence.  There is business operations, there is one end-to-end process that includes all the people, all the processes, and all the technology, and that's where the Now Platform comes in. And is especially true, in the world of 20th century architectures, because even if you move them to a Cloud, just think about the costs, the time, the risk, and the companies that are dealing with do or die moments today, they just don't want to wait. So to have an action platform that can absolutely simulate the perfect enterprise at record speed, and I might add with a gorgeous consumer grade UX, is a sensational business case. And that's why you're seeing the deals get bigger.  You've seen us go into a platform Company model and you now see that service now is their clear sensation? It's because we're giving the customer what they want, and what I also learned -- and I think it's an important attribute of our engineering culture and our great engineering leader and all of his leaders on -- we always say here at ServiceNow that our strategy is informed by our customers strategy and deeply understanding their issues and their opportunities. And we're so quick to be able to innovate and get new releases out to market at excellent quality. And then even the ones that we didn't get out in the release can be handled by the creator workflow platform.  We also build something inside of ServiceNow called NowX, where we have a series of on deck organic innovations that are going to hit the market and take it by storm. I had an earlier question on supply chain. That's one of the major areas where we're focused on. So, there's such an opportunity with legacy there's still such an opportunity to unify these enterprises on common platforms. There's such an opportunity for hyper automations, to automate what people thought they already automated. That I just can't see any constraint to the growth agenda of ServiceNow.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nBill Mc Dermott: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Mc Dermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Lisa. And good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our Q3 earnings call. While a beat and raise headline from ServiceNow is familiar, it is no less extraordinary. Our team delivered another outstanding quarter, yet again, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31% organically. This is unprecedented in our Industry. CRPO was up 32%, subscription billings were up 28%. Operating margin was 26%. We again have raised our guidance for the full year, strengthening our clear path to 15 billion plus in revenue by 2026. I was introduced to ServiceNow CEO more than 2 years ago. We've all seen a lot since then. What we've never seen, is such consistent innovation and execution at global scale.  Thanks to our customers, employees, and partner, we're well on our way to becoming that defining enterprise software Company of the 21st Century. And we're only getting started. Before Gina gives you a complete report, let's talk about this dramatic structural incline at ServiceNow. The pace of digital investment is accelerating. IDC has consistently sized this opportunity at 7.8 trillion over a 4-year period. With its massive addressable market, ServiceNow is at the intersection of 2 generational opportunities. First, the need for new technology foundation is supercharging our close partnership with [Indiscernible]. A recent Wall Street Journal report highlighted the role of [Indiscernible] as the architects of digital business. Ongoing advances in public Cloud and machine learning, are for forging a new era of software innovation.  Technology teams want a fully integrated software cycle; planning, development, deployment, operations, and service. ServiceNow, is leading this 20th to 21st Century migration for our customers. The Now platform with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control tower for digital transformation. With second dimension fueling ServiceNow is the reordering of the enterprise application platforms for hyper automation. Leaders today recognize their technology architecture is their business architecture. Over several decades, enterprise that invested trillions is on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications. These applications satisfied the business process needs of the 20th century.  Today, new business models require a fully connected value chain. Legacy environments are not adaptive enough to enable this change. As the pioneer of modern digital workflows ServiceNow, in leading the renaissance. The Now platform connects different applications and data sources to create intuitive, mobile experiences all at a consumer grade. We don't ask businesses to bet everything on a single system or collaboration tool. We get choice, which not only unlocks value from our platform, but from other platform investments as well. ServiceNow also empowers anyone to build applications on our platform. In it's low-code development technologies report, Gartner estimates that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code, or no code technologies.  Gartner, also named ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant. These tailwinds are driving fast organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio. The number of deals greater than a million dollars was 63 up 50% year-over-year, signaling substantial adoption of our platform strategy. In Q3, IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 18 of our top 20 deals, while IT operations management, had 10 deals over a million. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is in a multi-year digital transformation effort. In Q3 they chose ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform so support the agencies mission critical operations. Demand for our entire IT portfolio is strong.  And with the launch of Light step incident response in Q3, we're unlocking a new wave of product lead growth in application monitoring and observability. Employee Workflows also had a fantastic quarter, with HR in 13 of our top 20 deals. In Q3, NTT data will leverage the Now platform to create an employee experience portal enhancing productivity for hybrid work, and managing vaccine administration for it's entire workforce. Momentum continues for customer workflows, with CSM in 12 of our top 20 deals, and 8 deals over a million. Industry Verticals Solutions are leading the way with major brands. Verizon is adopting our Telco Solution, American Century, our financial services solutions, and Sunbelt Health, our healthcare solutions.  Creator workflows which helps businesses build their own applications was exceptional in Q3, in 18 of our top 20 deals. We're partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring ServiceNow as new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to change how they serve their customers. Together, we're maximizing facility up time and delivering great experiences to distributors, dealers, and end consumers. Fujitsu will also expand it's use in the Now platform to drive its own digital transformation. we couldn't be prouder that Uber, Honeywell, Trulia, and many others all chose ServiceNow in Q3. This is a complete performance for the Company. Strong growth across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific Japan.  As we look to a strong finish in 2021 and beyond, here are a few of the many factors giving us great confidence in this business. First, while a lot of talent is raging out there, we're highly encouraged by the colleagues choosing ServiceNow in record numbers. Our new joiners together with our amazing global workforce, are building a uniquely inclusive, driven, and happy culture. We're also seeing major developments and our partner ecosystem. Just 3 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Celonis.  Celonis will deliver process mining insights, ServiceNow will build better workflows, our customers will gain from the integrated approach. We also defend our long-standing partnership with Microsoft. ServiceNow's employees center, can now be directly embedded in Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users. Together with our expanding partner community, we will reduce complexity to make work better for people. Finally, innovation without disruption is a hallmark of our best-in-class engineering tradition. When we stay without disruption, we mean invisible.  A seamless upgrade experience for our customers. In our Now platform roam release, we delivered countless new features to customers. Including, mobile app builder, an automation discovery tool, employee journey management, and new customer service play box. Every business leader in the world, is looking at the future and work. These new features give the Now platform even more capability to build that hybrid future. I'll refer to a comment made by industry analyst, Josh Passon (ph), who said, our own platform release. This Company seems to be able to build and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen and that's why they are juggernaut. Josh, naturally, I agree.  In closing, the Company as firing on all cylinders, the quarter speaks for itself. We beat again, we raise again. The secular tailwinds are at our backs. Our customer base is expanding, just as our customer NPS is increasing. Our partner ecosystem is fired up. We accelerated our timeline to be net 0. We help businesses drive their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release. The list goes on and on. Overall, our message to the market couldn't be any clearer. Whatever systems, challenges, or opportunities you have, however fast you need to move, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow. We want to make the world work better for everyone, and we'll never lose our focus on the privilege that comes with saying, \"The world works with ServiceNow. \" I look forward to your questions. Gina, over to you. Well, Kash. Thank you very much for your kind remarks. You called the progress of our share price early on in the year, congratulations to you, you had it nailed. A couple of things, Kash. If you look at the geographies around the world, every single geography not only beat expectations, but they actually beat our internal plan handily. So every geography is expanding with ServiceNow at a record [Indiscernible]. If you look at our expansion in industry, we saw growth across all of our industry categories this quarter, it's amazing. Industries that were COVID impacted like transportation, logistics, business services, telecom, media, technology, financial services, government education, every single one of them was unbelievable success story this quarter.  And we have expanded dramatically in manufacturing, healthcare, life sciences, telecommunications, and banking. just to name a few. So think GEO, think industry, also think persona. This employee workflow business of ours is unstoppable because the employee experience is unstoppable, especially in a labor market that requires talent. And as you pointed out [Indiscernible] remarks are absolutely right. The GDP growth in tech is inescapable because it's the only way out, in a hybrid world to manage a competitive Company especially when you're competing for talent and you have to give them a great experience.  Example, on-boarding experience, connecting all of their training tools, really making them a part of the culture when they might not even be in your buildings. Customer workflows, we announced a partnership with Twilio. Dealing with what's app and various messaging techniques, because all the old school ways are going away quickly. So with our CSM, our employee workflows, the experiences we're giving to people, is just unreal. And don't forget the creator workflows. 500 million net new applications will be developed in the next 2 plus years. And that will be developed for companies, by companies in their own technology departments and there's not enough engineers to do that in the world.  So the Now Platform is a growth sensation. All of these forces are coming together at once. And that is why I could not be more confident in the bullish stance on ServiceNow, not just in the short term, we run our business with clear messaging, clear facts. We could see the pipeline way into 2022 and some cases beyond. It is a fantastic situation right now, Kash. And Kash on your question with respect to the '22. Obviously, it's a bit early to talk guidance, but you are 100% correct. Our renewal base is very strong. We've seen very strong net new ACV acceleration throughout the year, as I've been talking about. And so we feel really bullish on the opportunities ahead of us in '22. The one thing that I would note is that FX has turned against us a little bit as we head into '22. And so I'm sure you would have all seen especially with respect to the euro, the dollar increasing. And so we have a bit of a headwind on FX as we look into '22. But feel really good about the underlying health of the business, our renewal of our net new ACV. And so we're poised to have a strong 2022. Very gratifying, brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you, [Indiscernible]. Kirk, thank you very much for your question. We had a very, very strong federal quarter. 15 deals over a million, 14 federal agencies are now paying us more than 10 million. Key strategic wins included the IRS, which I talked about already, but it's certainly not limited to that. It's pretty amazing how the government is rethinking strategies in terms of communication and providing the services digitally to the citizens, which is incredible because as you know, that's all about the user experience and it's a workflow challenge. For example, look at how difficult it was for the government to get money out to small businesses during COVID.  There also were some big opportunities with new initiatives in the administration including resiliency, our business continuity, outages, terrorism, COVID, cyber security on top of many lists. The White House actually put out an executive order on improving the nation's cyber security after recent ransom attacks. So that's all workflow related leveraging existing systems that don't talk to each other very well. You certainly not going to rip and replace them, so that's where the Now platform comes in. And then just think about vaccine management, it remains one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces.  And boosters now will likely need to be re-administered on a regular basis. This again is a workflow challenge to distribute, administer, and monitor vaccines. We're in the mix on all of that. And what we're seeing is the connection of federal, state, and cities. They're all implementing the Now platform to engage with citizens. They're using products like Customer Service Management to help digitize these workflows that can no longer be processed in person, because the offices are still closed during the pandemic.  So overall, take this as a strong, aggressive, bullish, confident reply that the public sector is embracing the Now platform as its transformational opportunity at federal, state, local, university, and all public entities that are quickly embracing us. Because our Net Promoter Score is so high and we're a mouse that's saying this is the way to go, go now. Yeah. Brad, thank you very much. The quick answer is the creator workflow platform. But what you're seeing out there is many businesses really have not maximized the value of their digital investments because they lack insight into the inefficiency of their processes. And that's what's holding back their business operations. So if you want to move the needle, organizations are going to need to understand how work is done across people, processes, and systems. So what's happening here is ServiceNow and Celonis that help customer map those elements in real-time, and then build digital workflows to more efficiently automated work.  So we're going to create a seamless product experience for customers that's going to make it easy and simple for them to get insight into their processes across multiple enterprise systems. You'll be able to use Celonis 's EMS platform, and convert that insight, the x-ray, into action, automation, and remediation on the ServiceNow workflow platform. So think about brand to get the process mining, automation machine learning, RPA, and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience that customers will be enabled to quickly and continuously improve the flow of work.  So, shorter answer is the creative workflow platform, but what's happening is Celonis gets the x-ray, especially in the non ServiceNow environments. And then we use all the power of the Now platform, including process mining in the ServiceNow environment to give them a fast automation platform to make that business process home and really drive business outcome. I think this one is going to be really exciting and I thank my good partners, Alex and Bastian and Martin. I know our engineers are very committed to each other and we were going to nail it. Yeah. It's amazing. We literally had a review of this business just yesterday, and our outstanding leader just took us through it. And what you're basically saying is, the Now platform is integrated with all systems of record. So customers can build applications fast. And we really are the platform of all the other platforms. I've been seeing platform or platforms for a long time. And I want to make it clear we respect all those other platforms, all those other excellent brands. Our job is to make all of them even better by moving into the action layer or the hyper-automation layer on the Now platform.  And a trend we're seeing is, the younger generation of workers, they're not going to submit tickets. They want action. So enterprises are creating these centers of excellence, and they're letting students and developers build the solution to solve for the business challenges. I believe that hyper-automation is a key differentiator,, and because we have this 1 platform that does it all, RPA low-code process mining all on a single platform, and now with Celonis we get process mining in the non-service now environments, we bring everything together so customers can completely rethink their business model.  Example I gave in the script is Stanley Blacker their base -- Stanley Black & Decker. They're combining their new manufacturing vertical solution with the App Engine to build over 70 custom applications. This is all being done on the now low-code application platform. And our Fujitsu also is an example where they using App Engine to drive digital transformation and sustainability across the Company, moving the green line, not just the top and bottom line. Thank you very much for the question. Appreciate it, Brett. You should think of ServiceNow as a growth Company. As a Company that is firing on all cylinders and as a Company that is attracting the best talent in the industry. And that's really a sustaining part of our success. I'll give you an example, you take somebody like Erica Volini, who joined from Deloitte, she had a fantastic career at Deloitte. And she wanted to come in and help us transform the service experience for our customers. We're collapsing the pre and post-sale conversation. Everything here is about business impact and we're rethinking the whole services model. That's why our customer satisfaction and our net promoter score, is soaring. Not just our retention, we're focused on the in-process measures.  That's why Jon Ziglar (ph) came to us after great career at Apple, Microsoft and sales force and said, he believes that the Now platform was the future of business. And what we have been able to do is, hire thousands of people, even in a pandemic. Because the Now platform enables us to create the seamless hiring on-boarding, immediately scaling people off to our culture and their training needs, and then managing them in a hybrid world in a way that gives them the experience of our culture, and the word gets out there quickly. We are literally harder to get into the Stanford statistically, even as you see thousands joining.  So we are not opportunity constrained, and that's what I've been saying the whole time. Why are we organically growing? Why are we committed to our engineering? Why are we fiercely committed to our market leadership? Because we can be, this is the plant of this generation and we're investing primarily in great engineers and go-to-market, especially quota-bearing, where we can deliver for our shareholders, our customers, and our partners. The other thing I want to underscore is we have really expanded the ecosystem. So as you even see us hiring thousands, just think the Ecosystem is hiring even more thousands on thousands, to get around this Now platform and get their piece of the action in GEOS, in industries and Personas, this is a growth story. Thanks. Alex, it's a great question. I could not be -- I could not possibly be more confident in our our ability to achieve the 15 billion plus on an organic basis by 2026, which is exactly what I said at the Investor Day. And I also underscore the fact that we recognize that our balance sheet is extremely strong and will be even stronger as we move into the future. And we continue to source, look at, consider all options that would benefit shareholder value creation without ever passing on any tech debt to customers as many others have done.  So, just know that everything is always on the table, but at this time there are no substantial acquisitions on the table, not a single one. And we could not be more confident in our organic growth. In fact, that's where we're looking at our investments and we're prioritizing them because we're certainly not opportunity constrained, Alex. The Company is in fantastic shape. Yes, you should expect it to continue, Tyler. The reality is we've become a platform Company. I came in a couple of years ago now, and we've really seen the transformation of the Company to full-scale enterprise software companies. And we took the strength that we had in IT and we have made it really our hallmark because it's very clear now in this world, as the world is dealing with digital transformation, everybody understands that the technology architecture is the business architecture.  And that has given us enormous responsibility, but also permission to expand the perimeter into the employee experience, into Customer Service Management, including direct-to-consumer, field service management. This create a workflow business which is just an absolute sensation ties together so many of these just disjointed processes systems and silos and enterprises today, and really puts together an enterprise software market leading approach from ServiceNow, so think of us as an enterprise player on a platform that is unstoppable. Yeah, actually, it's a great question, Tyler, because I know in some industries they talk about the supply chain dilemma and boat off the port with a lot of things in them. But this is actually an opportunity for us, because what's happening now is companies have to reorient their business models. They have to think about their extended supply chain. They have to rewire who their partners are actually going to be, and who they're not going to be. How they're going to source things from different places in the world that they've never even worked with before. And this is all going to create the extended supply chain opportunity for the Now platform.  You might have noticed, for example, we acquired Deep Brain, which is a small Company in Denmark because we are in so many different ERP related conversations where we're helping our great ERP friends instead of doing mass customization through consultants that would take years and years. With the Now Platform, you can do it in days. So this is creating a ground swell of opportunity on the ERP level, on the supply chain level, on the finance level, on the procurement level, it's just unbelievable. I mean, I've never seen an opportunity like this in my entire career. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you very much, Sterling. I really appreciate it. So let me start with Lightstep first of all because I want to give a big shout out to Ben and his great team. We love Ben. We love his team. And they're just going to be a sensation here. We're continually impressed by the depth of engineering talent at Lightstep and the?absobability? solution. We're still in the early innings of integrating the business as you know, but we've had strong up-sells from existing customers and we're seeing that as a testament to how they value Lightstep's product. And it's already delivering to organizations. It's currently being sold on a stand alone basis. But we expect that to be going to market solidly with ServiceNow, at an enterprise level in 2022.  We're also doing some product direct sales with the Light step product in the Internet channel. And I think that is also a potential elixir that markets may not be expecting from ServiceNow. It's a new play in the playbook and we're pretty excited about it. On CSM, I'm really excited about our leadership in CSM. We have a fantastic leader in CSM with industry renowned experience, and we're winning in verticals everywhere. Whether it's financial services, telecom, healthcare, and life sciences. It's pretty incredible. What you're seeing here, and I actually went through this business review yesterday as well, you're seeing CSM completely rethink direct-to-consumer. You're rethinking Customer Service Management.  And you're thinking about messaging, you're thinking about Whatsapp differently, you're thinking about Twilio and ServiceNow, embedding these really swift solutions for the customer experience. Think about field service management. Think about the connected experience for the ultimate consumer. Yes, other CRM companies have done a very good job on the engagement layer.  Unfortunately, the customer experience doesn't end with the engagement layer. It begins with the engagement layer so the operations layer of the Company and the back office IT capability of the Company has to be tethered to that engagement layer, which is given us net new opportunities, including IoT opportunities with field service and fleets of products, fleets of trucks, fleets of cars, easy marketplaces that we've never seen the likes of.  And then you combine that with the creator workflow, where it's like, Hey, I can have it my way. You mean I can customize that? Yeah. And guess what? When you do the upgrade would ServiceNow, you don't have to get the consulting team into rethink the whole implementation, with us it's invisible. It's like driving a Tesla, you press a button the next day you have a new Tesla, that's what ServiceNow is doing, incredible innovation. You're most welcome. Thank you for the question. Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Raimo. Again, as I said, ServiceNow's platform has process mining. We have RPA,we have machine learning, we have AI ops, we have all the predictive technologies based on the moves we made as you know, built in. But there are non-ServiceNow environments, especially if you think about large scale ERP environment, that's just 1 example where our business processes are fragmented, there are multiple instances of multiple participants, and the customer really needs an X-ray.  What's going on around here? And we combine that knowledge of all the non - ServiceNow environments that require process mining x-ray with what we do ourselves to get a forced multiplier effect. And as a result, so long as it's there, there's no doubt, the gold standard for workflow automation in the enterprise is ServiceNow. Why would we want to spend our time building the gold standard? We partner with you. We move into the x-ray into the action layer and together we offer the customer something they never got before - a great x-ray and an unbelievable immediate value to action process on the Now Platform. And I really think this is a perfect example of trust being the ultimate human currency.  I would've never done the partnership with Alex and Bastian, and Martin and their terrific team. I might add in Munich, Germany, one of my great friends. In the world, I know it's how much I love Germany as the second home. So it's really fun to work with them. They all went to the Technical University of Munich, by the way, we have great relationships. And just think about all the customers in Germany, that are going to hear this news, they are going to be like, wow, I'm trying to modernize my architecture. Can you give me an x-ray and then you can move all the innovation onto an action layer and then I can start to drive business outcomes in days, weeks and months, as opposed to multiple years, I think I signed now, Thank you very much Raimo. Yeah, Matt, there's no doubt, it's all upside. Because what you're seeing now is a purely digital motion to the marketplace. The great news is CEOs, management teams, and leaders of all kinds and companies, both in the public, and the private sector, have accepted this new way of communication. Which I believe has expedited collaboration, and has expedited decision-making because you don't have the clunkyness and the clumsiness of the heavy travel to get something done in a few minutes as opposed to a few weeks, especially in a global Company, is a blessing.  However, there is nothing that will ever replace humans being in the same room, ideating, collaborating, dreaming, thinking about the next frontier. And that's why it's all upside for us, because we're going to combine everything we're doing now in the playbook with the direct motions. And we're going to leverage the hybrid world both for ourselves, our customers, and our partners. So I actually think the tailwind going into an economy that's opening up is probably underestimated by everybody on the call today. Thank you very much, Matt. Yeah. I -- it's a really good question Arjun what I'm saying is there's still a massive set of customers out there with legacy. And what you're also seeing and Gina as an example, is our internal champion on ESG. We're sure beautifully with the engineering team when we announced one of the greatest ESG in a box solutions in the world. Actually I think it's the only one in the world. But what's amazing is there's all these islands of automation. Everybody is doing something good that's a modern system or a modern product or a modern tool that's fine. But it doesn't necessarily unify on a common architecture where there is security, there is enterprise coherence.  There is business operations, there is one end-to-end process that includes all the people, all the processes, and all the technology, and that's where the Now Platform comes in. And is especially true, in the world of 20th century architectures, because even if you move them to a Cloud, just think about the costs, the time, the risk, and the companies that are dealing with do or die moments today, they just don't want to wait. So to have an action platform that can absolutely simulate the perfect enterprise at record speed, and I might add with a gorgeous consumer grade UX, is a sensational business case. And that's why you're seeing the deals get bigger.  You've seen us go into a platform Company model and you now see that service now is their clear sensation? It's because we're giving the customer what they want, and what I also learned -- and I think it's an important attribute of our engineering culture and our great engineering leader and all of his leaders on -- we always say here at ServiceNow that our strategy is informed by our customers strategy and deeply understanding their issues and their opportunities. And we're so quick to be able to innovate and get new releases out to market at excellent quality. And then even the ones that we didn't get out in the release can be handled by the creator workflow platform.  We also build something inside of ServiceNow called NowX, where we have a series of on deck organic innovations that are going to hit the market and take it by storm. I had an earlier question on supply chain. That's one of the major areas where we're focused on. So, there's such an opportunity with legacy there's still such an opportunity to unify these enterprises on common platforms. There's such an opportunity for hyper automations, to automate what people thought they already automated. That I just can't see any constraint to the growth agenda of ServiceNow. Thank you very much. Appreciate it."

            "content": "Thank you Bill. Q3 was another fantastic quarter with continued out-performance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics. Demand was strong globally across all 3 of our GEOS. The consistency of our results quarter-after-quarter exemplifies the strength of our product portfolio, and it seems focused on building deep customer relationships. Q3, subscription revenues of $1.43 billion, $22 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of 100 basis points tailwind from FX. RPO ended the quarter at approximately 9.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth.  Current RPO was approximately 5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth and a 2 point beat versus our guidance. Currency did not have an impact on year-over-year growth. Q3 subscription billings of 1.38 billion representing 28% year-over-year growth and a $55 million beat versus the high-end of our guidance. Assets and duration were 150 basis points tailwind year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength across the industries we serve with transportation and logistics and business services, seeing particularly robust net new ACV growth. Our renewal rate was a healthy 98% in Q3, a testament to the value ServiceNow delivers to our customers.  We view our relationship with customers as long-term partnerships, and we continually innovate to provide new solutions to address their evolving business needs. The land in expand motion has manifested into a base of 1,266 customers paying us over 1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. As the breadth of our portfolio and the addressable opportunities end have expanded, so too have our deal sizes. Because 63 deals greater than 1 million net new ACV in the quarter up over 50% year-over-year. And in Q3, all of our top 20 deals included 4 or more products. Turning to profitability.  Operating margin was 26%, 3 points above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat. We also saw savings from the delay and return to work and lower travel. Our free cash flow margin is 15%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty, and significant applies to be gained. By delivering more intelligent automation that provides even better experiences, we are well positioned as the workflow standard on our journey to becoming a $15 billion plus revenue Company.  Turning to guidance, we're raising our guidance for the full year. We're raising our subscription revenues outlook by 32 million at the midpoint to a range of 5.565 billion to 5.57 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth, including 200 basis points of FX tailwind. We're raising our subscription billings outlook by 61 million at the midpoint to a range of 6.379 billion to 6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes a net tailwind from [Indiscernible] and duration of 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85%, and we're raising our full-year 2021 operating margins from 24.5% to 25%.  This reflects the increase in our top-line growth and savings from the delay of [Indiscernible] work and lower travel. We're also raising our full-year 2021 free cash flow margin by 50 basis points from 31% to 31.5%. And we expect diluted weighted average upsetting shares of 202 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between 1.515 billion and 1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a negligible impact from FX. We expect the RPO growth of 27% year-over-year. This includes the 150 basis points FX headwind due to the sharp movements recently in the euro and pound. On a constant currency basis, we expect the RPO growth to be 28.5%.  We expect the system billing between 2.305 billion and 2.301 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in Q4 of 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year-over-year at the midpoint. Growth includes the net headwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. We expect an operating margin on 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spend in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022.  And we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, the pace of digital investment is accelerating and ServiceNow is rising up to seize the opportunities before us. The team has never been more engaged and focused on serving the enormous needs of our customers. And as ServiceNow becomes the defining enterprise software Company of the 21st century, we are also remaining steadfast in our goal to create positive impact in the world.  I'm happy to announce that in September we committed to reaching our net zero emissions goal by 2030, 2 decades earlier than our previous goal. We've never been prouder of our employees and they're continued focus on serving our customers, partners, and community. As they make not only work, work better, but the world work better too. Our hungry and humble culture is stronger than ever, we can't thank our employees enough enough for their hard work and dedication. And with that, I'll look it up for Q&A. Thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. Listen, I think we are really proud of the Q3 beat that we saw. Bill talked about all GEOS operating on all cylinders. And that's across the geographies, across all of the product portfolios. And so we were really pleased with the beat that we saw in Q3. We absolutely continue to see more business back-half-weighted to Q4. That is going to be a trend that we continue to see.  When you look at our Q4 results and our Q4 guide, you have to remember last year Q4. We had that 80 million of early payment that were brought forward, that really drove a higher growth number in Q4. And if you normalize that -- it's why I called out pretty transparently in the script. If you normalized for that, we're seeing 32% growth in Q4 billing. And so a really strong guide given our scale and our base. Great. Thank you. And Tamar on your follow-up question with respect to Q4. And so I talked a bit about the normalized billings. So that's 32% for Q4. We actually have a 50 basis points FX headwind in Q4 of this year versus we had 150 basis points tailwind in Q3. So we really are moving in the right direction. What I would also call out is last year Q4, saw a tremendous growth, even when you normalize for those 80 million in collection.  And so we are basically at 32% growth in Q4, this year is normalized, on top of a 32% growth last year. So strong growth upon strong growth, I will say also that not only did we raise the guide for Q4 by our Q3 B, but we increased it by another 13 million in billings. We are seeing headwinds in Q4 for FX, but excluding that constant currency, constant duration growth is really strong. Thank you. Yeah. We're really pleased with our new logos, both from Q4 of last year and throughout 2021. We're seeing strong growth even in Q3 with 6 new customers greater than a million dollars, and they're across industries, just in Q3 alone, that's banking, retail, manufacturing, and energy, just to name a few. We are absolutely seeing our deal sizes grow. New customers, average deal size grow quarter-on-quarter, and year-on-year. And we're seeing healthy growth abroad in EMEA and APJ as well. And so we're really focused on evolving our land to the right new customer. And IC continues to be a high percentage of those new logos. And we're seeing we are actually seeing a much higher percentage also, of land occurring with CSN, App Engine and HR, and so those cohorts are growing very well. Our expansion rate is doing very well, and just really firing on all cylinders across all 3 of our geographies. It's a great question and so rightfully so, you took into account the FX is impacting our CPR -- C RPO. Most of the remaining CRPO growth as I already said, is actually due to seasonality within our renewal cohort. And so our typical customer contracts as far as you know, is around 36 months on average, and we have a large cohort coming up for renewal in 2022. So this is starting to flow out of Q4 of this year. Which because of one included the future renewals until they renew with pipeline sale.  And so that deceleration is really what's driving that -- it's the seasonality of the cohort that's driving that deceleration. And once that cohort renews in 2022 and with 98% renewal rates across-the-board, we feel really good and strong about our renewal base, that will have a stabilizing impact with the RPO growth into 2022. Awesome. Absolutely, it's a great question. Thank you so much, Alex. So, first of all, 100% I noticed that many of our learnings from working remotely will absolutely have lasting effect on our overall efficiency. But I've been pretty transparent throughout the year, that it does give us the ability and the agility to redeploy savings elsewhere. Like Bill just talked about organic growth. We are at an inflection point where we have no lack of opportunity and we are a first and foremost a growth Company and we will absolutely invest behind that. That being said, at our Financial Analysis Day in May, I talked about committing to 26.5% margin by 2024. We absolutely remain committed to that and on that trajectory, but I don't think that, that increase is going to be linear.  As we think about offices reopening, and travel becoming more consistent and in-person events happening more. We definitely don't believe that it's going to be a linear path to 26.5. I'm not actually in a position at this point to guide the 2022, but we are 100% committed to over that 3-year period, getting to 26.5. Because we absolutely believe that will have savings that will be able to pay from these learning and efficiencies from the pandemic and redeploy them on growth opportunities that we see absolutely in front of us today."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the call over to your first speaker today Lisa Banks, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may begin your conference.\nLisa Banks: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for ServiceNow\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distances and other mitigation requirements. The continued impact of COVID-19 on customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and the length of our sales cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. We also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations or RPO and current RPO or cRPO. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and our investor presentation. These and all prior press releases and investor presentation are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25% and the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51 up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year, an incredible performance by our team and exceptional first half. And we have unstoppable momentum and we\u2019ve reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3 times faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do or die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solution they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world\u2019s biggest challenges [are service now] [(ph), as big as the opportunities, from vaccine management to ESG to the new world of hybrid work. Whatever the challenge work flows with ServiceNow. We\u2019ve created a new market. One that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today\u2019s digital business demands. The Now platform, the platform of platforms delivers workflow automation, where the consumers raise user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across the enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges and maintaining on target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and they are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage this complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. It\u2019s just one example of the power of the Now platform. I\u2019d like to share an overview of our success of core ServiceNow\u2019s portfolio. Let\u2019s begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. Our AI powered service operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They\u2019re working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we\u2019re honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts and it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. With employee workflows we make work better by driving outstanding employee experience that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere, while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now platform provides employees a system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving, and many more moments that matter for people, employee workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. [Asahi] (ph) for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. With customer workflows, we\u2019re creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that we define customer operations for greatest speed, agility, transparency, and convenience all while working with existing systems. Customer workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals with four deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow\u2019s telecommunications solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process enabling a 360 degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure creating a seamless connected experience for DT\u2019s employees and customers. With creative workflows, we\u2019re accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than three months using ServiceNow\u2019s low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2 creative workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow\u2019s creative workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now buying program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility all while improving business impact, continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now buying program with Deloitte, who will take advantage of our old products suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients, while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft teams, regardless of the employee\u2019s location in the hybrid work environment. In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team passion to solving the world\u2019s greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business. In our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It\u2019s been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It\u2019s a privilege to help the world reopen and safely returned to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society\u2019s biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. We are better than we were yesterday not as good as will be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions. But first, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metric. The team demonstrated exceptional execution and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. Q2 subscription revenues was $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of a 450 basis points tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligation or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a $4.3 billion versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billing to $1.328 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth by $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance, FX and duration where 500 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. We saw growth across all our industry categories, financial services and manufacturing are particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity. Industry is impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. The Now platform remains a mission critical part of our customer\u2019s operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness that our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land and expand growth strategy. This was evident that the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers payments over $1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we close 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We\u2019re also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio, instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. Turning to profitability, operating margin was 25%, three points above our guidance driven by the strong revenue beat G&A cost saving and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. And we\u2019ve heard from Bill, the macro trends starting digital transformation or significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May, included two amazing weeks of keynote, panels and discussion that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and healthcare industry product and showcase the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflow. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account without 45% year-over-year. Together, the macro tailwind and interest generated from knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We\u2019re raising our subscription revenues outlook by $73 million at the midpoint point to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlets by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes in that tailwind and FX duration, 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85% and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top-line growth, more efficient marketing spend and stayed in some continued lower G&A expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year of 2021 free cash margin by one point from 30% to 31%. I\u2019ve note that from a seasonality perspective, we\u2019re expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect subscription billing between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes the net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings in the four quarter rolling basis, we\u2019ll help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is a digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business and we are well on our way to becoming $15 billion revenue company. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s performance this quarter and Bill and I can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication. And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, congrats on a very strong second quarter. Bill, can you talk a little bit to the growing pipeline that you kind of mentioned here on the call? Just talk a little bit about sales cycles, I would assume that helping you this year, but also kind of sets the foundation for next year. Just any color there would be nice. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Sure. Thank you very much, Raimo, for the question. First, I\u2019d like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership, as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company, because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever all the systems even exist in the company, I couldn\u2019t pick out of a lineup, because only thing we look at as Now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that\u2019s moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust. And it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year as is our engineering leader and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina\u2019s value and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart, because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information. It\u2019s very, very strong. In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT is the stronghold on so many things now, because if you want to give the employees a great experience that you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT business around creating these new workflows, which is necessary, because there\u2019s not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required. Everybody can agree on the Now platform and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. And then any early feedback from the customers around Lightstep, because that\u2019s obviously like expanding your TAM quite a bit, what has been the early feedback from the customer base. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Yes, I really like to thank Ben and his team for their trust in ServiceNow, and Pablo and CJ and our great engineering team for the work that they\u2019re doing together. What we think is that ServiceNow has proven capabilities combined with Lightstep\u2019s observability technology will really help organizations seamlessly connect, because that\u2019s the big deal, seamlessly connect the insights in that data form the necessary patterns in that data. And then action them into the workflow which enables people process and technology to truly deliver great experiences for the customers and the employees and I think what differentiates us uniquely is this is one pane of glass. It\u2019s one user experience, and it is not just the developer operations, you\u2019ll also see business executives align on this as well. And to us that\u2019s going to really help organization seamlessly connect their digital experiences across the enterprise. Again, the platform I can\u2019t stress this enough, the digital platform, the Now platform is the glue that\u2019s tying it all together.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Well done.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey guys. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about the power of the platform with really a consumer grade interface, but also I think the simplifying buying process new ELAs is really powerful and you called out Deloitte, I guess I wanted to double-click on that a bit and really the importance of this simplifying buying process and how you see that benefiting really new account acquisition as well as expansion.\nBill McDermott: Yes, absolutely Matt. The main thing is speed, right. We\u2019re in a market that is very robust. Digital transformation is really hot and we are that signature brand. So the more quickly we can evolve the upgrade process and the net new deals to get customers live, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. So when you think about the Now buying program, we\u2019re looking at larger rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process as you rightly point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation, our innovators, they\u2019re just so amazing here. Every time you turn around and the next release is a new breakthrough, I just can\u2019t thank them enough. ITSM Pro and enterprise are doing terrific, and this is enabling customers to try things as well. And exchange or adopt products at their will, and it\u2019s giving them a forward look at where we\u2019re going with our roadmaps. And when they see the innovation powered ServiceNow that actually buys them in very quickly. And finally, I would just like to say, we\u2019ve done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company, but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure that the customer understands the value they realized. So as they step in to bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success support and value, and they can carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say, this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you; I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today, where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems that they standardized on the Now platform. So it\u2019s just really good for the customer and it\u2019s good for our folks too to get the customer to value fast.\nMatt Hedberg: Makes sense. Maybe just a quick one for Gina. Last quarter, you talked about net new ACV acceleration, and I guess maybe I can assume based on your increased guidance, what the answer is, be curious if you have any thoughts on net new ACV.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So I talked about net new ACV accelerating in 2021 versus 2020. And we have definitely seen that happening across the board and with our strong beat in Q2 and our raise in the back-half the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing is actually greater than initially anticipated.\nMatt Hedberg: Great to hear. Thanks a lot, guys.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much and hearty congratulations on another spectacular quarter. I couldn\u2019t help, but notice that the net new ACV contribution from your core IT business \u2013 workflow business was up very sharply, curious to get your thoughts on what\u2019s happening in that segment of the market. And Bill, I also noticed that the headcount in sales and marketing also went up pretty significantly. Can you just talk about, what the implications are for number one, the increase in net new business coming from your core business, coupled with what seems to be a pretty gigantic increase in sales and marketing, which I guess is a positive. But I just want you to give me the implications of these two observations. Thank you so much and congrats.\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much Kash. And thank you for all the things that you saw in the Now platform and our leadership in the market, I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers. Because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent, they want to leverage other technologies that they\u2019ve already invested in, of course, we\u2019re so accommodating to that, because our great engineers have built all out of the box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it\u2019s kind of started with the core and now it\u2019s moving across the enterprise with great speed and all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans and they\u2019re all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry is amazing. So I would just like to give you a feel for this Kash by just saying, like, we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation core as we expand the perimeter to employee and customer service management and now creator our great sales leadership sees the opportunity and they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline. And we\u2019re trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that\u2019s a high class situation, because most companies are complaining about the [war on] (ph) talent and they\u2019re actually suffering because they don\u2019t have enough talented people to do the job. We\u2019re only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow and the hardest part our recruiting team\u2019s doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes. So I think it\u2019s great that we\u2019re actually hiring ahead. We see a great hockey stick in the pipeline and I have tremendous confidence in our sales leadership all over the world.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, brilliant. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So I want to ask a similar question in that, around the ELA cycle and the deals that you talked about. Can you comment on how common that is for your pipeline right now versus maybe in previous years and give us a sense for the kind of magnitude of upsell that is possible when customers move at an accelerated pace to these enterprise buying activities.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Alex. I mean, the good news is, it\u2019s early \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very small part of our results and a very, very small part of our pipeline. So the upside for this initiative and this way of thinking is quite dramatic. Because if you think about enterprise solution selling and you do that in all the geos and all the industries, and you really establish a relationship plan with the customers at the C level, that\u2019s quite convincing, you could do a lot. And what we could also do is get customers resonating with this and really lock them into the idea of a future roadmap. So they become a design partner. And that\u2019s really what we want. We don\u2019t want sales, we want partnerships. So if we have design partnerships to go three to five years, we\u2019re buying into the roadmap and we\u2019re doing that giving the customer all the benefits of scale and innovation that they deserve from ServiceNow. And at the same time, we\u2019re investing less calories in selling things and more calories on building relationships that last a lifetime.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add Alex that on that while it\u2019s still small, the current expansion that we\u2019re having with our customers, who are going through this buying, we\u2019re going to pretty significant. So we\u2019re really happy with it.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then just maybe one follow-up for you, Gina, if you look at the guidance on a constant currency basis, can you give us a sense, just, I mean, clearly Q3 is a big federal quarter and everything we\u2019ve heard to gesture federal pipeline is quite robust. Can you give us some puts and takes around the guardrails or the conservatism and the guidance that takes that strong federal pipeline into account?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Great question. We absolutely are expecting another strong federal quarters this year. But if you remember on a quarterly basis, there\u2019s a lot of seasonality built into billing. And so as we shared in the past, there\u2019s a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal invoice timing, and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter of Q3 is at some of our customers are becoming larger. They\u2019ve requested a change in annual semi bill \u2013 the semiannual billing and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year. As we had two large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020, that are now being invoiced sending an annual. So that\u2019s actually resulting in two point headwind to the year-over-year growth. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I talked about the four quarter rolling number and if you look at four quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect the strong federal quarter, we absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new and we are feeling really good about Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance.\nBill McDermott: And Alex, if I could build on Gina\u2019s outstanding commentary, I would just say there\u2019s many big opportunities in the back end of the year, in federal, in particular. And the attending to be large programs, as opposed to smaller point solutions. And again, this is more or less the theme now as we\u2019ve become an enterprise solutions company and you\u2019re seeing business in the area of resiliency, there\u2019s a lot of focused on business continuity now outages of course, and dealing with the COVID scenario, cyber security is on the top of many lists and programs that we\u2019re involved in and vaccine management. Vaccine management is one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And as you can tell, they\u2019ll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process, where our front and center on that. And of course, I\u2019m really proud actually of the way the government is looking at digital transformation. They really are looking at this as a way to help government run like business. And there\u2019s a lot of really smart operators on the technology side that I\u2019ve met in many of the large programs and our team is very humble to have an opportunity to help not only the United States, but many of the governments around the world is really exciting.\nAlex Zukin: Makes total sense. And Gina, this is why we\u2019re all very thankful that you\u2019re now guiding to current RPO, where these issues probably don\u2019t \u2013 are less impactful.\nGina Mastantuono: Exactly. Exactly. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks very much for taking the question. Bill, should we construe the strong Q2 results in your bullish pipeline commentary to mean that you\u2019ve clearly begun to benefit more from the economy reopening. And then also, how do you see that playing out over the back half of the year?\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Gregg. Certainly, I think it\u2019s beginning to show in the results and I have to say, part of my belief is that as the economy opens up even more. That can only benefit ServiceNow even more. We have done a great job and I really do take my hat off to our team and all functions of the company to stay focused on the customer and digital only world is not an easy thing to do. And ServiceNow employees that stood up to the challenge. But now as the economies open up and people are back in the office and there is a hybrid world that we\u2019re all accommodating, I do believe getting our sales professionals and executives in front of other executives is only going to help the story resonate even more. So the important thing I believe is that we all learn something from COVID and we recognize what\u2019s essential in terms of travel and accommodating personal meetings versus what is more adequately handled using tools that are digital and can be scaled even faster. And it\u2019s the combination of those two forces that I think will really lift ServiceNow actually to new heights, Gregg.\nGregg Moskowitz: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Bill. And then just one for Gina, I think your subscription gross margins are a bit lower than they\u2019ve been in awhile. Is there anything that you would call that here?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, the margins we talked about there, we were keeping them flat to our guys that they are impacted versus the prior year a bit. And we talked about this earlier in the year when making increased investment in our data centers and customer support to serve customers impacted by the new data residency regulations, as well as serving our customers who require additional security measures such as IL-5 for our fed customers. So those are the big ticket items that are impacting our margin that was included in our original dive for the year. And we are achieving exactly what we set out to do on both those funds.\nGregg Moskowitz: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia. Your line is open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I want to start off maybe with the new customers, is it clearly seems like there\u2019s strong traction there and your platform is broader than it used to be many years ago. I\u2019m wondering how many of your new customers are coming in off of that outside of your core IT workflows in HR, in customer service management. Are you seeing traction there from new customers or was that mostly a point of expansion from existing customers?\nBill McDermott: That\u2019s a really good question, Arjun. What we\u2019re seeing is, ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world and creative workflows and customer service management and employee experience. And we are built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it\u2019s not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the employee experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that frankly can accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that\u2019s going to be everywhere. And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others. And I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace and yes, new deals beginning with employee experience. The same thing on customer service management. We\u2019re now in a direct-to-consumer digital first world and the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service. And that is our focus and there\u2019s many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us data. And I really want to stress this create a workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you\u2019re going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there, because what\u2019s happening is they have to start with the low-code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying in to a unified platform like ServiceNow, and ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market. And that\u2019s what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. So we\u2019ve seen new deals and creator and customer and employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re very bullish on the company.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add on that really pleased with our new customer growth. We talked about it in the script about five new customers, just this quarter, over $1 million, and that\u2019s across several different industries. And all of those five customers actually purchased five or more products. So cross-platform, it\u2019s quite amazing. And so I still talks about IT certainly continues to be a high percentage of our new logos, but we\u2019re seeing more and more, a high percentage of land with TSM, app engine and HR. So really, really pleased with the progress there.\nBill McDermott: Absolutely.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. That\u2019s great to hear. And one more, if I can follow-up on Gregg\u2019s question about reopening, I\u2019m curious if the delta variant or any impact from that is coming up in your conversations with customers and whether this is something that you\u2019re factoring, if you\u2019re factoring that into guidance at all at this point or if it\u2019s still too early to bake in any impact from impact of verticals on that front?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And certainly first and foremost, our greatest concern is always for the health and wellbeing of our people and our hearts go out to all those affected. And we definitely having conversations with customers, but with that said our business model is extremely resilient and predictable. We have a very robust backlog RPO exiting Q2 at $9.5 billion. And we talked about pipeline, right our pipeline continues to look really strong and our coverage ratio is better than the same time last year. So that\u2019s definitely off getting any potential conversion rates that might come under pressure. So I feel extremely confident in our guide right now. And we\u2019re certainly seeing the acceleration of digital transformation as hybrid environment, continuing to accelerate itself feels very strong about the guide.\nArjun Bhatia: Great. Congrats again.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really nice quarter as well. I want to ask a kind of a higher level question. What are the \u2013 investor debates going on right now is relative strength in the market of back office applications versus front office with most investors thinking that that most of the focal point is on the front office. You guys see both sides of the equation. So Bill, can you give us some indication on sort of whether there\u2019s a relative more strength in the front office and back office or how you\u2019re seeing that market environment right now.\nBill McDermott: That\u2019s a really important question. One of the things that\u2019s really, really interesting Keith is, it\u2019s neither a back nor front office world anymore. It actually is both and that\u2019s the big change in the enterprise. And that\u2019s why the Now Platform is uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers on our ecosystem, because it actually ties the front and the back together. And that\u2019s the big aha, so many enterprise participants and I\u2019ve been in the enterprise for awhile made their success at a being good in functional domains with shrink wrapped software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it and then eco systems evolve on top of that. But what happened, especially in this hybrid work from anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do or die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT for that\u2019s absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance. And it has to serve the business and then the business is pulling at IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. So I think having a great front office employee experience and having a great front office customer service management and a great career workflow is tied to that resilient core. It\u2019s really resonating so big time. And the other thing is, it\u2019s really nice to speak well of all the market participants, because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful. So that Now Platform is really thinking in as the platform for digital business and that\u2019s really what we dreamed of and it\u2019s happening.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And if I think one last one, I think it kind of dovetails what you are talking about in terms of working well with the other market participants. And it\u2019s kind of more of a question on the other side, I\u2019ve always thought of your ITSM solution is kind of the backbone within the IT department, which everybody integrates into. And one of those major integrations has been the observability vendors in the states. I\u2019ve always heard them talk about sort of as not being one of the most requested integrations on their platform, but now you\u2019re going to start competing with these guys. So how do you balance being that good partner as the backbone within IT, but also starting to emerge as more of a competitor and observability?\nBill McDermott: I think it\u2019s very important to acknowledge that it\u2019s not about competing with the other participants in the market. It\u2019s about innovating on the Now Platform and giving the customer as much innovation as we possibly can. So they can conduct their business processes and their workflows on the Now Platform. To the extent, there are functionalities or investments that have been made in other participants in the market. We\u2019re very happy to integrate with them and accentuate that functionality into our Now Workflow. So the customer gets the best of all worlds. I will tell you that there are many customers that absolutely tell us that we want [Technical Difficulty]\nKeith Weiss: \u2026to particular functional areas who intervene it means and that\u2019s it. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Keith. Hey look, the reality is we\u2019re the only born in the cloud so for a company to have eclipsed $5 billion in revenue without large M&A. We\u2019re highly aware of that. But we also aware that this is a very unique culture and this sales \u2013 for engineers is really in a league of its own and we continue to run the playbook again innovation. And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day, when we said we\u2019d be a $15 billion plus revenue company. Having said that, RPA, and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn\u2019t expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also be an open and willing partner for the customers because it\u2019s really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is, they\u2019ve got lots of good points solutions all over the place. And that in effect is the root cause of a lot of the mess that\u2019s been created in these enterprises. And more and more when I talk to leaders of companies and spent quite a bit of time during that this year, they tell me that they\u2019re looking for that control tower, that, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable that workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations, and enable their people to serve their customers. And really that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So I\u2019ll always keep bringing it back to, we can get where we said, we\u2019d go organically. We\u2019re always on our tippy toes, looking at what\u2019s best for our customers and our shareholders. And we always look at that. But right now, the plan is ever steady and there are no plans to acquire in the space that you mentioned.\nKeith Weiss: All right. Many things, Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much for the question too. Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for the question. Bill, last quarter you talked about the EMEA business, I think you said it was on fire and clearly it\u2019s nice to see the uptick in EMEA as a percentage of revenue. Curious how that\u2019s evolved this quarter, obviously there\u2019s kind of some mixed trends over there as it relates to reopening. But just wanted to see what if you\u2019re seeing that momentum carry into Q2 and your thoughts there for the back half of the year.\nBill McDermott: Yes. EMEA is doing fabulous. And one of the big changes that we\u2019ve made in EMEA was obviously the proper leadership, not just that the immediate ahead level, which is now obviously working extremely well and very proud of that, but also in significant countries within EMEA, because as you know, every country in Europe has its own unique culture, its own unique business motions, and you have to be strong with leadership and all of the geographies. And we\u2019re able to attract and retain the very best people in the enterprise software industry. I think that\u2019s one of the root causes of our success. The second would be our C-level relationships. We have upped our game and instead of dealing with only the CIO, which is an incredibly important executive to us. We have also created relationship plans across the C-suite and really enabled the platform strategy for our customers. And I think that\u2019s the big evolution of ServiceNow in EMEA. We\u2019ve become a platform company there as well. So it\u2019s kind of exciting when you consider how talk to Europe has had it with COVID and the travel restriction to do as well as we are. And can you imagine when things do loosen up and open up a little bit, just how big this is going to get in Europe for us. So we\u2019re very excited. The business is going great. And in EMEA, just so, if the head of the first half operating plan, the internal operating plan and that\u2019s a really good sign.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add to there that only did EMEA do well. We had really strong performance across all regions, Americas and APJ as well. So we\u2019re really feeling good from a geography perspective that, that we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders.\nTyler Radke: Great. And just as making a quick follow-up. So I think you talked about Creator workflows, being an 18 in the top 20 deals, which was more than both ITSM and ITOM, but it did a down tick from 20% of net new ACV to 14% this quarter. I was curious if there\u2019s anything to call out there, whether it was just smaller creator deal sizes, or it was just the IPPs was so strong this quarter. Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll take that. So platform had a very strong quarter and you\u2019re right in 17 of our top 20 deals, including one deal over $1 million. Q1, we closed some seven figure, multiple seven figure Creator workflow deals, which were unusually large and more than we typically see in one particular quarter. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a shift queue. In Q2, we really basically went back to a more normalized run rate of the 14%, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing. I know that back in financial Analyst Day in May, we talked about the fact that we expect creative workflows becomes 20% of net new ACV by 2024. And we\u2019re well on our way and are doing extremely well in that trajectory. So we feel really good about the performance. And then Bill, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything on the actual strategy behind.\nBill McDermott: No. I think you did a great Gina. And I think you also acknowledged all of our regional leaders and I like to acknowledge all of our regional leaders along with you, it\u2019s a great thing, and also our leadership executive team here and all the folks in engineering that have worked tirelessly to build the most innovative platform in the world is truly an honor to be associated with these folks. And I\u2019m so bullish on creative workflow. And I truly believe that the new motion in the enterprise, it\u2019s not going to be in a separate endeavors of innovation. It\u2019s going to be the unification of innovation. And the big organizations are going to insist on enterprise coherence and security and business process alignment, and the CEOs of very involved in digital transformation, the CEOs that are out there, some of the greatest leaders I\u2019ve ever seen, and they\u2019re very focused on digital first and they\u2019re not going to let these enterprises do whatever they want to do. So the companies that have true platforms that are acknowledged in the strategy room of the Board of Directors of given companies are going to do very well now. And the ones that are trying to get there, you better have a really great story on how you\u2019re going to take care of all the needs of the enterprise and not just a few needs of a specific silo.\nOperator: And we will be taking one more question from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Just one question from my side, you mentioned the improvement in the hardest hit industries from the pandemic. I\u2019m curious, what are these industries prioritizing in terms of their spend with ServiceNow and how durable do you expect that spending to be moving forward?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, great question. We\u2019re really pleased with the trajectory there and that they are returning to more normalized spending habits. The areas that I can call out most are really around business resilience and how do they make sure that they are extremely well positioned, as we come out of this pandemic to help their employees be more productive in a hybrid world to really help ensure that their operations are as resilient as possible. So that\u2019s throughout our IT, whether it\u2019s ITOM and ITAM together or ITBM as well as risk and security. So really across the board feeling really good about the fact that, that, that\u2019s opening up again.\nBill McDermott: And I would build on Gina\u2019s comments Sterling by also saying that the speed of digital business right now is faster than I think any of us could have even imagined. And they\u2019re all talking seamless customer experience. And when you have to have a seamless customer experience to win, you have to align the value chain across the entire enterprise to earn that customer loyalty. And what you see in a lot of these companies is the middle office operations and just how manual these processes are and just how fractured the data is. So we\u2019re really good in getting the data organized and focused and put into a workflow so you can align the business process and you can be more resilient, but at the same time, you can enable this direct-to-consumer relationship. I mean, when was the last time anyone on this call went into a bank, everything is done on the mobile. Everything is direct-to-consumer. Everything has to happen with a gorgeous, simplified UI. And I think that is really driving so much of the conversations we\u2019re in right now.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: And due to time constraints, that will be our last question. And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25% and the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51 up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year, an incredible performance by our team and exceptional first half. And we have unstoppable momentum and we've reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board. Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3 times faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do or die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind. We are giving customers the innovative solution they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world's biggest challenges [are service now] [(ph), as big as the opportunities, from vaccine management to ESG to the new world of hybrid work. Whatever the challenge work flows with ServiceNow. We've created a new market. One that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today's digital business demands. The Now platform, the platform of platforms delivers workflow automation, where the consumers raise user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across the enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world. For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges and maintaining on target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and they are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage this complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain. It's just one example of the power of the Now platform. I'd like to share an overview of our success of core ServiceNow's portfolio. Let's begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. Our AI powered service operations is resonating big time with customers. We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They're working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we're honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts and it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience. With employee workflows we make work better by driving outstanding employee experience that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere, while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now platform provides employees a system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving, and many more moments that matter for people, employee workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. [Asahi] (ph) for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. With customer workflows, we're creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that we define customer operations for greatest speed, agility, transparency, and convenience all while working with existing systems. Customer workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals with four deals over $1 million. We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow's telecommunications solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process enabling a 360 degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure creating a seamless connected experience for DT's employees and customers. With creative workflows, we're accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences. IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than three months using ServiceNow's low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2 creative workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow's creative workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms. These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now buying program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility all while improving business impact, continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now buying program with Deloitte, who will take advantage of our old products suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients, while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business. Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft teams, regardless of the employee's location in the hybrid work environment. In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team passion to solving the world's greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business. In our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It's been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It's a privilege to help the world reopen and safely returned to the workplace. We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society's biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. We are better than we were yesterday not as good as will be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions. But first, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you. Sure. Thank you very much, Raimo, for the question. First, I'd like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership, as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company, because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever all the systems even exist in the company, I couldn't pick out of a lineup, because only thing we look at as Now, ServiceNow. And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that's moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust. And it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year as is our engineering leader and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina's value and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart, because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information. It's very, very strong. In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT is the stronghold on so many things now, because if you want to give the employees a great experience that you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT business around creating these new workflows, which is necessary, because there's not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required. Everybody can agree on the Now platform and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes. Yes, I really like to thank Ben and his team for their trust in ServiceNow, and Pablo and CJ and our great engineering team for the work that they're doing together. What we think is that ServiceNow has proven capabilities combined with Lightstep's observability technology will really help organizations seamlessly connect, because that's the big deal, seamlessly connect the insights in that data form the necessary patterns in that data. And then action them into the workflow which enables people process and technology to truly deliver great experiences for the customers and the employees and I think what differentiates us uniquely is this is one pane of glass. It's one user experience, and it is not just the developer operations, you'll also see business executives align on this as well. And to us that's going to really help organization seamlessly connect their digital experiences across the enterprise. Again, the platform I can't stress this enough, the digital platform, the Now platform is the glue that's tying it all together. Thank you. Yes, absolutely Matt. The main thing is speed, right. We're in a market that is very robust. Digital transformation is really hot and we are that signature brand. So the more quickly we can evolve the upgrade process and the net new deals to get customers live, that's really what it's all about. And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal. So when you think about the Now buying program, we're looking at larger rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process as you rightly point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation, our innovators, they're just so amazing here. Every time you turn around and the next release is a new breakthrough, I just can't thank them enough. ITSM Pro and enterprise are doing terrific, and this is enabling customers to try things as well. And exchange or adopt products at their will, and it's giving them a forward look at where we're going with our roadmaps. And when they see the innovation powered ServiceNow that actually buys them in very quickly. And finally, I would just like to say, we've done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company, but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure that the customer understands the value they realized. So as they step in to bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success support and value, and they can carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say, this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you; I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today, where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems that they standardized on the Now platform. So it's just really good for the customer and it's good for our folks too to get the customer to value fast. Thank you, Matt. Well, thank you very much Kash. And thank you for all the things that you saw in the Now platform and our leadership in the market, I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos. So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers. Because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent, they want to leverage other technologies that they've already invested in, of course, we're so accommodating to that, because our great engineers have built all out of the box integrations to the biggest systems in the world. So it's kind of started with the core and now it's moving across the enterprise with great speed and all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans and they're all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry is amazing. So I would just like to give you a feel for this Kash by just saying, like, we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation core as we expand the perimeter to employee and customer service management and now creator our great sales leadership sees the opportunity and they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline. And we're trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model. And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that's a high class situation, because most companies are complaining about the [war on] (ph) talent and they're actually suffering because they don't have enough talented people to do the job. We're only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow and the hardest part our recruiting team's doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes. So I think it's great that we're actually hiring ahead. We see a great hockey stick in the pipeline and I have tremendous confidence in our sales leadership all over the world. Thank you, Kash. Thank you very much, Alex. I mean, the good news is, it's early \u2013 it's a very, very small part of our results and a very, very small part of our pipeline. So the upside for this initiative and this way of thinking is quite dramatic. Because if you think about enterprise solution selling and you do that in all the geos and all the industries, and you really establish a relationship plan with the customers at the C level, that's quite convincing, you could do a lot. And what we could also do is get customers resonating with this and really lock them into the idea of a future roadmap. So they become a design partner. And that's really what we want. We don't want sales, we want partnerships. So if we have design partnerships to go three to five years, we're buying into the roadmap and we're doing that giving the customer all the benefits of scale and innovation that they deserve from ServiceNow. And at the same time, we're investing less calories in selling things and more calories on building relationships that last a lifetime. And Alex, if I could build on Gina's outstanding commentary, I would just say there's many big opportunities in the back end of the year, in federal, in particular. And the attending to be large programs, as opposed to smaller point solutions. And again, this is more or less the theme now as we've become an enterprise solutions company and you're seeing business in the area of resiliency, there's a lot of focused on business continuity now outages of course, and dealing with the COVID scenario, cyber security is on the top of many lists and programs that we're involved in and vaccine management. Vaccine management is one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces. And as you can tell, they'll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process, where our front and center on that. And of course, I'm really proud actually of the way the government is looking at digital transformation. They really are looking at this as a way to help government run like business. And there's a lot of really smart operators on the technology side that I've met in many of the large programs and our team is very humble to have an opportunity to help not only the United States, but many of the governments around the world is really exciting. Thank you very much, Gregg. Certainly, I think it's beginning to show in the results and I have to say, part of my belief is that as the economy opens up even more. That can only benefit ServiceNow even more. We have done a great job and I really do take my hat off to our team and all functions of the company to stay focused on the customer and digital only world is not an easy thing to do. And ServiceNow employees that stood up to the challenge. But now as the economies open up and people are back in the office and there is a hybrid world that we're all accommodating, I do believe getting our sales professionals and executives in front of other executives is only going to help the story resonate even more. So the important thing I believe is that we all learn something from COVID and we recognize what's essential in terms of travel and accommodating personal meetings versus what is more adequately handled using tools that are digital and can be scaled even faster. And it's the combination of those two forces that I think will really lift ServiceNow actually to new heights, Gregg. That's a really good question, Arjun. What we're seeing is, ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world and creative workflows and customer service management and employee experience. And we are built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it's not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the employee experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that frankly can accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that's going to be everywhere. And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others. And I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace and yes, new deals beginning with employee experience. The same thing on customer service management. We're now in a direct-to-consumer digital first world and the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service. And that is our focus and there's many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us data. And I really want to stress this create a workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you're going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there, because what's happening is they have to start with the low-code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying in to a unified platform like ServiceNow, and ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market. And that's what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. So we've seen new deals and creator and customer and employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier. And it's one of the reasons why we're very bullish on the company. Absolutely. Thank you. That's a really important question. One of the things that's really, really interesting Keith is, it's neither a back nor front office world anymore. It actually is both and that's the big change in the enterprise. And that's why the Now Platform is uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers on our ecosystem, because it actually ties the front and the back together. And that's the big aha, so many enterprise participants and I've been in the enterprise for awhile made their success at a being good in functional domains with shrink wrapped software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it and then eco systems evolve on top of that. But what happened, especially in this hybrid work from anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do or die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT for that's absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance. And it has to serve the business and then the business is pulling at IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress. So I think having a great front office employee experience and having a great front office customer service management and a great career workflow is tied to that resilient core. It's really resonating so big time. And the other thing is, it's really nice to speak well of all the market participants, because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful. So that Now Platform is really thinking in as the platform for digital business and that's really what we dreamed of and it's happening. I think it's very important to acknowledge that it's not about competing with the other participants in the market. It's about innovating on the Now Platform and giving the customer as much innovation as we possibly can. So they can conduct their business processes and their workflows on the Now Platform. To the extent, there are functionalities or investments that have been made in other participants in the market. We're very happy to integrate with them and accentuate that functionality into our Now Workflow. So the customer gets the best of all worlds. I will tell you that there are many customers that absolutely tell us that we want [Technical Difficulty] Thank you very much for the question, Keith. Hey look, the reality is we're the only born in the cloud so for a company to have eclipsed $5 billion in revenue without large M&A. We're highly aware of that. But we also aware that this is a very unique culture and this sales \u2013 for engineers is really in a league of its own and we continue to run the playbook again innovation. And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day, when we said we'd be a $15 billion plus revenue company. Having said that, RPA, and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn't expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also be an open and willing partner for the customers because it's really about solving their problems. And the biggest thing I hear from them is, they've got lots of good points solutions all over the place. And that in effect is the root cause of a lot of the mess that's been created in these enterprises. And more and more when I talk to leaders of companies and spent quite a bit of time during that this year, they tell me that they're looking for that control tower, that, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable that workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations, and enable their people to serve their customers. And really that's what we're doing. So I'll always keep bringing it back to, we can get where we said, we'd go organically. We're always on our tippy toes, looking at what's best for our customers and our shareholders. And we always look at that. But right now, the plan is ever steady and there are no plans to acquire in the space that you mentioned. Thank you very much for the question too. Thank you, Keith. Yes. EMEA is doing fabulous. And one of the big changes that we've made in EMEA was obviously the proper leadership, not just that the immediate ahead level, which is now obviously working extremely well and very proud of that, but also in significant countries within EMEA, because as you know, every country in Europe has its own unique culture, its own unique business motions, and you have to be strong with leadership and all of the geographies. And we're able to attract and retain the very best people in the enterprise software industry. I think that's one of the root causes of our success. The second would be our C-level relationships. We have upped our game and instead of dealing with only the CIO, which is an incredibly important executive to us. We have also created relationship plans across the C-suite and really enabled the platform strategy for our customers. And I think that's the big evolution of ServiceNow in EMEA. We've become a platform company there as well. So it's kind of exciting when you consider how talk to Europe has had it with COVID and the travel restriction to do as well as we are. And can you imagine when things do loosen up and open up a little bit, just how big this is going to get in Europe for us. So we're very excited. The business is going great. And in EMEA, just so, if the head of the first half operating plan, the internal operating plan and that's a really good sign. No. I think you did a great Gina. And I think you also acknowledged all of our regional leaders and I like to acknowledge all of our regional leaders along with you, it's a great thing, and also our leadership executive team here and all the folks in engineering that have worked tirelessly to build the most innovative platform in the world is truly an honor to be associated with these folks. And I'm so bullish on creative workflow. And I truly believe that the new motion in the enterprise, it's not going to be in a separate endeavors of innovation. It's going to be the unification of innovation. And the big organizations are going to insist on enterprise coherence and security and business process alignment, and the CEOs of very involved in digital transformation, the CEOs that are out there, some of the greatest leaders I've ever seen, and they're very focused on digital first and they're not going to let these enterprises do whatever they want to do. So the companies that have true platforms that are acknowledged in the strategy room of the Board of Directors of given companies are going to do very well now. And the ones that are trying to get there, you better have a really great story on how you're going to take care of all the needs of the enterprise and not just a few needs of a specific silo. And I would build on Gina's comments Sterling by also saying that the speed of digital business right now is faster than I think any of us could have even imagined. And they're all talking seamless customer experience. And when you have to have a seamless customer experience to win, you have to align the value chain across the entire enterprise to earn that customer loyalty. And what you see in a lot of these companies is the middle office operations and just how manual these processes are and just how fractured the data is. So we're really good in getting the data organized and focused and put into a workflow so you can align the business process and you can be more resilient, but at the same time, you can enable this direct-to-consumer relationship. I mean, when was the last time anyone on this call went into a bank, everything is done on the mobile. Everything is direct-to-consumer. Everything has to happen with a gorgeous, simplified UI. And I think that is really driving so much of the conversations we're in right now. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metric. The team demonstrated exceptional execution and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. Q2 subscription revenues was $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of a 450 basis points tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligation or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a $4.3 billion versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year. Q2 subscription billing to $1.328 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth by $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance, FX and duration where 500 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. We saw growth across all our industry categories, financial services and manufacturing are particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity. Industry is impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. The Now platform remains a mission critical part of our customer's operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness that our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land and expand growth strategy. This was evident that the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers payments over $1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we close 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We're also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year. Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio, instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. Turning to profitability, operating margin was 25%, three points above our guidance driven by the strong revenue beat G&A cost saving and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. And we've heard from Bill, the macro trends starting digital transformation or significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May, included two amazing weeks of keynote, panels and discussion that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics. This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and healthcare industry product and showcase the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflow. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account without 45% year-over-year. Together, the macro tailwind and interest generated from knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We're raising our subscription revenues outlook by $73 million at the midpoint point to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind. We are raising our subscription billings outlets by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes in that tailwind and FX duration, 200 basis points. We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85% and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top-line growth, more efficient marketing spend and stayed in some continued lower G&A expenses related to COVID. We are raising our full year of 2021 free cash margin by one point from 30% to 31%. I've note that from a seasonality perspective, we're expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect subscription billing between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes the net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings in the four quarter rolling basis, we'll help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms. On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity. ServiceNow is a digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business and we are well on our way to becoming $15 billion revenue company. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Yes. So I talked about net new ACV accelerating in 2021 versus 2020. And we have definitely seen that happening across the board and with our strong beat in Q2 and our raise in the back-half the acceleration that we're seeing is actually greater than initially anticipated. And I would just add Alex that on that while it's still small, the current expansion that we're having with our customers, who are going through this buying, we're going to pretty significant. So we're really happy with it. Yes. Great question. We absolutely are expecting another strong federal quarters this year. But if you remember on a quarterly basis, there's a lot of seasonality built into billing. And so as we shared in the past, there's a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal invoice timing, and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter of Q3 is at some of our customers are becoming larger. They've requested a change in annual semi bill \u2013 the semiannual billing and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year. As we had two large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020, that are now being invoiced sending an annual. So that's actually resulting in two point headwind to the year-over-year growth. It's one of the reasons why I talked about the four quarter rolling number and if you look at four quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect the strong federal quarter, we absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new and we are feeling really good about Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance. Exactly. Exactly. Thank you. Yes, the margins we talked about there, we were keeping them flat to our guys that they are impacted versus the prior year a bit. And we talked about this earlier in the year when making increased investment in our data centers and customer support to serve customers impacted by the new data residency regulations, as well as serving our customers who require additional security measures such as IL-5 for our fed customers. So those are the big ticket items that are impacting our margin that was included in our original dive for the year. And we are achieving exactly what we set out to do on both those funds. And I would just add on that really pleased with our new customer growth. We talked about it in the script about five new customers, just this quarter, over $1 million, and that's across several different industries. And all of those five customers actually purchased five or more products. So cross-platform, it's quite amazing. And so I still talks about IT certainly continues to be a high percentage of our new logos, but we're seeing more and more, a high percentage of land with TSM, app engine and HR. So really, really pleased with the progress there. Yes. Yes. It's a great question. And certainly first and foremost, our greatest concern is always for the health and wellbeing of our people and our hearts go out to all those affected. And we definitely having conversations with customers, but with that said our business model is extremely resilient and predictable. We have a very robust backlog RPO exiting Q2 at $9.5 billion. And we talked about pipeline, right our pipeline continues to look really strong and our coverage ratio is better than the same time last year. So that's definitely off getting any potential conversion rates that might come under pressure. So I feel extremely confident in our guide right now. And we're certainly seeing the acceleration of digital transformation as hybrid environment, continuing to accelerate itself feels very strong about the guide. And I would just add to there that only did EMEA do well. We had really strong performance across all regions, Americas and APJ as well. So we're really feeling good from a geography perspective that, that we're hitting on all cylinders. Yes. Yes. I'll take that. So platform had a very strong quarter and you're right in 17 of our top 20 deals, including one deal over $1 million. Q1, we closed some seven figure, multiple seven figure Creator workflow deals, which were unusually large and more than we typically see in one particular quarter. And so that's why you're seeing a little bit of a shift queue. In Q2, we really basically went back to a more normalized run rate of the 14%, which is consistent with what we've been seeing. I know that back in financial Analyst Day in May, we talked about the fact that we expect creative workflows becomes 20% of net new ACV by 2024. And we're well on our way and are doing extremely well in that trajectory. So we feel really good about the performance. And then Bill, I don't know if you want to add anything on the actual strategy behind. Yes, great question. We're really pleased with the trajectory there and that they are returning to more normalized spending habits. The areas that I can call out most are really around business resilience and how do they make sure that they are extremely well positioned, as we come out of this pandemic to help their employees be more productive in a hybrid world to really help ensure that their operations are as resilient as possible. So that's throughout our IT, whether it's ITOM and ITAM together or ITBM as well as risk and security. So really across the board feeling really good about the fact that, that, that's opening up again."

Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. I hope everyone remains healthy and safe, and you and your loved ones are benefiting from broader vaccine availability. ServiceNow remains grateful to be in such a strong position to help support our families, communities and customers. We started 2021 with another outstanding quarter, delivering a perfect balance of growth and profitability. Our team is executing, maintaining a swift pace towards our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. In Q1, we grew subscription revenue 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance. We delivered strong profitability with operating margin over 27%, and we increased free cash flow margin 7 points year-over-year to 46%. Our significant Q1 beat across the Board represents the passion our culture has for innovating and our relentless focus on the customer. We are ideally positioned to deliver what our customers need. In the past year, the transformation of work has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and experiences. As a result, digital investments are an all-time high and will total more than $7.8 trillion by 2024 according to IDC. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for digital transformation across the enterprise. We have expanded the boundaries from IT to employee, customer and now creator workflows for citizen developers. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders, and so are we. Our culture was born for this moment. Our team of 14,000 colleagues are exponential thinkers. This is how we continuously bring innovation to everything we do. In just the past 18 months, we have more than doubled the features and functionality of our platform for our customers. We're at the epicenter of the workflow revolution. Our purpose has never been more relevant. We are making the world of work, work better for people. We are helping our customers drink bit and to build their digital bridge to the future. Xerox, for example, is working with ServiceNow to transform the services industry, leveraging our field service management, their technicians will use machine learning to proactively solve customer problems. They're using virtual and augmented reality tools to resolve their customers' issues via desktop, mobile and smart glass devices. In this bold mill world is as if their agents are there in person. Digital transformation is about creating great employee and customer experiences. In an increasingly distributed hybrid workforce, companies need to create frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. This requires seamless cross enterprise workflows, linking systems, silos, departments and processes, only the Now platform can do this with native integrations. The platform of platforms, the power of one, one data model, one architecture, one enterprise solution to workflow every business challenge. This is what ServiceNow delivers. We are the only ones doing what we do, the way we do it. Strong demand for ServiceNow is evident in our results, high growth, organically driven at mass scale, while aggressively investing in future growth and delivering significant profitability. An amazing business model and a true testament to the power of the Now platform. Our teams keep innovating. We're proud that Qu\u00e9bec, our latest platform release delivered 1,700 new customer capabilities, breakthrough innovations like predictive AI operations, AI search and virtual agents that enhance every experience, to name a few. ServiceNow is helping customers move to the cloud and invent new business models. The past year has demonstrated that giving people the right productivity tools is critical to success, especially in distributed work environments. It's why organizations like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, Logitech, city of Los Angeles and Discover are using the Now platform. Discover, in fact, is fully utilizing the Now platform's ease of upgrade, participating in the early adopter program for our Qu\u00e9bec release. Now Discover is able to focus on timely availability, and adoption of new functionality, the Now platform is the gold standard for time to value. By the end of 2021, Forrester Research predicts that 75% of development shops will use low-code platforms. With Qu\u00e9bec, we are delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of the engineering organization and into the hands of citizen developers. Employees without software expertise who need to quickly create workflow applications. We're seeing strong response. The National Cancer Institute at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is a great example. NCI has established a digital service center around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. In just 10 days, NCI leverage ServiceNow to build a new application for an online portal to collect and track specimens from COVID-19 patients. ServiceNow's low-code app is helping NCI staff support the global research community in understanding how genetic factors contribute to the severity of COVID-19 cases. We also introduced process and workforce optimization capabilities in our new enterprise SKUs. This brings even more intelligence to our customers, allowing them to be more agile. We're putting new AI capabilities in the hands of our customers, so they can enhance productivity while spending more time on human creativity. With our recent acquisition of Intellibot, ServiceNow will have an unmatched intelligent workflow automation solution with RPA, AI, machine learning and process mining native to the Now platform. You'll hear more about this from our Chief Product and Engineering Officer, CJ Desai, at our upcoming Investor Day. Please be there. Now let's look more closely at Q1 performance highlights across our portfolio. Our better together solutions continue to drive more multi-product deals. Our core IT workflows remain strong. ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals. Our AI and ML capabilities embedded with our pro SKU, continue to resonate with customers. ITOM had a strong quarter and was in 13 of the top 20 deals. EMEA was especially strong. We're hitting a new Gear with CEO engagement. We're seeing more demand across industries, including financial services as EU banking regulations require companies to have full visibility into their assets while also managing risk. HSBC, for example, chose ServiceNow in a multiyear partnership as their workflow partner of choice to help them digitize at scale. Supporting HSBC's employees, ServiceNow will deliver the technologies needed to simplify their architectural landscape. This creates efficiencies, better controls and compliance. Australia and New Zealand Banking group also chose the ServiceNow platform to consolidate, simplify its IT systems and streamline operations to improve the employee experience. The Now platform gives them the advantage of a fully integrated view of technology and risk. We continue to see strength in our customer workflows. Our investment in the telco vertical are gaining traction daily and it's materializing in wins across the globe. Lumen Technologies, a leading telecommunications company is transforming its customer care, and assurance function with ServiceNow customer workflows. They will use the Now platform to deliver best-in-class customer experiences across their networking, cloud and security solutions. Telia, a leading multinational telecommunications company, selected ServiceNow to transform service operations, connecting network operations, employees and customers around the world. Creating workflows, our platform business was in 19 of our top 20 deals. Three of our top 10 app engine wins came from APJ where we are seeing increased awareness of ServiceNow and is continuing to drive demand. A large global manufacturing company in Japan is planning to use our app engine to automate manual processes take out cost and risk associated with migrating on-premise applications to the cloud. This will be a movement in Japan. In the US, the Now platform is at the heart of the city of Los Angeles' digital transformation, helping to provide reliable access to essential services for its four million citizens. The city is expanding its use of digital technology to provide immediate access services, which enables citizens to get the assistance they deserve. Employee workflows were included in eight of our top 20 deals. Zalando is a leading online platform for fashion and lifestyle, connecting customers, brands and partners. As part of their HR transformation, they will implement a central employee services portal using ServiceNow's employee workflows. Zalando sees this as a critical component in supporting their growth, and improving their employee experiences. Employee and workplace safety are top of mind for our customers. We are the only company with a complete suite of applications to meet these critical needs. Since the start of the pandemic, ServiceNow has been at the forefront of solving unprecedented challenges. We saw the meet early and acted quickly. First, our emergency response apps, then our safe workplace apps and now with vaccine administration management, we leverage the speed and agility of the Now platform and the incredible talent of our product team to innovate fast, deliver market-leading solutions to support our customers and help keep them safe. You see, organization trap in the last mile of vaccine management as they lack the processes and infrastructure needed to vaccinate people quickly. This is the workflow challenge of our time. To address these challenges, organizations are using the Now platform as their vaccine management manage center. Our workflows are connected organization's existing technology infrastructure to help orchestrate the critical elements of the vaccine management process, including distributing administering and monitoring vaccines. The Minnesota children's hospital implemented our vaccine administration management in five days, so they can stay focused on their number one priority, caring for children. The hospital is using ServiceNow virtual assistant to answer questions and scheduled patient vaccinations. They are leveraging inventory tracking and scheduling to ensure appointments, staffing levels and vaccines are all in sync. Germany's largest state, North Ryan Westfalia, is using ServiceNow to support vaccinations for millions of people. Within two hours of the portal going live, 120,000 people have registered and received an appointment. ServiceNow ended Q1 working with over 100 organizations and governments globally to help vaccinate people at scale. We are supporting the delivery and management of millions of vaccines globally. We will continue to do more. The workflow revolution is all about helping people. We are humbled to be helping so many people around the world manage this workflow challenge. In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong momentum. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. From the beginning of this pandemic, we have focused on taking care of our people and taking care of our customers. That's why we're so grateful to be named to the Fortune 100 Best places to work list for the first time.

We are well on our way to $10 billion and beyond, and we are striving with all we have to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenue, subscription billings and cRPO guidance and those top line beats carried through to a very robust operating margin and strong free cash flow. Q1 subscription revenues were $1.293 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 4-point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.8 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth, putting us well on our way towards our $10 billion revenue target. Current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion representing 33% year-over-year growth and 100 basis points beat versus our guidance. Notably, we delivered that beat with 100 basis points less of an FX tailwind. Due to the weaker euro, currency contributed four points instead of our original outlook for a 5-point tailwind. Q1 subscription billings were $1.365 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth and a $3 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 4-point tailwind year-over-year. As Bill mentioned, we saw particular strength in EMEA as investments made in 2020 are gaining traction. In Q1, the region closed one of its largest deals ever, helping to drive very strong year-over-year net new ACV growth. We're also seeing improving trends in APJ, where we were in two of the top three platform deals in the quarter. We continue to see the secular tailwinds driven by the intersection of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation. Every C-suite leader wants to create great experiences for their employees and their customers, and ServiceNow is delivering. The Now platform offers the speed flexibility and innovation companies needs. The sustained strength of our top line growth is the result of consistent execution from across the organization as we address these opportunities. From our engineers who continue to drive leading edge innovation to the sales and customer success teams who partner with our customers to ensure we're delivering value and everyone else in between that helped to deliver great experiences. It's been a tremendous team effort. Our renewal rate remains strong at 97% as the Now platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We closed 37 deals greater than one million ACV in the quarter, including seven net new customers. Our focus on selling comprehensive solutions instead of point products continue to drive more multi-product fields as 17 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. We now have 1,146 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 23% year-over-year, and the number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 50% year-over-year. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 27%, up 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong top line outperformance and the timing of some spend that will shift into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 46%, up 700 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong collections and lower T&E. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in our business. The industry is highly affected by COVID that we outlined earlier last year, which represent about 20% of our business, remains resilient in Q1. We closed several 7-figure deals in these verticals, and renewal rates were ahead of the company average. However, we did continue to see some headwinds in severely impacted industries such as airlines. Regardless of the industry, in an increasingly distributed and hybrid workforce, companies need to create consistent and frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing as companies must reinvest themselves for the new economy. ServiceNow is the strategic authority in digital transformation, and we're committed to helping our customers succeed in that journey. These strong secular tailwinds paired with the strength and agility of the Now platform positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Pipeline generation has remained robust globally, even ahead of our Knowledge 2021 event, which is a big driver, particularly for the Americas. It is helping to drive the net new ACV acceleration in our business this year. Enterprises around the world are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. Now let's turn to guidance. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.29 billion and $1.295 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth, including a 300 basis point FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including a 250 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.25 billion and $1.255 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 300 basis points. We expect an operating margin of 21.5%, which includes $15 million of sales and marketing spend that shifted out of Q1 and into Q2, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we're raising our top line growth guidance on a constant currency basis. We are increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription revenue expectations by $32 million based on the strong trends we saw in Q1. However, a weaker euro resulted in a $59 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription revenues between $5.455 billion and $5.47 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth. This includes a 200 basis point FX tailwind. Similarly, we're increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription billings expectation by $50 million on a constant currency basis. However, the weaker euro resulted in a $68 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription billings between $6.19 billion and $6.205 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. This includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 150 basis points. In terms of quarterly seasonality, we're continuing to see a shift of Q2 and Q3 subscription billings into Q4. We now expect about 21% of our total subscription billings to be in Q3 and 37% to be in Q4. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 85% and operating margin of 23.5%. Finally, we expect recapture margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. You'll hear more about our strategy and long-term opportunity at our upcoming Investor Day on May 10, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. In addition to making work, work better for people, we're also committed to making the world work better as well. This week, we unveiled our first ever global impact report. At our Investor Day, I'm excited to be able to share ServiceNow's global impact strategy with you. In conclusion, ServiceNow is leading this once in a generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. We are focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. We have the platform businesses need and where the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Customers are using the Now platform to create new workflows for new value chains, to improve experiences across silo systems and functions to reduce friction in people's daily lives, and it's showing in our financial results. I'm very excited about the future in front of us. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for helping to make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best places to work. ServiceNow's greatest strength is its people, and you all continue to make us ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this team. And with that, I'll open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you, guys, for taking the question and nice to see the really strong start to the year. I think there's a question for Bill. I think one of the most notable kind of KPIs that we saw is that pickup in the platform business going to 20% of the new ACV, up from 15% just last quarter. That seems to be a pretty big pickup. Can you talk to us - give us a little bit of color in terms of what's enabling those bigger, more strategic platform sales? Was there any processes you put into place with the sales force? Or is it the new partnerships? Or give us some kind of idea of kind of how that picked up so -- is so much in the results this quarter?\nWilliam McDermott: Yes, absolutely. I'd be happy to, Keith. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is we've done all of those things. With Qu\u00e9bec, we're delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of just the engineering organization and really into the hands of the citizen developers. So as you know, with digital transformation is a whole move to modernized apps, and this is really tying engineering and business together, and we're seeing a greater market awareness for ServiceNow's digital transformation enablement to automate manual processes within organizations. And we have a focus in this company on being the platform of all platforms, which means, we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So lots of folks integrate into the Now platform. And our low-code, no-code app development to create new workflows that deliver great experiences is really taking off. And I gave a couple of examples in our prepared remarks, one such example is a National Cancer Institute. So if you think about what they're doing at NCI, they established a digital service center of excellence, and they've done that around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. And when you think about time to value, it's just 10 days, they were up and running with an online portal to collect and track specimens of COVID-19 patients. So we think that this is going to be a runaway success story for the company. And when you look at the year-on-year growth here and you look at the pipeline, we are extremely bullish on this business.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. That\u2019s helpful.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: If I could just ask you about the seasonality in subscription billings this year, maybe sort of a two parter. In terms of 2Q, it looks like your constant currency billings guide of 20%, that's about a 5-point step down from what you did in Q1, yet the 2Q compare, I think, is reasonably easy, given that was a tough quarter for everybody in software in the year ago period. And then in terms of the full-year billings guide, it looks like the constant currency guide is about 23% at the midpoint. Just to clarify, was it about 22% before? So you've, in fact, upped it by a percentage point or so, just to clarify? Thank you so much.\nGina Mastantuono: Sure. So I'll take the first question on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1. So first off, you can see in our IR deck that in Q1, we had $11 million in multi-year billings that we don't expect to occur in Q2. So that's part of the deceleration. As well, we talked about timing, and we've talked about this in the past and why billings is not the best metric, right, because if customers are co terming during the contract period, they often renew early, which changes the timing of renewals and really impact billings. And so one of the reasons why billings is not the greatest of metrics and why we are pointing to and giving guidance now for cRPO of 30% in Q2. What I would say is that we are, in fact, seeing a reacceleration of net new ACV in Q2, given the Q2 comp from last year. It's just that there is a lot of noise in billings. And so I just continue to really stress that we should be looking more at cRPO. And then for the full-year, it's about 28% normalized because remember, last year, we had the pull forward of $80 million of billings out of Q1 of 2021 and into Q4. And so the full-year guide, we have increased it by almost the full Q1 be that you're seeing.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it, okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: A very welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe first on just the pipeline and the visibility to Bill. I'd love to just get a sense for how you're thinking about kind of the large strategic deals? I think there's a fear that last year, it was a time to really go and sell into the base and that there's not a lot of incremental monetization opportunity available in some of the large customers, but it does seem we're at least picking up in our checks, that couldn't be further from the truth and that there's a lot more strategic opportunity available. So maybe just first, I'd love to hear kind of your take on that, Bill. And then I've got a quick follow-up for Gina.\nWilliam McDermott: Sure. Absolutely, Alex. First of all, when you look at the pipeline in my prepared remarks, I was very careful to point out that it's never been better than it is right now. And in fact, it's outstanding. And has a couple of driving forces here. One, if you look at EMEA as a theater, the EMEA business is smoking hot. And you saw 80% year-on-year growth in the first quarter out of EMEA. So let that be the first indicator that the brand is now alive and - we are operating extremely well through the Rolodex of EMEA and the CEOs across various industries and various mission-critical geographies are adopting us as the workflow standard. Continue to believe in EMEA as a great wellspring of growth to ServiceNow, and that was a big one for us to get really rolling. The other piece is APJ. We're seeing now outstanding growth out of APJ, and I would say the same is true for the brand. Now we're well known. We're on fire in Japan. As you know, Japan is an on-premise market and needs to move to the cloud. The workflow revolution is one great way to get them going in the cloud. I gave an example of that in my prepared remarks. We're also expecting better things that was with the leadership adjustment that we've made. We see South Korea doing extremely well. So I want you to believe in APJ is yet another well spring of growth that can go higher and higher with ServiceNow. We've always been strong in the Americas. The Americas had an extraordinary Q4, as you know, and they'll kick back into their normal growth rates at higher and be on course with where we wanted them to be at the end of Q2. So you add all that up in the geographic theaters and the business is in great shape. The other thing we've done is really focused on some breakthrough industries, financial services and telecommunications quickly come to mind, where once we get rolling, the Bowling alley effect takes effect very, very quickly here. And keep in mind, we're now in a global economy. That is shifting quickly to lights back on. Last year, GDP was down substantially in the global economy, yet digital transformation spend was up. This year as the economy comes back, they're not slowing down digital transformation spend, actually, it's also going up, but the economy is waking up. So what's gorgeous about this for us is we now have the CRM techniques of digital selling, combine it with the direct selling that always worked well. And some of the techniques that we've enabled also on inside selling and how we've taken the whole marketing value chain from the brand and communications to field marketing, industry specialization product marketing and then all the resources in the field to basically take that industry specific, value-driven story to the customer, and we've aligned that with our services organization, and an expansive ecosystem with all the big partners betting long on ServiceNow, setting up global practices with ServiceNow. So Alex, I've been in this business for 20 years. I've never seen an opportunity like this in my career, and I actually think we're just getting started.\nAlex Zukin: That's awesome. Thank you, Bill for that. And then maybe just a follow-up for Gina. So as we think about moving our forward-looking indicators to current RPO and RPO. I guess is it - can you maybe remind us of - are there any kind of quirks or seasonality or things we should keep in mind? Because I think some people are going to do change in RPO, which is a little bit harder when there's decimal places, quite frankly, to do it from. But anything we should keep in mind, you're guiding to that 30%. There's a little bit of FX tailwind there. Anything we should think about there?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I mean the RPO is definitely a better guide, and there's less noise in it than billings, but there is noise. There's no perfect forward indicator for you. And so if you think about contracted upsells, for example, on the timing of renewals, that could impact cRPO. Additionally, self-hosted deals could potentially impact the RPO vis-\u00e0-vis revenue growth. So there's no one perfect indicator, but cRPO is definitely a stronger indicator with less noise. So we will continue to guide one quarter out, and we'll continue to stress that. It has less noise and less confusion in it than the billings metric.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Thanks, guys. Congrats.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Good to see the strong start of the year as well. Maybe on the federal side, just with the change in administration, I'm curious if there's been any change in either the demand environment there? Or if there's been a change in maybe the linearity of how we should think about federal and for that matter, state and local government deals this year as well? And then I have one follow-up.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Thanks, Samad. It's actually very obvious that with a change in administration, everybody has to get their offices and get settled in place and budgets have to be allocated and so on. So we see the light turning on the business model at the federal level very strongly in Q2. And we expected that all along. So it makes up about 10% of our business now. So it's a big part of our business, and the pipeline is absolutely swelling, and it's swelling because of the change in administration. But the administration, as you know, is very focused on digital transformation because it's really the only way to run a much more refined, low cost, high delivery process for the constituents to put in office. So everybody is highly aware of that. And we do fantastic, as you know, in federal. And in fact, Homeland security, many other departments have chosen us a vaccine management just as one thing to give you. And state and local, we're doing really good and again, a groundswell of opportunity there. And I do believe as we go through Q2 and into Q3 and Q4, the deals will just get larger and the business will come in stronger as we go. We're doing great in federal, state and local.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very helpful. And then maybe, Gina, just as a follow-up for you. On the comment around the net new ACV accelerating, could you maybe help us understand -- bifurcate that from new ACV from new customers to ServiceNow versus new ACV from existing customers and how -- if either both of those are accelerating or just maybe how the timeline there looks?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I would say that we were really pleased with new logo growth in Q1. We saw strong growth in our new logos and seven new customers greater than $1 million across several verticals, right, pharmaceutical, insurance, e-commerce, just to name a few. And most of these deals actually had 4-plus products. And so we are continuing to see good traction in the new logos and obviously existing as well. And so we saw -- we're not going to give you numbers, but I wanted to make sure, again, with billings noise that people understood that we saw strong net new ACV acceleration in Q1 and expect that as well in Q2 and throughout the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Good night.\nGina Mastantuono: Bye, Samad. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Very much congratulations on the superb quarter, Bill and team. Bill, I have a question for you. It's been a year now since we've been working and running the business virtually. And so one end, you could argue that the deals that are getting close today hurdles that got into the system about a year back or so. Now as we remain virtual, how do you think about lead generation in driving the business for calendar '21 and beyond? And also given that you've had tremendous success selling virtually and rescaling the business virtually. This opening of the economy really have any benefits for ServiceNow incrementally speaking? For Gina, I'll save the follow-up.\nWilliam McDermott: Kash, thank you very much for the question because it's a very important one. Somehow, some way, I actually think some people have this illusion that ServiceNow was advantaged because of COVID. And the truth is that is not the case. The truth is that we lean vaccine management on an emergency response, return to work in vaccine management level it was great for our brand. It was the right thing for our purpose, and it was wonderful in terms of expanding the inspiration of ServiceNow in the global economy. On a financial level, we, like everyone else, had to figure out a new way of connecting with customers. And in that environment, you'll always do better with your existing customers that already really like you and a loyal to you in terms of expanding your portfolio across your base. What you're going to see now is net new logos, net new ACV really kick up into high Gear at ServiceNow, which makes this such an exciting story because our sales force is a largely go-to-market direct sales force. And now they will be able to utilize all of those skills that have been built into that culture and are wired for perfection, really wired for perfection geographically, by industry and by Persona, and that will now be a new tailwind for the investors to enjoy as we progress in 2021. The lead generation, I tried to cover that earlier to, Kash, because I want to really make this clear. We have really refined the company in the context of generating leads. And what I mean by that is we took the brand. We ran a campaign today if you care to see it. You can look at the Wall Street Journal, and you'll see the Wanka campaign because we're letting the world know that the workflow revolution is on. And even the Willy Wonka chocolate factory can run better on the backbone of the ServiceNow platform. And we're educating a whole new generation around what workflow is really all about. And we've taken the brand, the communications, the field, the product marketing and align that to the industry, the GEO, the persona, the inside sales, the direct sales, and we're managing that funnel with a meticulous level of detail around machine learning and AI that manifests itself ultimately in a CEO dashboard, but we manage the whole company on a CRM level that is a really, really world class. In fact, I've never seen it anywhere at the depth of analytics who're running the business on Now. So the leads are not all equal. You have to understand how to manage the pipeline. You have to manage the noise in the pipeline. And as the economy opens up, those processes have been built now for industrial mass scale. So I want to let you know, watch net new ACV, watch net new logos, and watch this machine tick into higher on the back of Knowledge '21 and an already robust and swelling pipeline. We're really in great shape.\nKash Rangan: It sounds like now we go. Gina, question for you. If Bill's take on how the economy opening up will have some implications, ramification. How much of that have you dive into guidance? Or are you keeping guidance relatively conservative, not taking into account all the upside that will -- as you talked about opening the economy that if it does materialize?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I think that we feel really good about our guidance from top line to bottom line. I think the growth is strong, pipeline is good. From an operating margin perspective, it's strong, free cash flow at 30%. I mean, where are you seeing growth that you're seeing, top line and free cash flow margins of 30% with the scale that we're at. So we feel really good about the guidance. We feel really good about the growth, and we'll just continue to keep executing according to plan.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nWilliam McDermott: And Kash, one thing that's really interesting is when Gina talks about those numbers, which I totally agree with, let's keep in mind, it's organic.\nKash Rangan: Absolutely.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Kash.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you so much. I have one for Bill and one for Gina. So Bill, a very big picture question, but a lot you've done to do more in automation with the Intellibot acquisition. There's a lot activity in that sector. I'd like to know where you think ServiceNow fits into that broader automation scheme with so many different types of players out there over the medium to long term? And Gina, I have one for you.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Excellent question, Michael. Many of our customers are trying to drive automation. And they're trying to drive it across a mix of legacy and, of course, modern applications. And when you think about RPA, it's not a particularly differentiating technology, but it's particularly important for integrating with legacy applications that don't support API-based integrations. So what Intellibot does has a very strong experience in developing RPA solution and has existing product capabilities and technical talent that will help us accelerate and enhance our automation efforts. So think about it this way. Our focus is on delivering world-class automation and a platform we call the Now platform. And what we want to do is accelerate digital transformation. And RPA is a piece of that strategy. So RPA will extend our core ServiceNow workflows and it will automate certain repetitive tasks and it'll integrate with these legacy systems for basically intelligent end-to-end automation. And this is strengthened with our existing technologies, such as AI and ML. And as it relates to our participation in the open market, I can tell you that customers tell me that they feel like RPA has left them with islands of automation. And it's getting harder for them to manage as they scale, they're kind of hitting a wall. So what they're looking for is what we are providing, which is a single platform where workflow is the core engine that drives the process. And then they have a choice of the right automation technology for the use case, based on integrations, RPA, decision management or artificial intelligence. So what we'll give them is we'll give them something that's natively integrated into the Now platform. But for example, if you IPF or any other well-known RPA technology out there such as automation anywhere automation anywhere, if they're looking to work with them, that simply integrates into the Now platform. And they support us, and we support them because we're all on the size of the customer, and that's what really matters. And I really think this is a breakthrough a moment in this Q&A because we have taken that position with all participants in the market. But we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. What we do is we workflow end-to-end business processes, and we're automating work to make it work better for people. And if the customer has a certain vendor that they're working with, it integrates seamlessly within Now platform, it's okay. But there's a lot more of them that is saying, give it to me on one platform, make my life simple. I don't want islands of automation. I want a platform that really manages my business in a smart way. Either way the customer wants to work with us, we're happy to work with them.\nMichael Turits: And Gina, my question for you, in some sense, it may be an extension of what Kash was asking. But as you pointed out, you raised the guidance for subscription billings for the year by just under the 1Q raise. And there is still some -- even x the $11 million. There is some slight decel in the next quarter. So is there anything that is, in fact, holding you back from guidance that would have been higher at this point?\nGina Mastantuono: No. The only reason why the full guide wasn't through to the full-year was we had some pull-through of billings from Q2 into Q1 of about $7 million. We feel really good about the guide and there's -- I mean, I think it's a strong guide throughout, and we're going to really see the seasonality, right? So Q2 and Q3, I tried to talk about that whereas we're seeing more and more billing being pushed into Q4, that's really what you're seeing here. We're seeing very strong acceleration of net new in Q2 as well as into Q3 and Q4.\nWilliam McDermott: I think this is worth noting that, like, it's the way the customer wants to do business, right? So when they have a multiproduct contract, then they want to consume and combine and do all these things, we're just seeing the trend line go more towards the Q4 from a seasonality standpoint, but the good news is, and that's why I think Gina did a great job with changing kind of the nomenclature around this to RPO because that's what the customer wants -- we give the customer what they want and the timing that they want. But what I think our investors want out there is they want to know, are you guys getting new logos? Do you guys get net new ACV? Is your pipeline doing great? Do we have room to believe that this is a story that can keep delivering? And the answer to all those questions is yes, yes, yes.\nMichael Turits: Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Gina.\nWilliam McDermott: My pleasure.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with BofA Securities.\nBrad Sills: Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One on the DevOps release, it's exciting because it really could further that evolution of ServiceNow as a custom apps platform. There's always been that potential for ServiceNow to play in that market. But primarily, the success has been in packaged applications, ITSM, ITOM, employee customer workflows. So my question is, is that the case? Does this DevOps solution accelerate the company's kind of move towards a custom apps platform. And given that, that's such a vast market, are there certain areas or cases that you might see success early? Thank you so much.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. I think that's a really insightful question for sure. When you think about what's going on, like I talked about discover in the prepared remarks, right, they were an early adopter of the Qu\u00e9bec release. And what they're doing is trying to give value back to the business. So this -- they shared that it's a better time to be a developer on the ServiceNow platform than ever before. Because they use the new user interface builder. And this capability has allowed them to basically create modern and data-rich applications at an incredible pace. And then at the same time, what you see happening is innovation at the edge of the enterprise. Like I'm the executive sponsor for one of the biggest banking customers in the world. They've got to modernize 5,000 applications. So as I saying to me is how can I, for my business people. Modernize an application really quick or build a net new application. So what you're seeing is this convergence now between the developers and the business people demanding innovation and change swiftly coming together on the Now platform. This business, I would not be surprised if it ends up being the biggest business we have. I see the money going to the cloud, whether it's multi-cloud platforms, it's SaaS platforms or its app innovation at the edge of the enterprise, and we are right there. And the fact that we can connect it across all the experience zones, all the way back to IT, security, DevOps, et cetera, gives us a unique competitive differentiation and competitive advantage.\nBrad Sills: That\u2019s great, Bill. Thank you so much.\nWilliam McDermott: My pleasure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with [JPMorgan]\nSterling Auty: With JPMorgan. Thanks, guys. Just one question from my side. So on those hard-hit industries, you called out airlines. So I'm just kind of curious, what percentage of those -- that roughly 20% of revenue in the hard-hit industries are in the airline use case where there's still a headwind versus the rest that maybe are starting to bounce back and maybe look at incremental investment for digital transformation?\nGina Mastantuono: It's - yes. So thanks, Sterling. It's much, much smaller. It's less than 5%. And so we are really seeing a bounce back in the bulk of those industries that we've called out last year as being part of the 20%. And we talked about some really large deals in some of those verticals, including retail, entertainment, transportation and manufacturing in this quarter, as well as the renewal rates in those industries are actually higher. So what's really happening, as you can imagine, is these customers who have been harder hit, they're more focused than ever on reducing risk, taking out costs, driving productivity. And so they are leaning in even more heavily with ServiceNow before. And so I just wanted to make sure that people understood that not every customer is in that lucky position right now. And there are still some that are hard hit, and we continue to work with them and help them through it. But yes, the bulk of this industry are really bouncing back fairly well and really helping lean into this digital transformation that we're seeing.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we do have time for one more question from Derek Wood.\nUnidentified Analyst: Question back on the low-code side of the market. There certainly seems to be just a lot more market dialogue around low-code tools to accelerate transformation. And Bill, I'd love to hear who's championing these initiatives? And will you be looking to add new kinds of sales motions to target the citizen developer outside of IT? And then maybe if you could just touch on, I think, Qu\u00e9bec had a focus on advancing some low-code, anything to highlight there? Thanks.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Sure. First of all, I would just remind you that like ServiceNow is positioning, enabling line of business users to develop workflow automation is really perfect. And we are at the kind of epicenter, I would say, of secular tailwinds, wins, which are forming around the convergence of IT and business, which I said earlier. So App modernization, operational transformation, IT in the business, they're all moving as quickly as possible to drive greater efficiency and more agility. This is a product already today where we have a very capable leader in engineering, Josh Conn, who's been with us now for some time. And when I first came in here, the first thing he said to me is, hey, I'm raising my hand. This could be big. And I said, we're going to get all behind you. So we already have specialists sales force that complement general line to make sure that we capitalize on this opportunity. And I think the reason that this opportunity is so smoke and hot right now is there just aren't enough developers to build the applications that the enterprise need to transform their business. So this huge unmet need in application delivery is really falling right on to the Now platform and these creative workflows are really driving the foundation of the partnership with our customers, tying together engineering and the business executives. So I would just say to you that we have -- we don't need to like hire new sales force to do this. We already got the specialist, we already got the great engineering, and our team really understands app engine. It really understands the platform, even the general line AE in the field sees this as a golden opportunity. And we've aligned all the empowerment levels and the compensation schemes and all the focus to be there because we know that's where the money is.\nGina Mastantuono: I'll just add one thing, Derek, to say that the IT organizations are becoming more and more important here because the businesses, while -- yes, they bought these applications. The IT organization is responsible for ensuring they're safe, secure, right? And so the partnership between the business and IT is becoming stronger and stronger. And ServiceNow is the platform that's strategic to IT, trusted, scalable and secure. And it's a platform that IT is going to continue to use to build these mission-critical applications for the lines of business. And so really, we are very well positioned given our strategic relevancy in the suite with the CIO.\nWilliam McDermott: And Derek, keep in mind, right, Gina is absolutely right. The company started at IT. So this is actually a core strength of ours. And then we move to the employee and the customer and now it's all about the app engine in sort of this low-code world that we see conversion between business and IT. Our company grew up there. It's now prime time because business is pulling at engineering and IT to say, I want my new modern application, and I want to now. So we're kind of right there. The other thing we probably could have covered in greater detail, but I think you already all know this, is this one architecture, one data model and one platform is really coming through strong now. Because most companies out there are either best-of-breed where they do one thing particularly well, but not many things, or they have many different platforms that aren't so well integrated. In our case, even as we put new innovation on the Now platform, it's all integrated, and it all works. So folks are really excited about that within these enterprises because they got a lot riding on whatever they invest in working, pleasing people, delivering a positive ROI, and really making the decision-makers that invest in the platform look good because there's no tech debt with ServiceNow.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. We can't wait to see the Waka campaign, too. But thanks for all.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to all of you. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call. I hope everyone remains healthy and safe, and you and your loved ones are benefiting from broader vaccine availability. ServiceNow remains grateful to be in such a strong position to help support our families, communities and customers. We started 2021 with another outstanding quarter, delivering a perfect balance of growth and profitability. Our team is executing, maintaining a swift pace towards our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond. In Q1, we grew subscription revenue 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance. We delivered strong profitability with operating margin over 27%, and we increased free cash flow margin 7 points year-over-year to 46%. Our significant Q1 beat across the Board represents the passion our culture has for innovating and our relentless focus on the customer. We are ideally positioned to deliver what our customers need. In the past year, the transformation of work has accelerated the adoption of digital products, services and experiences. As a result, digital investments are an all-time high and will total more than $7.8 trillion by 2024 according to IDC. ServiceNow is the strategic authority for digital transformation across the enterprise. We have expanded the boundaries from IT to employee, customer and now creator workflows for citizen developers. The digital economy is firing on all cylinders, and so are we. Our culture was born for this moment. Our team of 14,000 colleagues are exponential thinkers. This is how we continuously bring innovation to everything we do. In just the past 18 months, we have more than doubled the features and functionality of our platform for our customers. We're at the epicenter of the workflow revolution. Our purpose has never been more relevant. We are making the world of work, work better for people. We are helping our customers drink bit and to build their digital bridge to the future. Xerox, for example, is working with ServiceNow to transform the services industry, leveraging our field service management, their technicians will use machine learning to proactively solve customer problems. They're using virtual and augmented reality tools to resolve their customers' issues via desktop, mobile and smart glass devices. In this bold mill world is as if their agents are there in person. Digital transformation is about creating great employee and customer experiences. In an increasingly distributed hybrid workforce, companies need to create frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. This requires seamless cross enterprise workflows, linking systems, silos, departments and processes, only the Now platform can do this with native integrations. The platform of platforms, the power of one, one data model, one architecture, one enterprise solution to workflow every business challenge. This is what ServiceNow delivers. We are the only ones doing what we do, the way we do it. Strong demand for ServiceNow is evident in our results, high growth, organically driven at mass scale, while aggressively investing in future growth and delivering significant profitability. An amazing business model and a true testament to the power of the Now platform. Our teams keep innovating. We're proud that Que\u0301bec, our latest platform release delivered 1,700 new customer capabilities, breakthrough innovations like predictive AI operations, AI search and virtual agents that enhance every experience, to name a few. ServiceNow is helping customers move to the cloud and invent new business models. The past year has demonstrated that giving people the right productivity tools is critical to success, especially in distributed work environments. It's why organizations like Adobe, Deutsche Telekom, Logitech, city of Los Angeles and Discover are using the Now platform. Discover, in fact, is fully utilizing the Now platform's ease of upgrade, participating in the early adopter program for our Que\u0301bec release. Now Discover is able to focus on timely availability, and adoption of new functionality, the Now platform is the gold standard for time to value. By the end of 2021, Forrester Research predicts that 75% of development shops will use low-code platforms. With Que\u0301bec, we are delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of the engineering organization and into the hands of citizen developers. Employees without software expertise who need to quickly create workflow applications. We're seeing strong response. The National Cancer Institute at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is a great example. NCI has established a digital service center around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. In just 10 days, NCI leverage ServiceNow to build a new application for an online portal to collect and track specimens from COVID-19 patients. ServiceNow's low-code app is helping NCI staff support the global research community in understanding how genetic factors contribute to the severity of COVID-19 cases. We also introduced process and workforce optimization capabilities in our new enterprise SKUs. This brings even more intelligence to our customers, allowing them to be more agile. We're putting new AI capabilities in the hands of our customers, so they can enhance productivity while spending more time on human creativity. With our recent acquisition of Intellibot, ServiceNow will have an unmatched intelligent workflow automation solution with RPA, AI, machine learning and process mining native to the Now platform. You'll hear more about this from our Chief Product and Engineering Officer, CJ Desai, at our upcoming Investor Day. Please be there. Now let's look more closely at Q1 performance highlights across our portfolio. Our better together solutions continue to drive more multi-product deals. Our core IT workflows remain strong. ITSM was in 12 of our top 20 deals. Our AI and ML capabilities embedded with our pro SKU, continue to resonate with customers. ITOM had a strong quarter and was in 13 of the top 20 deals. EMEA was especially strong. We're hitting a new Gear with CEO engagement. We're seeing more demand across industries, including financial services as EU banking regulations require companies to have full visibility into their assets while also managing risk. HSBC, for example, chose ServiceNow in a multiyear partnership as their workflow partner of choice to help them digitize at scale. Supporting HSBC's employees, ServiceNow will deliver the technologies needed to simplify their architectural landscape. This creates efficiencies, better controls and compliance. Australia and New Zealand Banking group also chose the ServiceNow platform to consolidate, simplify its IT systems and streamline operations to improve the employee experience. The Now platform gives them the advantage of a fully integrated view of technology and risk. We continue to see strength in our customer workflows. Our investment in the telco vertical are gaining traction daily and it's materializing in wins across the globe. Lumen Technologies, a leading telecommunications company is transforming its customer care, and assurance function with ServiceNow customer workflows. They will use the Now platform to deliver best-in-class customer experiences across their networking, cloud and security solutions. Telia, a leading multinational telecommunications company, selected ServiceNow to transform service operations, connecting network operations, employees and customers around the world. Creating workflows, our platform business was in 19 of our top 20 deals. Three of our top 10 app engine wins came from APJ where we are seeing increased awareness of ServiceNow and is continuing to drive demand. A large global manufacturing company in Japan is planning to use our app engine to automate manual processes take out cost and risk associated with migrating on-premise applications to the cloud. This will be a movement in Japan. In the US, the Now platform is at the heart of the city of Los Angeles' digital transformation, helping to provide reliable access to essential services for its four million citizens. The city is expanding its use of digital technology to provide immediate access services, which enables citizens to get the assistance they deserve. Employee workflows were included in eight of our top 20 deals. Zalando is a leading online platform for fashion and lifestyle, connecting customers, brands and partners. As part of their HR transformation, they will implement a central employee services portal using ServiceNow's employee workflows. Zalando sees this as a critical component in supporting their growth, and improving their employee experiences. Employee and workplace safety are top of mind for our customers. We are the only company with a complete suite of applications to meet these critical needs. Since the start of the pandemic, ServiceNow has been at the forefront of solving unprecedented challenges. We saw the meet early and acted quickly. First, our emergency response apps, then our safe workplace apps and now with vaccine administration management, we leverage the speed and agility of the Now platform and the incredible talent of our product team to innovate fast, deliver market-leading solutions to support our customers and help keep them safe. You see, organization trap in the last mile of vaccine management as they lack the processes and infrastructure needed to vaccinate people quickly. This is the workflow challenge of our time. To address these challenges, organizations are using the Now platform as their vaccine management manage center. Our workflows are connected organization's existing technology infrastructure to help orchestrate the critical elements of the vaccine management process, including distributing administering and monitoring vaccines. The Minnesota children's hospital implemented our vaccine administration management in five days, so they can stay focused on their number one priority, caring for children. The hospital is using ServiceNow virtual assistant to answer questions and scheduled patient vaccinations. They are leveraging inventory tracking and scheduling to ensure appointments, staffing levels and vaccines are all in sync. Germany's largest state, North Ryan Westfalia, is using ServiceNow to support vaccinations for millions of people. Within two hours of the portal going live, 120,000 people have registered and received an appointment. ServiceNow ended Q1 working with over 100 organizations and governments globally to help vaccinate people at scale. We are supporting the delivery and management of millions of vaccines globally. We will continue to do more. The workflow revolution is all about helping people. We are humbled to be helping so many people around the world manage this workflow challenge. In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong momentum. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year and what they continue to achieve. From the beginning of this pandemic, we have focused on taking care of our people and taking care of our customers. That's why we're so grateful to be named to the Fortune 100 Best places to work list for the first time. And we're proud to have increased our position on the Fortune Best Workplaces in Technology list by more than 10 points. Our culture demonstrates time and again how we powered through all-weather conditions. Our engineering pride is unmatched. Our innovation relentless and our customer focus tireless. We have a very, very robust pipeline. Substantially greater than anything we've seen before. We have all the learnings of digital customer relationship management. Our strong go-to-market organization is operating in high gear. Our customer services and partner ecosystem is accelerating time to value. Our business is ever resilient. Our opportunities never greater. We continue to work with some of the world's greatest brands, including BMW, Bristol-Myers Squibb, FIS, Subway, Standard & Poor's, we're honored to be their digital transformation partner. And we're also excited to highlight even more customers at our upcoming knowledge 21 experience in May, which will be our biggest customer event ever. And we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day. This ServiceNow machine is firing on all cylinders. We're not slowing down. We are well on our way to $10 billion and beyond, and we are striving with all we have to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Gina, over to you. Yes, absolutely. I'd be happy to, Keith. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is we've done all of those things. With Que\u0301bec, we're delivering new low-code tools that move app development beyond the borders of just the engineering organization and really into the hands of the citizen developers. So as you know, with digital transformation is a whole move to modernized apps, and this is really tying engineering and business together, and we're seeing a greater market awareness for ServiceNow's digital transformation enablement to automate manual processes within organizations. And we have a focus in this company on being the platform of all platforms, which means, we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. So lots of folks integrate into the Now platform. And our low-code, no-code app development to create new workflows that deliver great experiences is really taking off. And I gave a couple of examples in our prepared remarks, one such example is a National Cancer Institute. So if you think about what they're doing at NCI, they established a digital service center of excellence, and they've done that around ServiceNow's low-code app engine platform. And when you think about time to value, it's just 10 days, they were up and running with an online portal to collect and track specimens of COVID-19 patients. So we think that this is going to be a runaway success story for the company. And when you look at the year-on-year growth here and you look at the pipeline, we are extremely bullish on this business. Thank you, Keith. Sure. Absolutely, Alex. First of all, when you look at the pipeline in my prepared remarks, I was very careful to point out that it's never been better than it is right now. And in fact, it's outstanding. And has a couple of driving forces here. One, if you look at EMEA as a theater, the EMEA business is smoking hot. And you saw 80% year-on-year growth in the first quarter out of EMEA. So let that be the first indicator that the brand is now alive and - we are operating extremely well through the Rolodex of EMEA and the CEOs across various industries and various mission-critical geographies are adopting us as the workflow standard. Continue to believe in EMEA as a great wellspring of growth to ServiceNow, and that was a big one for us to get really rolling. The other piece is APJ. We're seeing now outstanding growth out of APJ, and I would say the same is true for the brand. Now we're well known. We're on fire in Japan. As you know, Japan is an on-premise market and needs to move to the cloud. The workflow revolution is one great way to get them going in the cloud. I gave an example of that in my prepared remarks. We're also expecting better things that was with the leadership adjustment that we've made. We see South Korea doing extremely well. So I want you to believe in APJ is yet another well spring of growth that can go higher and higher with ServiceNow. We've always been strong in the Americas. The Americas had an extraordinary Q4, as you know, and they'll kick back into their normal growth rates at higher and be on course with where we wanted them to be at the end of Q2. So you add all that up in the geographic theaters and the business is in great shape. The other thing we've done is really focused on some breakthrough industries, financial services and telecommunications quickly come to mind, where once we get rolling, the Bowling alley effect takes effect very, very quickly here. And keep in mind, we're now in a global economy. That is shifting quickly to lights back on. Last year, GDP was down substantially in the global economy, yet digital transformation spend was up. This year as the economy comes back, they're not slowing down digital transformation spend, actually, it's also going up, but the economy is waking up. So what's gorgeous about this for us is we now have the CRM techniques of digital selling, combine it with the direct selling that always worked well. And some of the techniques that we've enabled also on inside selling and how we've taken the whole marketing value chain from the brand and communications to field marketing, industry specialization product marketing and then all the resources in the field to basically take that industry specific, value-driven story to the customer, and we've aligned that with our services organization, and an expansive ecosystem with all the big partners betting long on ServiceNow, setting up global practices with ServiceNow. So Alex, I've been in this business for 20 years. I've never seen an opportunity like this in my career, and I actually think we're just getting started. Thank you very much. Yes. Thanks, Samad. It's actually very obvious that with a change in administration, everybody has to get their offices and get settled in place and budgets have to be allocated and so on. So we see the light turning on the business model at the federal level very strongly in Q2. And we expected that all along. So it makes up about 10% of our business now. So it's a big part of our business, and the pipeline is absolutely swelling, and it's swelling because of the change in administration. But the administration, as you know, is very focused on digital transformation because it's really the only way to run a much more refined, low cost, high delivery process for the constituents to put in office. So everybody is highly aware of that. And we do fantastic, as you know, in federal. And in fact, Homeland security, many other departments have chosen us a vaccine management just as one thing to give you. And state and local, we're doing really good and again, a groundswell of opportunity there. And I do believe as we go through Q2 and into Q3 and Q4, the deals will just get larger and the business will come in stronger as we go. We're doing great in federal, state and local. Kash, thank you very much for the question because it's a very important one. Somehow, some way, I actually think some people have this illusion that ServiceNow was advantaged because of COVID. And the truth is that is not the case. The truth is that we lean vaccine management on an emergency response, return to work in vaccine management level it was great for our brand. It was the right thing for our purpose, and it was wonderful in terms of expanding the inspiration of ServiceNow in the global economy. On a financial level, we, like everyone else, had to figure out a new way of connecting with customers. And in that environment, you'll always do better with your existing customers that already really like you and a loyal to you in terms of expanding your portfolio across your base. What you're going to see now is net new logos, net new ACV really kick up into high Gear at ServiceNow, which makes this such an exciting story because our sales force is a largely go-to-market direct sales force. And now they will be able to utilize all of those skills that have been built into that culture and are wired for perfection, really wired for perfection geographically, by industry and by Persona, and that will now be a new tailwind for the investors to enjoy as we progress in 2021. The lead generation, I tried to cover that earlier to, Kash, because I want to really make this clear. We have really refined the company in the context of generating leads. And what I mean by that is we took the brand. We ran a campaign today if you care to see it. You can look at the Wall Street Journal, and you'll see the Wanka campaign because we're letting the world know that the workflow revolution is on. And even the Willy Wonka chocolate factory can run better on the backbone of the ServiceNow platform. And we're educating a whole new generation around what workflow is really all about. And we've taken the brand, the communications, the field, the product marketing and align that to the industry, the GEO, the persona, the inside sales, the direct sales, and we're managing that funnel with a meticulous level of detail around machine learning and AI that manifests itself ultimately in a CEO dashboard, but we manage the whole company on a CRM level that is a really, really world class. In fact, I've never seen it anywhere at the depth of analytics who're running the business on Now. So the leads are not all equal. You have to understand how to manage the pipeline. You have to manage the noise in the pipeline. And as the economy opens up, those processes have been built now for industrial mass scale. So I want to let you know, watch net new ACV, watch net new logos, and watch this machine tick into higher on the back of Knowledge '21 and an already robust and swelling pipeline. We're really in great shape. And Kash, one thing that's really interesting is when Gina talks about those numbers, which I totally agree with, let's keep in mind, it's organic. Thank you, Kash. Yes. Excellent question, Michael. Many of our customers are trying to drive automation. And they're trying to drive it across a mix of legacy and, of course, modern applications. And when you think about RPA, it's not a particularly differentiating technology, but it's particularly important for integrating with legacy applications that don't support API-based integrations. So what Intellibot does has a very strong experience in developing RPA solution and has existing product capabilities and technical talent that will help us accelerate and enhance our automation efforts. So think about it this way. Our focus is on delivering world-class automation and a platform we call the Now platform. And what we want to do is accelerate digital transformation. And RPA is a piece of that strategy. So RPA will extend our core ServiceNow workflows and it will automate certain repetitive tasks and it'll integrate with these legacy systems for basically intelligent end-to-end automation. And this is strengthened with our existing technologies, such as AI and ML. And as it relates to our participation in the open market, I can tell you that customers tell me that they feel like RPA has left them with islands of automation. And it's getting harder for them to manage as they scale, they're kind of hitting a wall. So what they're looking for is what we are providing, which is a single platform where workflow is the core engine that drives the process. And then they have a choice of the right automation technology for the use case, based on integrations, RPA, decision management or artificial intelligence. So what we'll give them is we'll give them something that's natively integrated into the Now platform. But for example, if you IPF or any other well-known RPA technology out there such as automation anywhere automation anywhere, if they're looking to work with them, that simply integrates into the Now platform. And they support us, and we support them because we're all on the size of the customer, and that's what really matters. And I really think this is a breakthrough a moment in this Q&A because we have taken that position with all participants in the market. But we don't need anyone to lose for us to win. What we do is we workflow end-to-end business processes, and we're automating work to make it work better for people. And if the customer has a certain vendor that they're working with, it integrates seamlessly within Now platform, it's okay. But there's a lot more of them that is saying, give it to me on one platform, make my life simple. I don't want islands of automation. I want a platform that really manages my business in a smart way. Either way the customer wants to work with us, we're happy to work with them. I think this is worth noting that, like, it's the way the customer wants to do business, right? So when they have a multiproduct contract, then they want to consume and combine and do all these things, we're just seeing the trend line go more towards the Q4 from a seasonality standpoint, but the good news is, and that's why I think Gina did a great job with changing kind of the nomenclature around this to RPO because that's what the customer wants -- we give the customer what they want and the timing that they want. But what I think our investors want out there is they want to know, are you guys getting new logos? Do you guys get net new ACV? Is your pipeline doing great? Do we have room to believe that this is a story that can keep delivering? And the answer to all those questions is yes, yes, yes. My pleasure. Yes. I think that's a really insightful question for sure. When you think about what's going on, like I talked about discover in the prepared remarks, right, they were an early adopter of the Que\u0301bec release. And what they're doing is trying to give value back to the business. So this -- they shared that it's a better time to be a developer on the ServiceNow platform than ever before. Because they use the new user interface builder. And this capability has allowed them to basically create modern and data-rich applications at an incredible pace. And then at the same time, what you see happening is innovation at the edge of the enterprise. Like I'm the executive sponsor for one of the biggest banking customers in the world. They've got to modernize 5,000 applications. So as I saying to me is how can I, for my business people. Modernize an application really quick or build a net new application. So what you're seeing is this convergence now between the developers and the business people demanding innovation and change swiftly coming together on the Now platform. This business, I would not be surprised if it ends up being the biggest business we have. I see the money going to the cloud, whether it's multi-cloud platforms, it's SaaS platforms or its app innovation at the edge of the enterprise, and we are right there. And the fact that we can connect it across all the experience zones, all the way back to IT, security, DevOps, et cetera, gives us a unique competitive differentiation and competitive advantage. My pleasure. Thank you. Yes. Sure. First of all, I would just remind you that like ServiceNow is positioning, enabling line of business users to develop workflow automation is really perfect. And we are at the kind of epicenter, I would say, of secular tailwinds, wins, which are forming around the convergence of IT and business, which I said earlier. So App modernization, operational transformation, IT in the business, they're all moving as quickly as possible to drive greater efficiency and more agility. This is a product already today where we have a very capable leader in engineering, Josh Conn, who's been with us now for some time. And when I first came in here, the first thing he said to me is, hey, I'm raising my hand. This could be big. And I said, we're going to get all behind you. So we already have specialists sales force that complement general line to make sure that we capitalize on this opportunity. And I think the reason that this opportunity is so smoke and hot right now is there just aren't enough developers to build the applications that the enterprise need to transform their business. So this huge unmet need in application delivery is really falling right on to the Now platform and these creative workflows are really driving the foundation of the partnership with our customers, tying together engineering and the business executives. So I would just say to you that we have -- we don't need to like hire new sales force to do this. We already got the specialist, we already got the great engineering, and our team really understands app engine. It really understands the platform, even the general line AE in the field sees this as a golden opportunity. And we've aligned all the empowerment levels and the compensation schemes and all the focus to be there because we know that's where the money is. And Derek, keep in mind, right, Gina is absolutely right. The company started at IT. So this is actually a core strength of ours. And then we move to the employee and the customer and now it's all about the app engine in sort of this low-code world that we see conversion between business and IT. Our company grew up there. It's now prime time because business is pulling at engineering and IT to say, I want my new modern application, and I want to now. So we're kind of right there. The other thing we probably could have covered in greater detail, but I think you already all know this, is this one architecture, one data model and one platform is really coming through strong now. Because most companies out there are either best-of-breed where they do one thing particularly well, but not many things, or they have many different platforms that aren't so well integrated. In our case, even as we put new innovation on the Now platform, it's all integrated, and it all works. So folks are really excited about that within these enterprises because they got a lot riding on whatever they invest in working, pleasing people, delivering a positive ROI, and really making the decision-makers that invest in the platform look good because there's no tech debt with ServiceNow. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a great start to the year. On the heels of a tremendous Q4, the team continued to execute well and delivered another strong quarter of outperformance. We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenue, subscription billings and cRPO guidance and those top line beats carried through to a very robust operating margin and strong free cash flow. Q1 subscription revenues were $1.293 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 4-point tailwind from FX. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.8 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth, putting us well on our way towards our $10 billion revenue target. Current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion representing 33% year-over-year growth and 100 basis points beat versus our guidance. Notably, we delivered that beat with 100 basis points less of an FX tailwind. Due to the weaker euro, currency contributed four points instead of our original outlook for a 5-point tailwind. Q1 subscription billings were $1.365 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth and a $3 million beat versus the high end of our guidance. FX and duration were a 4-point tailwind year-over-year. As Bill mentioned, we saw particular strength in EMEA as investments made in 2020 are gaining traction. In Q1, the region closed one of its largest deals ever, helping to drive very strong year-over-year net new ACV growth. We're also seeing improving trends in APJ, where we were in two of the top three platform deals in the quarter. We continue to see the secular tailwinds driven by the intersection of digital transformation, cloud computing and business model innovation. Every C-suite leader wants to create great experiences for their employees and their customers, and ServiceNow is delivering. The Now platform offers the speed flexibility and innovation companies needs. The sustained strength of our top line growth is the result of consistent execution from across the organization as we address these opportunities. From our engineers who continue to drive leading edge innovation to the sales and customer success teams who partner with our customers to ensure we're delivering value and everyone else in between that helped to deliver great experiences. It's been a tremendous team effort. Our renewal rate remains strong at 97% as the Now platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We closed 37 deals greater than one million ACV in the quarter, including seven net new customers. Our focus on selling comprehensive solutions instead of point products continue to drive more multi-product fields as 17 of our top 20 deals included three or more products. We now have 1,146 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 23% year-over-year, and the number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 50% year-over-year. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 27%, up 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by our strong top line outperformance and the timing of some spend that will shift into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 46%, up 700 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong collections and lower T&E. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro trends we're seeing in our business. The industry is highly affected by COVID that we outlined earlier last year, which represent about 20% of our business, remains resilient in Q1. We closed several 7-figure deals in these verticals, and renewal rates were ahead of the company average. However, we did continue to see some headwinds in severely impacted industries such as airlines. Regardless of the industry, in an increasingly distributed and hybrid workforce, companies need to create consistent and frictionless experiences that make it easy for employees to get work done. Digital investments are at an all-time high and are expected to continue growing as companies must reinvest themselves for the new economy. ServiceNow is the strategic authority in digital transformation, and we're committed to helping our customers succeed in that journey. These strong secular tailwinds paired with the strength and agility of the Now platform positions us well for 2021 and beyond. Pipeline generation has remained robust globally, even ahead of our Knowledge 2021 event, which is a big driver, particularly for the Americas. It is helping to drive the net new ACV acceleration in our business this year. Enterprises around the world are recognizing the strength of our one architecture model and its ability to deliver great scalable experiences with speed and efficiency. Now let's turn to guidance. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.29 billion and $1.295 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth, including a 300 basis point FX tailwind. We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including a 250 basis point FX tailwind. We expect subscription billings between $1.25 billion and $1.255 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 300 basis points. We expect an operating margin of 21.5%, which includes $15 million of sales and marketing spend that shifted out of Q1 and into Q2, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. For the full year 2021, we're raising our top line growth guidance on a constant currency basis. We are increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription revenue expectations by $32 million based on the strong trends we saw in Q1. However, a weaker euro resulted in a $59 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription revenues between $5.455 billion and $5.47 billion, representing 27% to 28% year-over-year growth. This includes a 200 basis point FX tailwind. Similarly, we're increasing the midpoint of our previous subscription billings expectation by $50 million on a constant currency basis. However, the weaker euro resulted in a $68 million headwind to our growth. Taken together, we expect subscription billings between $6.19 billion and $6.205 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth. This includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 150 basis points. In terms of quarterly seasonality, we're continuing to see a shift of Q2 and Q3 subscription billings into Q4. We now expect about 21% of our total subscription billings to be in Q3 and 37% to be in Q4. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 85% and operating margin of 23.5%. Finally, we expect recapture margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year. You'll hear more about our strategy and long-term opportunity at our upcoming Investor Day on May 10, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. In addition to making work, work better for people, we're also committed to making the world work better as well. This week, we unveiled our first ever global impact report. At our Investor Day, I'm excited to be able to share ServiceNow's global impact strategy with you. In conclusion, ServiceNow is leading this once in a generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. We are focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. We have the platform businesses need and where the workflow standard for enterprise transformation. Customers are using the Now platform to create new workflows for new value chains, to improve experiences across silo systems and functions to reduce friction in people's daily lives, and it's showing in our financial results. I'm very excited about the future in front of us. Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world for helping to make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best places to work. ServiceNow's greatest strength is its people, and you all continue to make us ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this team. And with that, I'll open it up to Q&A. Sure. So I'll take the first question on the Q2 billings and the deceleration from Q1. So first off, you can see in our IR deck that in Q1, we had $11 million in multi-year billings that we don't expect to occur in Q2. So that's part of the deceleration. As well, we talked about timing, and we've talked about this in the past and why billings is not the best metric, right, because if customers are co terming during the contract period, they often renew early, which changes the timing of renewals and really impact billings. And so one of the reasons why billings is not the greatest of metrics and why we are pointing to and giving guidance now for cRPO of 30% in Q2. What I would say is that we are, in fact, seeing a reacceleration of net new ACV in Q2, given the Q2 comp from last year. It's just that there is a lot of noise in billings. And so I just continue to really stress that we should be looking more at cRPO. And then for the full-year, it's about 28% normalized because remember, last year, we had the pull forward of $80 million of billings out of Q1 of 2021 and into Q4. And so the full-year guide, we have increased it by almost the full Q1 be that you're seeing. A very welcome. Yes. I mean the RPO is definitely a better guide, and there's less noise in it than billings, but there is noise. There's no perfect forward indicator for you. And so if you think about contracted upsells, for example, on the timing of renewals, that could impact cRPO. Additionally, self-hosted deals could potentially impact the RPO vis-a\u0300-vis revenue growth. So there's no one perfect indicator, but cRPO is definitely a stronger indicator with less noise. So we will continue to guide one quarter out, and we'll continue to stress that. It has less noise and less confusion in it than the billings metric. Thank you. Yes. I would say that we were really pleased with new logo growth in Q1. We saw strong growth in our new logos and seven new customers greater than $1 million across several verticals, right, pharmaceutical, insurance, e-commerce, just to name a few. And most of these deals actually had 4-plus products. And so we are continuing to see good traction in the new logos and obviously existing as well. And so we saw -- we're not going to give you numbers, but I wanted to make sure, again, with billings noise that people understood that we saw strong net new ACV acceleration in Q1 and expect that as well in Q2 and throughout the year. Bye, Samad. Thank you. Yes. I think that we feel really good about our guidance from top line to bottom line. I think the growth is strong, pipeline is good. From an operating margin perspective, it's strong, free cash flow at 30%. I mean, where are you seeing growth that you're seeing, top line and free cash flow margins of 30% with the scale that we're at. So we feel really good about the guidance. We feel really good about the growth, and we'll just continue to keep executing according to plan. Thanks, Kash. No. The only reason why the full guide wasn't through to the full-year was we had some pull-through of billings from Q2 into Q1 of about $7 million. We feel really good about the guide and there's -- I mean, I think it's a strong guide throughout, and we're going to really see the seasonality, right? So Q2 and Q3, I tried to talk about that whereas we're seeing more and more billing being pushed into Q4, that's really what you're seeing here. We're seeing very strong acceleration of net new in Q2 as well as into Q3 and Q4. Thank you. It's - yes. So thanks, Sterling. It's much, much smaller. It's less than 5%. And so we are really seeing a bounce back in the bulk of those industries that we've called out last year as being part of the 20%. And we talked about some really large deals in some of those verticals, including retail, entertainment, transportation and manufacturing in this quarter, as well as the renewal rates in those industries are actually higher. So what's really happening, as you can imagine, is these customers who have been harder hit, they're more focused than ever on reducing risk, taking out costs, driving productivity. And so they are leaning in even more heavily with ServiceNow before. And so I just wanted to make sure that people understood that not every customer is in that lucky position right now. And there are still some that are hard hit, and we continue to work with them and help them through it. But yes, the bulk of this industry are really bouncing back fairly well and really helping lean into this digital transformation that we're seeing. You're welcome. I'll just add one thing, Derek, to say that the IT organizations are becoming more and more important here because the businesses, while -- yes, they bought these applications. The IT organization is responsible for ensuring they're safe, secure, right? And so the partnership between the business and IT is becoming stronger and stronger. And ServiceNow is the platform that's strategic to IT, trusted, scalable and secure. And it's a platform that IT is going to continue to use to build these mission-critical applications for the lines of business. And so really, we are very well positioned given our strategic relevancy in the suite with the CIO. Thank you."

At the time, I'll turn things over to Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Darren, please go ahead.\nDarren Yip: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer.  During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you, Darren, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. ServiceNow continues to perform as-the-beyond expectations company. For Q4, we beat guidance with subscription revenue growth of 27.5% in constant currency. Operating margin was 28%, 2 points above our guidance. Our free cash flow margin was 30%, 1 point above our guidance. We had 126 deals greater than $1 million in Q4, including our largest deals ever worldwide in EMEA and in Latin America. Our 98% renewal rate remains the industry benchmark. With 25.5% constant currency cRPO growth, we actually had better-than-expected new business in Q4 with less reliance on early renewals. Based on this new business surge, we are giving a very strong guidance for 2023. Our guidance reflects a disciplined forecast that appropriately balances our well-founded optimism for ServiceNow's business. We'll work hard to go beyond it, and we'll begin that march in Q1.  Here is the main takeaway. Even in a complex operating environment, ServiceNow is executing at the rule of 58.5%. We are driving net new innovation, fast growth and operating leverage. ServiceNow is the proverbial safe harbor in all weather conditions.  Let me unpack the current environment for you. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation aren't going anywhere. IDC's research makes a clear that technology budgets are growing. They forecast IT spend will grow 5% in 2023, software spend at 8% and Software-as-a-Service spend at 15%. So as businesses increase spend, the only question then is where will all that investment go? And this answer has everything to do with the great reprioritization. The theme in Davos this year was cooperation in a fragmented world. It all begins with a fragmented enterprise. C-level buyers don't want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, \"We can't afford 1,000 points of dim light. We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.\" So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow.  This begins with our business model. ServiceNow was born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world. Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation. ServiceNow has natively embedded the complete tool set from AI to RPA to process mining in our platform. Now professional developers and the rest of us, real people like you and me, can build mission-critical applications to automate the world of work. Everything culminates with real business outcomes.  ServiceNow integrates the enterprise to deliver better customer service, employee experiences, security, risk management and next-generation business processes like Procure to Pay, technology foundation, hyper automation, process orchestration. With this completeness of vision, ServiceNow is the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. If all we did was help existing customers consume everything this platform can do, we would stay a fast-growth company. But of course, our strategy goes well beyond this as does our proven ability to execute.  Right now, many technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage. It also allowed us to continue hiring, especially in engineering and quota-carrying roles. The results tell the story. ITSM was in 14 of our top 20 deals, with 15 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 16 of the top 20, with 14 deals over $1 million. Security and Risk Solutions were at 13 of the top 20, with 9 deals over $1 million. Customer workflows were in 13 of the top 20, with 13 deals over $1 million. Employee workflows were 13 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million. And create workloads were in 19 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million.  We saw new business growth, new logos and major expansions with some of our existing customers. The United States Army expanded its ServiceNow road map well beyond IT. ServiceNow will improve the Army's ability to consolidate service management for its over 1 million active military contractor and civilian population. The Schwarz Group, one of the world's top retailers will digitize its 11,000 stores from retail locations to logistics on ServiceNow as its digital business platform. This transition is a transformation and it will position the Schwarz Group at the forefront of the next-generation retail industry. From Banco do Brasil, to AT&T, to Sumitomo, we have countless stories that span ServiceNow's workflows, Lightstep, geographic regions and industries across the board, we're winning. And as you'll hear from Gina, we grew new business 100% year-over-year across retail, hospitality, transportation and logistics. That's only one example. And with the expansion of ServiceNow's impact, we are setting the standard for speed of deployment and business value for our customers.  More than three years ago, I stated our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And this is an ambition I will see through to its full completion. Following my elevation of Chairman and CEO, I'm delighted to announce that CJ Desai has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. CJ is the leader of consequence, well known in the industry. His track record in ServiceNow speaks for itself from strengthening our platform to driving our customer experience. This is exactly how we are orchestrating our company to perform on an end-to-end basis from innovation to execution with our customers. And I'd like to personally congratulate CJ for his latest well-deserved endorsement of his leadership. Congratulations, CJ.  In other news, we proudly welcome Masatoshi Suzuki as the new President of ServiceNow Japan. He brings a long history of successful leadership with some of the industries most respected brands. We will elevate ServiceNow Japan to a fourth geographic region reporting directly to our proven Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Smith. And to add fuel to the growth buyer, we rolled out a new partner program to help our ecosystem drive full platform adoption of ServiceNow. We're also getting an enthusiastic reception for the company's premier global initiative RiseUp with ServiceNow. And under the thoughtful leadership of Lara Caimi, we will continue to rise up. We offer the training and certification to help people build a lifelong career working on this platform. We have never seen so much interest in the ServiceNow franchise around the world as we are seeing right now.  And from an ongoing operating perspective, we entered 2023 with much stronger sales coverage on a year-over-year basis. We have the feet on the street. We also see stronger pipeline coverage and the maturity of that pipeline, much more so than we did a year ago. The latest Glassdoor ratings feature ServiceNow as the 9th best place to work in the United States, 2nd best in the United Kingdom. The company is fully invested in all of our stated ESG objectives with our global impact report coming later this year. All this is a reflection of our proud culture built on Fred Luddy's founding vision for our company.  I was just in Las Vegas last week for our sales kick-off of them. And I can tell you, our team is fired up and ready to go for the year ahead. Really fired up. I can only reiterate that we have said consistently, there is only one way forward, and that is innovation. IDC says that by 2027, the number of digital businesses on the S&P 500 would double. Every industry is being reframed by a new paradigm or several. The participants that lean in will lead, the others will fall behind and quickly. For ServiceNow, we are committed to make the world work better for everyone. Our fundamentals are operating at peak performance, net new innovation for our customers, business impact, driving long-term stickiness of our platform and network effects, giving us a competitive moat with multiple avenues for market expansion and profitable growth with a pristine balance sheet. All in all, when people talk about cloud economics, ServiceNow is the blue chip standard. Whatever the world lacks in stability, we will more than offset with relentless execution. Our customers need to automate for cost reduction and to innovate for growth. Yes, ServiceNow helps them do both. The world works with ServiceNow as the end-to-end platform for digital transformation.  I'd like to personally thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their steadfast trust in ServiceNow. You can count on us. We're in your service, hungry and humble as ever. I'd like to now hand the call over to our CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill, and happy New Year to all of you who are listening in. Q4 was another great quarter of execution. We exceeded our subscription revenue guidance and drove strong renewal and expansion rates. Our operating and free cash flow margins also exceeded our outlook as disciplined cost management drove tailwinds to profitability.  In Q4, subscription revenues were $1.86 billion, growing 27.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 50 basis points. RPO ended the year at approximately $14 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $6.94 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth and a versus our guidance, primarily driven by favorable FX movements in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, growth was 25.5%. While constant currency cRPO growth came in just shy of our guidance of 26%, we actually outperformed our target for net new ACV and renewal ACV for contracts expiring in the quarter. The delta came from fewer early 2023 renewals than is typical in the fourth quarter.  Given our strong renewal rates, which remain the best-in-class 98% in Q4, this is only a timing issue. We expect these customers to ultimately renew upon contract expirations, providing opportunities to drive further expansion throughout 2023. The timing of early renewals does not impact 2023 subscription revenue growth, only RPO. Net new ACV would drives incremental revenue growth, and there, we exceeded our forecast. Our larger-than-average Q4 customer cohort not only renewed at a very strong rate, net expansion also remained robust. What's more, the strength in net new ACV wasn\u2019t limited to existing customers. New customer net new ACV grew over 30%.  We ended the quarter with 1,637 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail and hospitality and transportation and logistics saw net new ACV growth of well over 100% year-over-year. Government remained strong, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Manufacturing and financial services also saw healthy double-digit growth. We closed 126 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including 2 of our top 5 largest ever. In addition, we saw 100% increases in the number of both $5 million plus and 10 million-plus net new ACV deals. More and more customers are seeing the true power of the ServiceNow portfolio as a unified platform. That's leading to more multiproduct deals in Q4, 5 of our top 10 deals contain 10 or more products.  Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 28%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management and less-than-expected FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 53%, up 650 basis points year-over-year. For full year 2022, operating margin was 26%, 100 basis points above our guidance and free cash flow margin was 30%, also 100 basis points above our guidance. Total free cash flow for 2022 was a robust $2.2 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $6.4 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability.  Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing. Heading into 2023, we believe we have prudently factored in the evolving macro crosswinds into our guidance. Overall, the demand environment remains healthy, deals getting done, the market opportunity is growing, the ecosystem is expanding, our renewal and net expansion rates ended the year strong, our pipeline is robust.  With that in mind, let's turn to our 2023 outlook. We expect subscription revenues between $8.44 billion and $8.5 billion, representing 22.5% to 23.5% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, reflecting the expected diminishing impact of the change in useful life of our data center equipment as well as investments to accelerate customer time to value as part of our impact offering and higher inflation. We expect operating margin of 26% as sales and marketing efficiencies are offsetting headwinds from gross margins. We expect free cash flow margin of 30%. And we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million.  For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.99 billion and $2 billion, representing 25% to 25.5% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 300 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 24% on a constant currency basis, excluding 300 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 24%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.  In conclusion, we had a strong Q4, capping a resilient year. As we enter 2023, the macro challenges many enterprises face underscore a point we have made consistently. The technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. Our unique ability to drive business model transformation while delivering efficiency gains has created durable demand for the Now Platform. Our investment strategy is a laser focus on our customers' most pressing issues, and that continuous net new innovation translates into net new business for ServiceNow. We are well positioned for 2023 and remain on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this year. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question this afternoon from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: And congratulations, everybody. Bill, we continue to hear from some of your largest partners of the great opportunity ahead in the middle office for which ServiceNow platform just seems to be ideally suited. How are customers prioritizing these opportunities right now and into this year? And how do you position yourselves particularly with partners and vertical industry solutions to best capture it? And I've got a follow-up for Gina.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. And before I answer the first question, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to officially welcome CJ Desai as our newly President and COO, who is joining me here today. and I will have him continue to join me on these calls. And I'd also like to acknowledge Gina for powering through while she's a bit under the weather, so please her voice might be a little scratchy, but her passion is on fire. So she's in good shape, but losing her voice a little bit. We've been all over the world from Davos to Vegas to here. So that's what happens when you travel a little bit. Brad, the partners and the largest partners are really doubling down on their investment with ServiceNow. And I look at it as a multifaceted situation. First, on this RiseUp with ServiceNow, we're going to train 1 million people in the ecosystem to be fully certified on the platform to ensure that we globally scale. Second, partners are teaming up with us on an industry domain basis also based on persona and mapping that back to our solution road map and naturally, everybody is all in on the platform. So the big ones are really doubling down on the platform. What's interesting, and you bring up a good point, this is for the front, the mid and the back office. And there's a next-generation ERP evolving here with things like procure-to-pay, optimizing supply chains and other things that definitely impact the middle office. But I would also say we have a great opportunity. And if you saw our new business surge in Q4, you're seeing it play out, where we're going to net new logos and drawing net new business. And I think that will be a big part of it. CJ, you may want to build on it from what you're seeing in the middle office.\nCJ Desai: But is, I would say, when we look at the engagement layer, engagement layer has been around for a long time, say, for a customer service request. So for a large financial services organization, moving the workflow from the engagement layer on, say, customer complain to the mid office where we really shine because of our interoperability of the platform and our ability to integrate the systems and to different clouds all the way to the back office. And that's what is driving the middle office acceleration, whether that's for a financial services organization, telecommunications or a health care organization.\nWilliam McDermott: Excellent. And I know, Brad, do you have the second question, I think, for Gina.\nBrad Zelnick: And congrats. I was remiss in not congratulating you, CJ. For you Gina, I appreciate the additional disclosure on net new ACV. You guys clearly had a really strong quarter for new business, which is what matters most to investors. But as we think about cRPO and what you shared with us, I mean, we're all trying to understand the customer mindset during these uncertain times. Is it fair to conclude that perhaps there was less of a traditional Q4 IT budget flush in 2023? And if not, what else would be the rationale as to why you would see that phenomenon?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, of course, Brad. Thanks for the question and apologies for my throat. So I think what you're seeing is early renewals were always correlated and still always correlated to net new ACV. And when people early renew, it's really about co-terming multiple contracts. And certainly, in the current environment, when -- I don't know if you want to say it's less budget flush or just more tightening of budgets, the need or the desire to co-term the contract is a little bit less than what we've seen historically. Not altogether surprising given the current macro. It's why I wanted to be really clear about the fact that early renewals have no impact on future revenue, right? And in the quarter, our target forecast for net new ACV as well as renewal ACV within the quarter actually overachieved, which is why we were able to come out with a strong 2023 revenue guide and why we feel good about not only the Q4 results, but also the position that we stand in the market as well entering 2023.\nOperator: We go next now to Raimo Lenschow at Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well, and Gina, I hope you feel better soon. A quick question. If you think about the different pockets of growth, you saw this quarter that the HR and CRM part was a little bit stronger for Q4. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers? Because like ITSM, ITOM, you're kind of the #1 player. And the other ones you're expanding. So it's nice to see the expansion in them. And then I had one follow-up for Gina.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes, I'll make the first point, Raimo. And then I think CJ can actually even give you some customer examples that might be helpful. We have become the platform for digital transformation, and that's an end-to-end platform for digital transformation. So what you're seeing now is a company that has evolved from IT to the employee experience to customer service management. And obviously, the low code platform and how the creative workflow is exploding is demonstrated in our outstanding results and our very strong guide. So we're really now a platform company with a multiproduct approach to helping every customer in the industry they operate in, based on the persona we're discussing business with and ultimately, it's that completeness of vision now that has made us one of -- about a handful of companies in the entire world that really matter in the enterprise. CJ, you've got some examples you want to talk about?\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. So employee experience and employee productivity are two sides of the same coin. And with our HR service delivery product that is resonating really well, whether it's in commercial markets, including we had a very strong public sector performance as Gina outlined, where that product is resonating. And during this macroeconomic times, when you think about customer service, you want to hold on to your customers and you want to serve them profitability. That's what is driving business for our customer service management product. So we are seeing that despite the technology foundation where IT is the business, digital services other business which is what driving our ITSM and ITOM product lines and what we call service operations, picking the best of service management and operations management, but HR and our customer service management are also driving growth in very specific industries from telco to public sector and health care.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. That was very clear. And then the Gina one for you quickly, on the margin and cash flow outperformance. Can you talk a little bit about factors that we should consider in terms of timing, et cetera, that might have impacted this more, will we kind of don't want to extrapolate into next year, et cetera.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. It's a great question, Raimo. So I gave a good strong guide for operating margin as well as free cash flow margin for 2023. I think what you saw in Q4 from an operating margin perspective was continued discipline on the cost side, as you have seen us do and as you will consistently see us do. On the free cash flow side, obviously, that disciplined cost management flows through. But also, we did see some CapEx spend come through towards the tail end of Q4, which means that the payments are not due until Q1 of '23. So that does drive a little bit of headwind on the free cash flow margin in '23, which is why you see the guide that I gave. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: We go next now to Sterling Auty at MoffettNathanson.\nSterling Auty: Just want to circle back on the cRPO. Given the constant currency was 25.5%, is more of the issue that you described more happening internationally than in the U.S.? And how should we think about kind of the appetite to do renewals? And is there any concern about expansions from some of those international customers here in the first part of '23?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Surely, it has nothing to do with the renewal dynamics internationally versus domestic. The difference between the constant currency growth and nominal growth really just has to do with FX rates that moved within the quarter. So no real differences internationally versus the Americas on the renewal side of things. With respect to the early renewals, what I would point to is the strong net new ACV growth in Q4 tells you. And by the way, very strong expansion rate in Q4 tells you that customers are not changing their behaviors with respect to renewals, on-time renewals or with net new expansion. What you're just seeing is a little bit of the lack of meeting to do co-terms and bring things forward in the current macro. Again, with 98% renewal rates across the board, we remain as positive as ever that not only will we continue to expand in '23, as you've seen us do in '22, but also continue to renew those best-in-class renewal rates.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Karl at UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Sorry for asking you use your voice again. But how are you feeling about the 2024 targets? I think the consensus to you is that the $11 billion might be a little bit of a stretch given that you've had to absorb a pretty heavy FX headwind. The operating margin target of 27% seems doable. But when I look at your free cash flow target of 33%, that would be a 300 bps improvement in calendar '25. So that one feels like a little bit of a push. Do you mind just commenting on those targets, much appreciated.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Great question, Karl. What I would say is, overall, the underlying growth that we're seeing remains healthy. FX headwinds have eased slightly, but certainly are still material. And with the uncertain macro backdrop, we're going to continue to monitor the market and provide an update on our long-term targets at our Analyst Day in May. So I'd say, again, underlying demand, really strong; operating margin, well on the trajectory to hit 27%; with respect to top line and free cash flow, with the impact of FX, and that keeps moving along, we'll update those targets for you in May. But let's go back to what Bill talked about earlier. We remain very well positioned given the current macro environment. We are the platform of choice for digital transformation. And that opportunity is -- has not changed. If anything, it continues to grow.\nOperator: We'll hear next now from Mark Murphy of JP Morgan.\nMark Murphy: Bill, just given your comments on the pipeline coverage and also the maturity, would you say that the macro headwinds have actually dissipated somewhat if you compare it back to the summer? Or -- are those winds still blowing fairly steadily, but you're just able to kind of navigate through them through will power and execution rigor?\nWilliam McDermott: Yes, Mark, thank you very much for the question. I did call it out. I think maybe we were the first ones to call it out that there were some clouds on the horizon back then with the macro, and we all know the forces that were blowing between Ukraine, inflation, tightening monetary policies and supply chain dislocation, and everyone sees that to a halt so we don't need to go there. I think what happened back then is most businesses were not ready for that market. And we immediately revamped our go-to-market in the way we approached the customer because we knew the customer would have to do more with less, automate their business, take cost out and improve productivity per person.  And the work wasn't going to go away. It still had to be done, and step ServiceNow's platform. And then we also knew at the same time that CEOs, 98% of them, this is a fact have a digital-first strategy. Worried about the other 2%, but I'm good with the 98% because that makes a lot of sense. And we also knew that they weren't going to give up on their digital business dreams and they would be investing to reorient business models, as Gina said and think differently about their enterprise, which CJ's example underscored and growth would still remain on the agenda. It's just a question of what equilibrium between growth and cost takeout would be necessary for them to achieve their goals. The good thing is, with ServiceNow's platform, you could say yes to both.  And you don't have to make that choice. So what I see in the market, I see commodity tech that was at the peak of the hype cycle during the pandemic being dialed down or eliminated. And I see that investment freeing up to platforms that actually matter. So I do think our circumstances are actually improving because of this particular macro, because it's well known now that ServiceNow can take the cost down, if that's what you need immediately. And given the layoffs that we're seeing and the stories that we're reading, I clearly see that our company is rising accordingly. And I see that in the pipeline. I see that in the maturity of the pipeline which is a really important fact. And this year, we came in with sales productivity at least 20% better than I had at the start of last year based on the feet on the street and the readiness of those feets because they've been well trained and certified to do their job. All these forces are coming together in a way that gives me a feeling the market will be on our side, but our executional excellence will never have to rely on the weather conditions. We're ready.\nMark Murphy: Very clear. And Gina, sorry again giving your voice. But just again, on the topic of the lower mix of early renewals from 2023, should we interpret it at all as customers may be a little hesitant to renew early just because of the cost of capital is higher. They want to hang on to cash a little longer? Or on the flip side, is there some element of maybe you actually enjoyed the luxury of not having to encourage as many early renewals because you did see so much strength on the new logo side?\nGina Mastantuono: A great point, Mark. And certainly, I think you're seeing a little bit of both. And what I keep telling folks is the fact that we are not having to rely on early renewals as much as we've done in the past, shows the resilience and the strength and the power of the Now Platform. But yes, I also think that in this market, people are holding on to cash a little bit longer. And that's not altogether surprising either.\nWilliam McDermott: And Mark, one thing I would just build on what Gina is saying, and for every investor out there, when you don't need to rely on early renewals, that means you have a competitive advantage with your technology. It also means that you're able to preserve your pricing power as you go into the renewal cycles on the normal terms. So this is actually a super healthy thing, and that's why the guide for 2023 was above all the consensus estimates that you guys have.\nOperator: The next map to Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: I would think that in a time of inflationary environments that people would want to get rid of cash and preserve the purchasing power. But anyways, a little counterintuitive. That was not my question anyway. So congratulations, first of all, Bill, CJ and Gina. I will spare you. I'll give you some time off and not ask you a question, so you can rest your voice. Bill, one thing that occurs to me is that you've scaled a very successful technology company before. So what are the patterns that you see at this point of the evolution of ServiceNow there could be so many things that you could be doing from differently, from a go-to-market perspective, verticalizing the product, expanded distribution partnerships with resellers potentially. There's so much innovation. I look at the number of products that you have, it's mind blowing. Almost complex. How do you ensure that this all does not get in the way of your mission to build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century? How do you make these catalysts and tailwinds and make ensure that nothing gets in the way since you've especially seen this pattern play out and you've successfully done this before?\nWilliam McDermott: Yes, absolutely. Yes, Kash, as I said, we've been through this movie before, and I'd like to show. So here's the situation. We're keeping it real simple for 22,000 of our closest friends within ServiceNow and for our partners. We have the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. That platform is applicable to each industry and every persona within the enterprise. And we are going to expand that across the world. And you saw the move we made with Japan. Our ambitions are going to India, to the Middle East and many other places. So end-to-end platform, by industry, persona and geo, and we kept it very simple for our colleagues and also our partners. We focused on net new innovation. We will build the future. We have the best engineering leader and the best engineering team in the industry, hard stop. We have an incredible go-to-market machine, and we're betting on ourselves. So we're going to keep a real simple around net new innovation and net new ACV. That's it. And with a loyal customer base that will remain ever loyal with many upsells, cross-sells and same account revenue growth, if you get new business on top of that because you're building the best product in the world, you're going to have the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century.\nOperator: We go next now to Peter Weed at Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: And congratulations on the performance, particularly on the net new ACV. In fact, that's what I'd love to help -- a little bit help unpacking that because obviously, it's including both new logos and expansion. And I think we heard last quarter and correct me if I'm wrong, that new customer acquisition had slowed relative to, say, Q2 where I think for new revenue, you had talked about maybe 10% of growth was coming from new customers. When you look forward now and looking forward to next year and the revenue growth, are you seeing most of that growth coming from existing customers relative to what you would have normally done with new customers, I guess, is part of the question. And then the other side of the question is it appears that NRR declined by about 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter and in your guide, it would anticipate continuing decline in NRR by probably another 300 basis points to hit your guide. What is really creating that weakness in the kind of the renewal NRR relative to recent quarters that have been pretty consistently at or above 130%?\nGina Mastantuono: Peter, I'll take the first question. So clearly, we're thrilled with the net new ACV growth that we're seeing, and not only are our expansion rates strong within the quarter and for the full year in 2022, we were really, really pleased to see that new customer, net new ACV grew over 30% year-over-year despite the headwinds. And we've talked about this in the past. We've really evolved our focus away from the number and the volume of new customers to landing the right new customers that can land with us and expand with us over time. And so the fact that these new lands are growing is testament to the platform, a testament to the breadth of products on the platform. And so as we think about 2023 and beyond, we absolutely expect to continue to see very strong expansion rates as well as good new logo growth. But again, it's about not the volume of those new logos, but the quality. And really, you can see that in our results. With respect to your comment on NRR declining by 300 basis points, that's not what we're seeing. I'm not sure what math you're doing, but I'm sure that off-line, Darren can talk you through it. But our net retention rate and expansion rate remains very strong in Q4 and for the whole year in 2022.\nOperator: We go next to now to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: And very nice end to the year with that new business growth there. Gina, I wanted to dig in on gross margins a little bit. I'm still trying to wrap my head around a 200 basis point decline. We haven't seen 84% subscription gross margins in ServiceNow since 2016, if I'm looking on my model correctly, I believe. You told us last year at this time that there's still an incremental 50 basis points of tailwind that you can get from the accounting change on useful life. So there's somewhere a 250 basis point offset that's driving down gross margins. Can you help us understand what that is, a little bit better? What's that added expense that had such a weight on gross margin heading into FY '23?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Great question, Keith. So first of all, your math is a little off, right? So we had in 2021, we had 85% gross margin, and then this year, 86%. And we talked about that 100 basis points being the change in depreciation life of our assets. And we've said that 100 basis points was going to come down to 50, right? So you take 86, you come off to 50, that gives you 85.5. And so what you're seeing, what I tried to call out in my script is, number one, we are seeing impacts of inflation, right, not surprising, and we've talked about. But also, we are also investing heavily in ensuring that our customers are getting to success in getting to implementation much faster with respect to our impact products. And so very conscious investment decisions being made there, offset by sales and marketing efficiencies that you've come to expect from us, which is why the operating margin guide remains absolutely where you would have expected to be because we're making investments in cost of sales to get our customers to implementation as a value faster, offset by the sales and marketing efficiencies.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: Congrats, CJ. Congrats guys on a solid quarter. I guess, we're all trying to unpack, I think, 2 metrics that would be very, very helpful from the quarter itself. So apologies for the more financial-oriented question. But Gina, can you quantify the renewal headwind from the -- from the smaller early renewals? And can you comment on the net retention rate itself? Was it still 125 for the full year? Because when you take a step back, it looks like the cRPO guide for Q1 is a lot stronger than where people thought it would be, which implies that maybe that renewal headwind becomes a tailwind if you get those renewals or maybe you've got them already in the quarter. And the guide for the full year, to your point, is I think, a lot stronger than what people realize. So we're all trying to kind of piece together that -- those 2 dynamics and questions.\nGina Mastantuono: I won't quantify the exact renewal headwind. But what I would say is that if not for the early renewals, we would have beat our cRPO guide. And with respect to the NRR, while we don't comment on exact numbers, it was absolutely consistent and relatively close to the 125 that you quote.\nAleksandr Zukin: Perfect. Super helpful. And I guess maybe a technical one or a product-oriented one for you, Bill or CJ. With respect to some of the other new areas of innovation that you're bringing to bear, particularly in industries going forward. Can you maybe highlight some early anecdotes and examples of kind of some of the larger customer wins and verticals that give you confidence to kind of pour gas on the fire there?\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. So great to hear from you, Alex. I would say one of the products that we verticalized pretty early on was in the telco media and tech. -- back in -- started building that in 2019, seeing very strong traction, everything from order management to mid office to back office in telcos. And that product line which was created for that industry is now at top 10 telcos and continue to win market share and displace multiple systems, whether it's a telco company or a media company. Similarly, the public sector, we created a product for public sector as well as health care that is seeing strong traction as well. And overall, between the new products, horizontal products like we have done in the world of ERP on procure to pay or supplier life cycle management, combined that with some of these new industry products, we are winning 7-figure deals, sometimes much larger and having massive traction in that specific where customers are actually going live in 3 to 4 months.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you, Alex. By the way, CJ had one go live yesterday with 50,000 agents, and we were in the board room together as we were watching the go live and it was flawless. So that's a customer service management example for one of the most prestigious brands in the world. So you can count on our customer service management business to continue to rock the house. So we're ready to go. And by the way, I don't get caught up in the cRPO thing because it's only a forecasting based on prior year assumptions, has nothing to do with what actually happened. The net new business was fantastic. And all those renewals are sitting for us in 2023. And obviously, because we're delivering business value and impact, it is sitting there for us at the right pricing structure. So it's actually a super good thing from a shareholder value creation perspective.\nOperator: We can go next now to Brad Reback at Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Bill, last week, you spoke pretty adamantly about continuing to hire. Hiring net new downtick a little bit here in 4Q versus the previous few quarters. Maybe you can give us an idea of what the plan is for this year.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. As Gina said, we're going to be very intentional about how we manage the headcount in the corporation. We are protecting this house as a primary objective. And we have invested very heavily now for the last 3.5 years, for sure, on headcount. And we have what we need. Where we are investing, and we'll continue to invest, primarily will be coders, people that actually write the code and also people that are actually responsible for the customer relationship and carry a quota. So we're going to be very, very intentional. And I'm really super because we're in great shape on our workforce. We have really happy workforce. Our retention rates are better than ever. The Glassdoor ranking speaks to some of that. So what we are finding is because of our intentionality, we're getting 9s and 10s in here, and the people we are choosing to hire come from a pool of thousands and thousands and only the best get to go to ServiceNow. And I think that's going to build an even stronger ServiceNow going forward. So no problem with the workforce. Everything is about driving innovation or net new ACV, net new innovation, net new ACV. That's the ball game.\nGina Mastantuono: If I could just add, we're entering 2023, and Bill alluded to this earlier, we're entering 2023 with significantly more ramp reps than we entered into '22. So that growth. Yes, we might have had a little bit of a slowdown in hiring in Q4, but that was not on quota-bearing sales or engineering. We're entering 2023 from a ramp reps perspective, very strong, which gives us confidence not only with the pipeline we're seeing, but with the productivity that we'll get out of those ramp ups.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Keith Bachman of BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Gina, I hope you feel better. Question and a clarification. First, a clarification. It was an impressive metric you provided on the net new customer ACV growth of 30%. Can you just for context, can you give us what that same number would have been last year in the December quarter or an average over the last 2 years in the December quarter? I'm just trying to see what the calibration point is. And then my question, it relates to the upsell. And in particular, on ITOMs and ITSM, in the past, you provided updates on kind of the SKU mix, in other words, going to Pro to Enterprise. If you could just give us an update on -- is that slowing up at all given the economy or are customers kind of forging ahead and just where are -- if you could give us an update on the transition. That's it for me.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, Keith, I'll tell you that 30% net new ACV -- net new customer ACV growth, we're really proud of in the quarter. We haven't given those metrics in prior quarters. Suffice it to say that we continue to see those net new customer ACVs growing as we are landing larger deals with new customers. And those new customers are able to expand with us more. So really strong growth in the quarter, but we've not consistently given that, but to say that we are continuing to see that grow. With respect to ITSM Pro, we've talked about penetration being at about 35%, and that continues to do well.\nKeith Bachman: And so does that continue to move higher Gina for the year? Or is that kind of -- is there any pressure on that stalling out at all in terms of customers willing to mix up?\nGina Mastantuono: It has continued to grow. We don't give that percentage every single quarter. We'll give it every time it hits the next five if that makes sense. But we absolutely are seeing Pro penetration continuing. CJ, I don't know if you want to add any\nCJ Desai: Absolutely, Keith. Here is what I can say. So the number continues to increase since we launched this -- and what was super encouraging in Q4 was that some of the new logos that we got with ITSM also landed with ITSM Pro besides our existing cohort upgrading to ITSM Pro. So 35%, we are currently very, very optimistic. And at Financial Analyst Day, we will provide bigger updates on what's happening with ITSM Pro and Enterprise.\nOperator: We will go to Tyler Radke at Citi.\nTyler Radke: Maybe for Bill or CJ, just given the widespread conversations around cloud optimizations as we heard from Microsoft last night, can you just talk about how you're approaching these conversations with your customers? Are there specific products that you're leading with? And then CJ, just I would love to get an update on your view on the ServiceNow observability strategy heading into 2023? Kind of what are your key milestones from a product perspective? And how is just the progress gone since the most recent acquisition?\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. So let's first start with the cloud optimization question. Listen, our product line since day 1, whether you look at ITSM, ITOM or asset management, our ability to discover assets whether they are an on-prem cloud, private cloud, public cloud or multi-cloud has continued to be best-in-class. So we help our customer, they\u2019re trying to optimize their power spend. That's great. If they're trying to move to public cloud and they want to accelerate that journey, that's great too. So our portfolio is best suited for meeting our customers where they are on that cloud journey and where they want to go. So I feel actually pretty good in terms of just our portfolio's relevance in this multi-cloud and how our different product lines can help them with their acceleration and optimization. And on observability, what was really encouraging for me in Q4 is that we had 3 of Fortune 100 companies decided to buy ServiceNow Observability solution and Lightstep at a meaningful scale. And these are real workloads that are really being monitored by our Lightstep solution. And as I think about 2023 milestones, as you know, that Tyler we bought company called Era, which provides log management solution. We will fully integrate that in our Observability platform. So we have not only primary observability solution, but also unified observability solutions that work across multi-states. So very optimistic going into '23.\nOperator: We do have time for one more question this afternoon. We'll take that now from Sarah Bowler at Macquarie Capital.\nSarah Bowler: Congrats to CJ, wonderful to see. Really, I think just given that you're operating in this, what feels like rarefied air, let me sort of flip things over a little bit and ask if there were any verticals that you haven't called out or regions in particular where you saw any softness or perhaps extra layers of scrutiny on overall spending?\nCJ Desai: So I will say, I'm going to take this, Sarah. Thank you very much. But overall, we feel very balanced performance. Gina called out certain verticals super proud of what we did in public sector. Typically, in Q3, we are expected to do well in public sector. But even in Q4, we did really well and as Gina called out 50% growth. So whether it's public sector, whether it's retail, whether it's health care and others, very balanced performance and strong growth, an amazing quarter. I would say, as Bill just touched on, we are really excited about our growth potential in Japan and India. And with new appointment in Japan and Japan being the core geography according to Paul Smith, Chief Commercial Officer, is somewhere we really want to pay attention to, and we are very optimistic on the market side there.\nOperator: And again, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to thank you all for joining today's ServiceNow Q4 2022 earnings conference call. Again, that will bring us to end today's call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great afternoon. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. ServiceNow continues to perform as-the-beyond expectations company. For Q4, we beat guidance with subscription revenue growth of 27.5% in constant currency. Operating margin was 28%, 2 points above our guidance. Our free cash flow margin was 30%, 1 point above our guidance. We had 126 deals greater than $1 million in Q4, including our largest deals ever worldwide in EMEA and in Latin America. Our 98% renewal rate remains the industry benchmark. With 25.5% constant currency cRPO growth, we actually had better-than-expected new business in Q4 with less reliance on early renewals. Based on this new business surge, we are giving a very strong guidance for 2023. Our guidance reflects a disciplined forecast that appropriately balances our well-founded optimism for ServiceNow's business. We'll work hard to go beyond it, and we'll begin that march in Q1.  Here is the main takeaway. Even in a complex operating environment, ServiceNow is executing at the rule of 58.5%. We are driving net new innovation, fast growth and operating leverage. ServiceNow is the proverbial safe harbor in all weather conditions.  Let me unpack the current environment for you. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation aren't going anywhere. IDC's research makes a clear that technology budgets are growing. They forecast IT spend will grow 5% in 2023, software spend at 8% and Software-as-a-Service spend at 15%. So as businesses increase spend, the only question then is where will all that investment go? And this answer has everything to do with the great reprioritization. The theme in Davos this year was cooperation in a fragmented world. It all begins with a fragmented enterprise. C-level buyers don't want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, \"We can't afford 1,000 points of dim light. We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.\" So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow.  This begins with our business model. ServiceNow was born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world. Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation. ServiceNow has natively embedded the complete tool set from AI to RPA to process mining in our platform. Now professional developers and the rest of us, real people like you and me, can build mission-critical applications to automate the world of work. Everything culminates with real business outcomes.  ServiceNow integrates the enterprise to deliver better customer service, employee experiences, security, risk management and next-generation business processes like Procure to Pay, technology foundation, hyper automation, process orchestration. With this completeness of vision, ServiceNow is the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. If all we did was help existing customers consume everything this platform can do, we would stay a fast-growth company. But of course, our strategy goes well beyond this as does our proven ability to execute.  Right now, many technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage. It also allowed us to continue hiring, especially in engineering and quota-carrying roles. The results tell the story. ITSM was in 14 of our top 20 deals, with 15 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 16 of the top 20, with 14 deals over $1 million. Security and Risk Solutions were at 13 of the top 20, with 9 deals over $1 million. Customer workflows were in 13 of the top 20, with 13 deals over $1 million. Employee workflows were 13 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million. And create workloads were in 19 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million.  We saw new business growth, new logos and major expansions with some of our existing customers. The United States Army expanded its ServiceNow road map well beyond IT. ServiceNow will improve the Army's ability to consolidate service management for its over 1 million active military contractor and civilian population. The Schwarz Group, one of the world's top retailers will digitize its 11,000 stores from retail locations to logistics on ServiceNow as its digital business platform. This transition is a transformation and it will position the Schwarz Group at the forefront of the next-generation retail industry. From Banco do Brasil, to AT&T, to Sumitomo, we have countless stories that span ServiceNow's workflows, Lightstep, geographic regions and industries across the board, we're winning. And as you'll hear from Gina, we grew new business 100% year-over-year across retail, hospitality, transportation and logistics. That's only one example. And with the expansion of ServiceNow's impact, we are setting the standard for speed of deployment and business value for our customers.  More than three years ago, I stated our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And this is an ambition I will see through to its full completion. Following my elevation of Chairman and CEO, I'm delighted to announce that CJ Desai has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. CJ is the leader of consequence, well known in the industry. His track record in ServiceNow speaks for itself from strengthening our platform to driving our customer experience. This is exactly how we are orchestrating our company to perform on an end-to-end basis from innovation to execution with our customers. And I'd like to personally congratulate CJ for his latest well-deserved endorsement of his leadership. Congratulations, CJ.  In other news, we proudly welcome Masatoshi Suzuki as the new President of ServiceNow Japan. He brings a long history of successful leadership with some of the industries most respected brands. We will elevate ServiceNow Japan to a fourth geographic region reporting directly to our proven Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Smith. And to add fuel to the growth buyer, we rolled out a new partner program to help our ecosystem drive full platform adoption of ServiceNow. We're also getting an enthusiastic reception for the company's premier global initiative RiseUp with ServiceNow. And under the thoughtful leadership of Lara Caimi, we will continue to rise up. We offer the training and certification to help people build a lifelong career working on this platform. We have never seen so much interest in the ServiceNow franchise around the world as we are seeing right now.  And from an ongoing operating perspective, we entered 2023 with much stronger sales coverage on a year-over-year basis. We have the feet on the street. We also see stronger pipeline coverage and the maturity of that pipeline, much more so than we did a year ago. The latest Glassdoor ratings feature ServiceNow as the 9th best place to work in the United States, 2nd best in the United Kingdom. The company is fully invested in all of our stated ESG objectives with our global impact report coming later this year. All this is a reflection of our proud culture built on Fred Luddy's founding vision for our company.  I was just in Las Vegas last week for our sales kick-off of them. And I can tell you, our team is fired up and ready to go for the year ahead. Really fired up. I can only reiterate that we have said consistently, there is only one way forward, and that is innovation. IDC says that by 2027, the number of digital businesses on the S&P 500 would double. Every industry is being reframed by a new paradigm or several. The participants that lean in will lead, the others will fall behind and quickly. For ServiceNow, we are committed to make the world work better for everyone. Our fundamentals are operating at peak performance, net new innovation for our customers, business impact, driving long-term stickiness of our platform and network effects, giving us a competitive moat with multiple avenues for market expansion and profitable growth with a pristine balance sheet. All in all, when people talk about cloud economics, ServiceNow is the blue chip standard. Whatever the world lacks in stability, we will more than offset with relentless execution. Our customers need to automate for cost reduction and to innovate for growth. Yes, ServiceNow helps them do both. The world works with ServiceNow as the end-to-end platform for digital transformation.  I'd like to personally thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their steadfast trust in ServiceNow. You can count on us. We're in your service, hungry and humble as ever. I'd like to now hand the call over to our CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. And before I answer the first question, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to officially welcome CJ Desai as our newly President and COO, who is joining me here today. and I will have him continue to join me on these calls. And I'd also like to acknowledge Gina for powering through while she's a bit under the weather, so please her voice might be a little scratchy, but her passion is on fire. So she's in good shape, but losing her voice a little bit. We've been all over the world from Davos to Vegas to here. So that's what happens when you travel a little bit. Brad, the partners and the largest partners are really doubling down on their investment with ServiceNow. And I look at it as a multifaceted situation. First, on this RiseUp with ServiceNow, we're going to train 1 million people in the ecosystem to be fully certified on the platform to ensure that we globally scale. Second, partners are teaming up with us on an industry domain basis also based on persona and mapping that back to our solution road map and naturally, everybody is all in on the platform. So the big ones are really doubling down on the platform. What's interesting, and you bring up a good point, this is for the front, the mid and the back office. And there's a next-generation ERP evolving here with things like procure-to-pay, optimizing supply chains and other things that definitely impact the middle office. But I would also say we have a great opportunity. And if you saw our new business surge in Q4, you're seeing it play out, where we're going to net new logos and drawing net new business. And I think that will be a big part of it. CJ, you may want to build on it from what you're seeing in the middle office. Excellent. And I know, Brad, do you have the second question, I think, for Gina. Yes, I'll make the first point, Raimo. And then I think CJ can actually even give you some customer examples that might be helpful. We have become the platform for digital transformation, and that's an end-to-end platform for digital transformation. So what you're seeing now is a company that has evolved from IT to the employee experience to customer service management. And obviously, the low code platform and how the creative workflow is exploding is demonstrated in our outstanding results and our very strong guide. So we're really now a platform company with a multiproduct approach to helping every customer in the industry they operate in, based on the persona we're discussing business with and ultimately, it's that completeness of vision now that has made us one of -- about a handful of companies in the entire world that really matter in the enterprise. CJ, you've got some examples you want to talk about? Yes, Mark, thank you very much for the question. I did call it out. I think maybe we were the first ones to call it out that there were some clouds on the horizon back then with the macro, and we all know the forces that were blowing between Ukraine, inflation, tightening monetary policies and supply chain dislocation, and everyone sees that to a halt so we don't need to go there. I think what happened back then is most businesses were not ready for that market. And we immediately revamped our go-to-market in the way we approached the customer because we knew the customer would have to do more with less, automate their business, take cost out and improve productivity per person.  And the work wasn't going to go away. It still had to be done, and step ServiceNow's platform. And then we also knew at the same time that CEOs, 98% of them, this is a fact have a digital-first strategy. Worried about the other 2%, but I'm good with the 98% because that makes a lot of sense. And we also knew that they weren't going to give up on their digital business dreams and they would be investing to reorient business models, as Gina said and think differently about their enterprise, which CJ's example underscored and growth would still remain on the agenda. It's just a question of what equilibrium between growth and cost takeout would be necessary for them to achieve their goals. The good thing is, with ServiceNow's platform, you could say yes to both.  And you don't have to make that choice. So what I see in the market, I see commodity tech that was at the peak of the hype cycle during the pandemic being dialed down or eliminated. And I see that investment freeing up to platforms that actually matter. So I do think our circumstances are actually improving because of this particular macro, because it's well known now that ServiceNow can take the cost down, if that's what you need immediately. And given the layoffs that we're seeing and the stories that we're reading, I clearly see that our company is rising accordingly. And I see that in the pipeline. I see that in the maturity of the pipeline which is a really important fact. And this year, we came in with sales productivity at least 20% better than I had at the start of last year based on the feet on the street and the readiness of those feets because they've been well trained and certified to do their job. All these forces are coming together in a way that gives me a feeling the market will be on our side, but our executional excellence will never have to rely on the weather conditions. We're ready. And Mark, one thing I would just build on what Gina is saying, and for every investor out there, when you don't need to rely on early renewals, that means you have a competitive advantage with your technology. It also means that you're able to preserve your pricing power as you go into the renewal cycles on the normal terms. So this is actually a super healthy thing, and that's why the guide for 2023 was above all the consensus estimates that you guys have. Yes, absolutely. Yes, Kash, as I said, we've been through this movie before, and I'd like to show. So here's the situation. We're keeping it real simple for 22,000 of our closest friends within ServiceNow and for our partners. We have the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. That platform is applicable to each industry and every persona within the enterprise. And we are going to expand that across the world. And you saw the move we made with Japan. Our ambitions are going to India, to the Middle East and many other places. So end-to-end platform, by industry, persona and geo, and we kept it very simple for our colleagues and also our partners. We focused on net new innovation. We will build the future. We have the best engineering leader and the best engineering team in the industry, hard stop. We have an incredible go-to-market machine, and we're betting on ourselves. So we're going to keep a real simple around net new innovation and net new ACV. That's it. And with a loyal customer base that will remain ever loyal with many upsells, cross-sells and same account revenue growth, if you get new business on top of that because you're building the best product in the world, you're going to have the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. Thank you, Alex. By the way, CJ had one go live yesterday with 50,000 agents, and we were in the board room together as we were watching the go live and it was flawless. So that's a customer service management example for one of the most prestigious brands in the world. So you can count on our customer service management business to continue to rock the house. So we're ready to go. And by the way, I don't get caught up in the cRPO thing because it's only a forecasting based on prior year assumptions, has nothing to do with what actually happened. The net new business was fantastic. And all those renewals are sitting for us in 2023. And obviously, because we're delivering business value and impact, it is sitting there for us at the right pricing structure. So it's actually a super good thing from a shareholder value creation perspective. Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. As Gina said, we're going to be very intentional about how we manage the headcount in the corporation. We are protecting this house as a primary objective. And we have invested very heavily now for the last 3.5 years, for sure, on headcount. And we have what we need. Where we are investing, and we'll continue to invest, primarily will be coders, people that actually write the code and also people that are actually responsible for the customer relationship and carry a quota. So we're going to be very, very intentional. And I'm really super because we're in great shape on our workforce. We have really happy workforce. Our retention rates are better than ever. The Glassdoor ranking speaks to some of that. So what we are finding is because of our intentionality, we're getting 9s and 10s in here, and the people we are choosing to hire come from a pool of thousands and thousands and only the best get to go to ServiceNow. And I think that's going to build an even stronger ServiceNow going forward. So no problem with the workforce. Everything is about driving innovation or net new ACV, net new innovation, net new ACV. That's the ball game."

We exceeded our subscription revenue guidance and drove strong renewal and expansion rates. Our operating and free cash flow margins also exceeded our outlook as disciplined cost management drove tailwinds to profitability.  In Q4, subscription revenues were $1.86 billion, growing 27.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 50 basis points. RPO ended the year at approximately $14 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $6.94 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth and a versus our guidance, primarily driven by favorable FX movements in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, growth was 25.5%. While constant currency cRPO growth came in just shy of our guidance of 26%, we actually outperformed our target for net new ACV and renewal ACV for contracts expiring in the quarter. The delta came from fewer early 2023 renewals than is typical in the fourth quarter.  Given our strong renewal rates, which remain the best-in-class 98% in Q4, this is only a timing issue. We expect these customers to ultimately renew upon contract expirations, providing opportunities to drive further expansion throughout 2023. The timing of early renewals does not impact 2023 subscription revenue growth, only RPO. Net new ACV would drives incremental revenue growth, and there, we exceeded our forecast. Our larger-than-average Q4 customer cohort not only renewed at a very strong rate, net expansion also remained robust. What's more, the strength in net new ACV wasn't limited to existing customers. New customer net new ACV grew over 30%.  We ended the quarter with 1,637 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail and hospitality and transportation and logistics saw net new ACV growth of well over 100% year-over-year. Government remained strong, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Manufacturing and financial services also saw healthy double-digit growth. We closed 126 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including 2 of our top 5 largest ever. In addition, we saw 100% increases in the number of both $5 million plus and 10 million-plus net new ACV deals. More and more customers are seeing the true power of the ServiceNow portfolio as a unified platform. That's leading to more multiproduct deals in Q4, 5 of our top 10 deals contain 10 or more products.  Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 28%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management and less-than-expected FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 53%, up 650 basis points year-over-year. For full year 2022, operating margin was 26%, 100 basis points above our guidance and free cash flow margin was 30%, also 100 basis points above our guidance. Total free cash flow for 2022 was a robust $2.2 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $6.4 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability.  Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing. Heading into 2023, we believe we have prudently factored in the evolving macro crosswinds into our guidance. Overall, the demand environment remains healthy, deals getting done, the market opportunity is growing, the ecosystem is expanding, our renewal and net expansion rates ended the year strong, our pipeline is robust.  With that in mind, let's turn to our 2023 outlook. We expect subscription revenues between $8.44 billion and $8.5 billion, representing 22.5% to 23.5% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, reflecting the expected diminishing impact of the change in useful life of our data center equipment as well as investments to accelerate customer time to value as part of our impact offering and higher inflation. We expect operating margin of 26% as sales and marketing efficiencies are offsetting headwinds from gross margins. We expect free cash flow margin of 30%. And we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million.  For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.99 billion and $2 billion, representing 25% to 25.5% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 300 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 24% on a constant currency basis, excluding 300 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 24%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.  In conclusion, we had a strong Q4, capping a resilient year. As we enter 2023, the macro challenges many enterprises face underscore a point we have made consistently. The technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. Our unique ability to drive business model transformation while delivering efficiency gains has created durable demand for the Now Platform. Our investment strategy is a laser focus on our customers' most pressing issues, and that continuous net new innovation translates into net new business for ServiceNow. We are well positioned for 2023 and remain on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this year. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Yes, of course, Brad. Thanks for the question and apologies for my throat. So I think what you're seeing is early renewals were always correlated and still always correlated to net new ACV. And when people early renew, it's really about co-terming multiple contracts. And certainly, in the current environment, when -- I don't know if you want to say it's less budget flush or just more tightening of budgets, the need or the desire to co-term the contract is a little bit less than what we've seen historically. Not altogether surprising given the current macro. It's why I wanted to be really clear about the fact that early renewals have no impact on future revenue, right? And in the quarter, our target forecast for net new ACV as well as renewal ACV within the quarter actually overachieved, which is why we were able to come out with a strong 2023 revenue guide and why we feel good about not only the Q4 results, but also the position that we stand in the market as well entering 2023. Yes. It's a great question, Raimo. So I gave a good strong guide for operating margin as well as free cash flow margin for 2023. I think what you saw in Q4 from an operating margin perspective was continued discipline on the cost side, as you have seen us do and as you will consistently see us do. On the free cash flow side, obviously, that disciplined cost management flows through. But also, we did see some CapEx spend come through towards the tail end of Q4, which means that the payments are not due until Q1 of '23. So that does drive a little bit of headwind on the free cash flow margin in '23, which is why you see the guide that I gave. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. Surely, it has nothing to do with the renewal dynamics internationally versus domestic. The difference between the constant currency growth and nominal growth really just has to do with FX rates that moved within the quarter. So no real differences internationally versus the Americas on the renewal side of things. With respect to the early renewals, what I would point to is the strong net new ACV growth in Q4 tells you. And by the way, very strong expansion rate in Q4 tells you that customers are not changing their behaviors with respect to renewals, on-time renewals or with net new expansion. What you're just seeing is a little bit of the lack of meeting to do co-terms and bring things forward in the current macro. Again, with 98% renewal rates across the board, we remain as positive as ever that not only will we continue to expand in '23, as you've seen us do in '22, but also continue to renew those best-in-class renewal rates. Yes. Great question, Karl. What I would say is, overall, the underlying growth that we're seeing remains healthy. FX headwinds have eased slightly, but certainly are still material. And with the uncertain macro backdrop, we're going to continue to monitor the market and provide an update on our long-term targets at our Analyst Day in May. So I'd say, again, underlying demand, really strong; operating margin, well on the trajectory to hit 27%; with respect to top line and free cash flow, with the impact of FX, and that keeps moving along, we'll update those targets for you in May. But let's go back to what Bill talked about earlier. We remain very well positioned given the current macro environment. We are the platform of choice for digital transformation. And that opportunity is -- has not changed. If anything, it continues to grow. A great point, Mark. And certainly, I think you're seeing a little bit of both. And what I keep telling folks is the fact that we are not having to rely on early renewals as much as we've done in the past, shows the resilience and the strength and the power of the Now Platform. But yes, I also think that in this market, people are holding on to cash a little bit longer. And that's not altogether surprising either. Peter, I'll take the first question. So clearly, we're thrilled with the net new ACV growth that we're seeing, and not only are our expansion rates strong within the quarter and for the full year in 2022, we were really, really pleased to see that new customer, net new ACV grew over 30% year-over-year despite the headwinds. And we've talked about this in the past. We've really evolved our focus away from the number and the volume of new customers to landing the right new customers that can land with us and expand with us over time. And so the fact that these new lands are growing is testament to the platform, a testament to the breadth of products on the platform. And so as we think about 2023 and beyond, we absolutely expect to continue to see very strong expansion rates as well as good new logo growth. But again, it's about not the volume of those new logos, but the quality. And really, you can see that in our results. With respect to your comment on NRR declining by 300 basis points, that's not what we're seeing. I'm not sure what math you're doing, but I'm sure that off-line, Darren can talk you through it. But our net retention rate and expansion rate remains very strong in Q4 and for the whole year in 2022. Yes. Great question, Keith. So first of all, your math is a little off, right? So we had in 2021, we had 85% gross margin, and then this year, 86%. And we talked about that 100 basis points being the change in depreciation life of our assets. And we've said that 100 basis points was going to come down to 50, right? So you take 86, you come off to 50, that gives you 85.5. And so what you're seeing, what I tried to call out in my script is, number one, we are seeing impacts of inflation, right, not surprising, and we've talked about. But also, we are also investing heavily in ensuring that our customers are getting to success in getting to implementation much faster with respect to our impact products. And so very conscious investment decisions being made there, offset by sales and marketing efficiencies that you've come to expect from us, which is why the operating margin guide remains absolutely where you would have expected to be because we're making investments in cost of sales to get our customers to implementation as a value faster, offset by the sales and marketing efficiencies. I won't quantify the exact renewal headwind. But what I would say is that if not for the early renewals, we would have beat our cRPO guide. And with respect to the NRR, while we don't comment on exact numbers, it was absolutely consistent and relatively close to the 125 that you quote. If I could just add, we're entering 2023, and Bill alluded to this earlier, we're entering 2023 with significantly more ramp reps than we entered into '22. So that growth. Yes, we might have had a little bit of a slowdown in hiring in Q4, but that was not on quota-bearing sales or engineering. We're entering 2023 from a ramp reps perspective, very strong, which gives us confidence not only with the pipeline we're seeing, but with the productivity that we'll get out of those ramp ups. Yes, Keith, I'll tell you that 30% net new ACV -- net new customer ACV growth, we're really proud of in the quarter. We haven't given those metrics in prior quarters. Suffice it to say that we continue to see those net new customer ACVs growing as we are landing larger deals with new customers. And those new customers are able to expand with us more. So really strong growth in the quarter, but we've not consistently given that, but to say that we are continuing to see that grow. With respect to ITSM Pro, we've talked about penetration being at about 35%, and that continues to do well. It has continued to grow. We don't give that percentage every single quarter. We'll give it every time it hits the next five if that makes sense. But we absolutely are seeing Pro penetration continuing. CJ, I don't know if you want to add any"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDarren Yip: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our third quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call such as our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investment. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott : Thank you very much, Darren, and I'll add my welcome to everyone joining today's call. ServiceNow had an outstanding third quarter. Looking at the top line results in constant currency, subscription revenue was 28.5% growth. cRPO growth was 25%. On profitability, operating margin was 26%. All three metrics are above our guidance, beating expectations once again. ServiceNow had 69 Q3 deals greater than $1 million. Our U.S. federal business had its best quarter ever in Q3. We saw strength across industries and business segments. Our performance was consistent globally with Europe executing especially well this quarter. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 98%. We are the largest organically grown enterprise software company. We have an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale. As these Q3 results demonstrate, we fully intend to maintain this leadership position. Regarding the operating environment, in recent quarters, we said that secular tailwinds were stronger than macro crosswinds. They are. Nothing we saw in Q3 changes this core thesis. Digital technology is a deflationary force. The enterprise digital transformation market is validated. The investment thesis is stronger than ever. Hybrid multi-cloud deployments, adoption of a modern data infrastructure stack, cybersecurity and risk management, AI and data analytics, remote work and collaboration, these trends are not only durable, their relevance is expanding. There'll be 750 million new applications built by 2025. In the U.S. alone, nearly 100 million workers will remain in hybrid environments. 27 billion connected devices will drive more data in cloud over the next three years. And ServiceNow's platform directly addresses all these challenges, which translates to numerous growth vectors for our business. I hear one thing from CEOs consistently. Anything we prioritize must generate results in weeks or months. This is the essence of the great reprioritization. In past decades, waves of enterprise systems were introduced to meet market challenges of those times, operating systems, databases, applications. What we see now is a generational shift from architectures built in the last century to platforms engineered for this one. If you look at the ERP market, we see customers at various stages of their move to the cloud. Some of the world's largest manufacturers, for example, are consolidating hundreds of old procurement processes into a modern workflow experience. This declutters the legacy environment, driving more than $1 billion in cost efficiencies for just one of our many ERP wins this quarter. We could do it because ServiceNow was born in the cloud. We integrate with everyone. We meet our customers wherever they are, any environment, any organizational structure, any operating model. Where there is complexity, we simplify. We are fast to deploy, fast to generate ROI. In this need for speed environment, the ServiceNow Platform is becoming the strategic center of gravity for our customers. In light of this, today, we're announcing a new initiative: RiseUp with ServiceNow to skill 1 million ServiceNow certified professionals by 2024. Our customers, partners and ServiceNow itself are all growing as ServiceNow workforces. We see opportunity everywhere. With RiseUp with ServiceNow, we'll give people the knowledge to seize it. Overall, the demand environment is strong. The market opportunity is growing. The ecosystem is expanding. ServiceNow is a growth company on every level. We see the growth across multiple buyer personas as customers consume more of our expanding solution portfolio. In Q3, both ITSM and ITOM were in 17 of our top 20 deals, with six deals each over $1 million. Security and risk were in 15 of the top 20 with five deals over $1 million. Customer and Employee Workflows were each in 12 of the top 20. Once again, we saw Creator Workflows in all the top 20 deals with nine deals over $1 million. Customers view ServiceNow as mission-critical. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow to support the global defense supply chain with automated workflows. Faced with the crisis of Hurricane Ian, State of Florida worked with ServiceNow to deploy a mission-critical application to manage requests from people searching for their loved ones. In crisis situations, weeks to deploy isn't an option, which is why the State did it on ServiceNow in a few hours. Deutsche Telekom provided KPN works with ServiceNow to reduce their order management process from three days to under a minute, saving millions. Thank you. These stories are everywhere. In fact, one CEO chose ServiceNow for the first time said it best to me personally, \"It's always easier to make a strategic partner decision when you trust the people on the other side of it.\" In late September, we announced the ServiceNow Tokyo release. We delivered AI-powered task intelligence, which is all about making the customer service agents like more productive, reducing manual effort, speeding time to resolution and improving the customer experience. On the revenue-facing side, we delivered enhancements to order management, including support for bundling, configurable products and pricing models. We delivered major advances in field service operations and dispatch with scheduled optimization and territory planning. These capabilities help our customers better manage their costs but also their ESG footprint. At a moment when customer service is at the very top of C-level agenda, ServiceNow's net new innovation is driving and transforming the front office. The technology leaders, we released a new service operations workspace which will deliver faster incident resolutions to keep people highly productive. And given the ongoing migration to the cloud, we released a new licensed cloud cost simulator so leaders can model the cost benefits by moving from on-premise to cloud deployments. The Tokyo release contains many more new features across each of our major workflow businesses, technology, customer, employee and creator. It is the latest demonstration that ServiceNow's products and engineering machine is the best in the world, the best in class, like no other. And speaking of best-in-class, I've been lucky enough to learn from one of the greatest innovators at the 21st century. Fred Luddy and I have been on a multiyear journey together, one built on love and mutual respect. At this week's Board meeting, I was honored to take on the role of Chairman, with Fred remaining an active member of our Board for the long term. Fred remains the soul and inspiration of ServiceNow, and I'm honored to call him our founder and my personal friend. In conclusion, we again delivered on our promise in Q3. We said the company would continue its SaaS growth in any operating environment. We did. We said that cRPO growth would accelerate during H2. As our Q4 guidance reflects, it is. We said that we preserved the benchmark near the Rule of 60 for the full year and constant currency. We are on track. ServiceNow has a revenue growth, predictability of growth and sustainable business model. While others are managing the past, our engineers are innovating for the future. The fundamental question facing enterprises today is this: can modernization wait? With the robust demand environment we see, the answer is a compelling no, it cannot. The stated ambition of ServiceNow remains. We will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are firmly committed to that journey. We are focused on value creation for our customers, our partners, our colleagues and our shareholders. Our confidence in Q4 extends to 2023 and beyond. Sales capacity and pipeline coverage are higher today than at any point this year. We have best-in-class sales and marketing efficiency. We have a highly differentiated platform. We have a business model that will be managed by design for net new innovation, growth and profitabilities you can count on. With this growth and margin profile, operating near the Rule of 60, ServiceNow is a unique asset and a premier company. We are hiring with an absolute focus on people who can innovate through code and who could sell solutions and who can help customers realize success. The bottom line is this. When our customers work, the world works better for everyone. That's why the world works with ServiceNow. If we didn't do what we do, it wouldn't get done. The hallmark for ServiceNow is net new innovation.  And with that in mind, I thank you so much, and I'll hand things over to Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a fantastic quarter of execution. The team delivered strong results, beating all of our constant currency growth and operating margin guidance metrics, an outstanding performance across the board. Investments in digital transformation are a necessity, and ServiceNow remains a strategic priority. CEOs recognize that the Now Platform can deliver the workflow needs for their digital-first initiative while driving quick time to value and hard dollar savings. These outcomes are imperative in the current macro environment and while we continue to see robust demand for our products. In Q3, subscription revenues were $1.742 billion, growing 28.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.4 billion, representing 24.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.87 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis points beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance. 50 basis points of the beat was driven by early renewals from Q4 as the team looks to get ahead of our large renewal cohort. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We finished the quarter with 1,530 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. The number of customers paying us over $10 million in ACV grew 60% year-over-year as our cohort expansion remained healthy. From an industry perspective, net new ACV growth was led by retail and hospitality, up nearly 50%, followed by strength in education. Manufacturing had a good quarter as well, led by a large 8-digit deal, and technology, media and telecom continue to show durability. Federal had its best quarter ever, including an over $20 million net new ACV win. We closed 69 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including five with new logos. What's more, each of those five deals were led by a different product. That diversification showcases the breadth of our product portfolio and increasing customer awareness of ServiceNow's capabilities as a platform, which includes 11 organic businesses with over $200 million in ACV. In fact, 18 of our top 20 deals contained five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 26%, 1 point above our guidance, driven by our top line beat and operating efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 6%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro. Our ability to outperform in Q3 is a testament to the strong execution of the ServiceNow teams. Account executives are staying close to the customer, constantly checking in and proactively assembling the necessary materials to get deals across the line. We will operate with the same rigor in Q4 and are confident that we're factoring in the macro trends into our guidance. Consistent with the market on a year-over-year basis, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar also resulted in incremental FX headwind. We now expect a $290 million headwind to 2022 subscription revenue, a $330 million headwind to Q4 cRPO, 100 basis points headwind to operating margin, an approximate $160 million or 100 basis point headwind to free cash flow margin for 2022. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We're revising our subscription revenues range to between $6.865 billion and $6.870 billion, representing a raise to our year-over-year constant currency growth outlook to 28.5% excluding a 550 basis point FX headwind. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25%, consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year as we are offsetting incremental FX headwinds with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We now expect free cash flow margin of 29%, reflecting the incremental FX headwinds I previously noted. Despite the $160 million impact of FX, we will generate over $2.1 billion of free cash flow, demonstrating the incredible resilience of our business model.  Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 203 million. For  Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.834 billion and $1.839 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 600 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 26% on a constant currency basis, excluding 600 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 26%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a fantastic Q3. I'm so proud of our people for being focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. Bill and I would like to thank all of our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. Our business is resilient, our teams are delivering, and we're as confident as ever about the future. We have the platform enterprises need to reinvent their business models and adapt to the new economy so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We continue to see a robust pipeline and are maintaining our investments in growth hires as the opportunity in front of us remains large. We're well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go first this afternoon to Samad Samana at Jefferies.\nSamad Samana : Great to see strong results. Bill, maybe I'll start with you. You've been telling us, as you noted on the call that ServiceNow is going to grow durably regardless of the environment. I'm just wondering if maybe either the shape or the nature of the conversation that you're having with executives has changed in this type of environment, and how that's ultimately still allowing you to close all of these large deals and making this momentum?\nBill McDermott : Yes. I think Gina said it very well, Samad, when she said we're mission-critical and the Now Platform has really become the standard for digital transformation in a modern enterprise today. And we're solving so many challenges. Our customers need to drive automation and productivity. As you know, they're either not hiring, they're laying people off and they have to do more with less. We're built for that. They need the computers and the platforms to do the work so that people have a more pleasant experience on the employee side, and they require an experience no matter where they're working from, that's world-class. We take care of that. The customer service management has evolved from just the engagement layer of how I market to you, sell you, cross-sell you. It's really moved into the mid-office and the back office and back into the supply chain on how I can streamline with great efficiency, giving you the right product and the right form factor and price on time just as you expected it. And that end-to-end is all about the ServiceNow platform. And finally, you're seeing a breakthrough here on building net new innovation. Customers are going to have to do that for themselves and with partners. And we are also going into a co-creation mode with our partners in every industry and geo around the world. That's pretty stunning, and there's lots of use cases and examples. The big thing, Samad, is that C-level executives are looking to ServiceNow. They are calling us. They want to work with us. They see that we're the defining one. And that took some time to build and I think we're there now.\nSamad Samana : Well, the growth is incredibly impressive. And Gina, maybe just a quick follow-up for you. On the comment around factoring macro, and can you maybe just help us understand, last quarter, you called out slightly longer deal cycles. Any change, can you just dimensionalize what you factored in from a macro perspective as it relates to maybe deal cycles or close rates?\nGina Mastantuono : Yes, it's a great question. And certainly, we are not immune to the macro environment, and we're certainly not blind to what's happening around us. Our ability to execute despite the macro is quite astounding. And I give amazing kudos to our incredible sales organization around the world. We are staying closer to our customers than ever before, checking in with them, making sure we understand the levels of approval that they need to go through, making sure that we understand what they need to get that deal across the line. We will maintain that level of rigor that you've seen us do in Q3. And so while certainly, there's more outlook on deals that are getting closed and there's more -- people are looking at deals closer, but we are closing them. Close rates are stronger and we feel really good about how we put that all into our guidance. And so macro is evolving but our sales force is staying so close to our customers and really driving superb execution.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go next now to Phil Winslow at Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow : Congrats on just an awesome quarter. Bill, one of the things that you mentioned during your comments was sales capacity has never been higher and never has, and the coverage ratio for the year has not been higher. This is even on the context of growing sales and marketing headcount 30%. My question to you is, this is one of the biggest net add quarters in terms of employees in sales and marketing this year and over the past couple of years. You usually don't see a lot of salespeople moving to a new company in Q3 but they're doing that to ServiceNow. When you talk to these new employees and your management team, what are they saying about why they're coming to ServiceNow? And then Gina, you talked about continuing to invest in go-to-market there. You obviously hit 30% growth in Q3. How should we think about the exit rate for this year?\nBill McDermott : Well, Phil, thank you very much for your kind remarks and also the question. If you think about the first quarter of the year, the economies of the world really weren't shaking. Everything was going very well. And especially a tech company like ServiceNow, people were very desirous of having our people, too. But we still weathered that and we continued to hire. And obviously, the people that you hired in the second and the third quarter, the beauty of that is they're now becoming truly productive and certified to execute at a level that we would consider statistically relevant for moving the needle. And that's where I come with my max capacity. It's not just based on the number of people, but it's based upon their readiness to enter into the customer relationship with a level of proficiency so they can execute at a high level. That's what I'm talking about. And we're there now. And we're there stronger than we were all year long, Phil. So it's in absolute numbers. But it's also on readiness and it's in the pipeline and the coverage in the pipeline is better. So all those dials look great. In terms of why people come here, they come here for the culture. They know that this is all about net new innovation. It's all about customer centricity and brilliant execution and it's a politically fat-free environment. We just want to win, and people want to be a part of a winning organization.\nGina Mastantuono : And then on your question on actual sales and marketing hire, Phil, yes. ServiceNow is hiring and will continue to hire and are investing for growth. So we are absolutely committed to continuing to build up our world-class go-to-market organization and it's all about driving long-term growth and ensuring that we also are continuing to drive ramp rep productivity. It's really about ensuring that the opportunity that we see in front of us, that our sales and go-to-market teams are ready to drive that growth that we continue to see. So you'll see us continue to grow our sales, quota-bearing especially. We'll also be hiring our critical engineering heads. We're very much open for hiring these critical growth hires.\nBill McDermott : And one thing, Phil, I just don't want to fall between the cracks, is the 1 million in the RiseUp with ServiceNow campaign, where we're going to hire them. Some of them will end up getting hired here, of course, but we're going to train them for our customers, for our partners and to ServiceNow. So there's a bold move for 1 million ServiceNow-trained professionals to put them into the growth engine of ServiceNow. And that will be done on a global basis. We see bold moves that need to be taken in India, Japan, Korea and continued expansion in Europe. We just have a tireless appetite for growth.\nOperator: We go next now to Sterling Auty at MoffettNathanson.\nSterling Auty: My question is, when you look at the large deal activity in the quarter and the pipeline, how much of that is actually replacing legacy architectures to save money in this tough budget environment we're heading into? And how much of it is about that automation to drive increased productivity?\nBill McDermott : Thank you, Sterling. It's an interesting question. It's always important to reinforce that the 20th century architectures were heavily invested in by our customers. And our desire is not to replace them. Our desire is to make them more relevant so they deliver modern value and a highly agile and experience-oriented way for employees, customers and partners. So those underlying systems, some of them that are point solutions, and they never should have been there in the first place, they do disappear. The core large, well-known brand systems, they remain, but with the agility of the ServiceNow Platform above them and our ability to automate the workflows and completely change the experience set, we're now reinventing the way supply chains run for the biggest auto manufacturers in the world. We're now taking procurement management to an entirely new level of procurement and finance organizations for the biggest retailers, manufacturers, freight companies around the world. They were double-digit wins, doing this for some of the largest companies in the world. So they're taking out huge costs. They are getting rid of point solutions. They're keeping the main ones and then they're automating for speed and agility and value on the ServiceNow Platform. The business cases are unbelievable. It makes one ask, why are we so generous with our pricing? If they can get $1 billion, can't we get a little more? That's the situation we're in here.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss : Bill, congratulations on the new Chairman position, and congratulations on a great quarter in a difficult environment. My question is actually for Gina. You guys did a tremendous job in driving operating margins. At the same time, you're hiring to plan, right? And you're still aggressively hiring. Can you, one, talk to us a little bit about where you're seeing the efficiencies and sort of where you're able to kind of drive that incremental productivity out of the entire ServiceNow? And two, I was wondering if you could touch on free cash flow a little bit. It has been getting more seasonal over the years. This is the lowest free cash flow margin we've seen in quite some time. Were there FX impacts? Was there increased seasonality? If you could just give us any kind of visibility in terms of what happened on that side of the equation.\nGina Mastantuono : Yes, absolutely. Great question. So really proud of the fact that despite about 100 basis points of FX impact on our operating margins, we're able to hold them flat with our original guidance at the beginning of the year, while at the same time, still hiring for quota-bearing go-to-market fingers-on-keyboard engineers, right? And the efficiencies that we're seeing are across the board. So if you think about leverage in mid and back office G&A, leverage on the marketing side of things, if you think about really what our incredible cloud infrastructure team is able to drive with respect to efficiencies even in this macro environment, it's pretty remarkable. And so the other thing is that our platform drives efficiency for ourselves. We are the customer-zero for all of our new product innovation, so our platform enables those efficiencies across the board. So that's the other big lever that we always have to play here. So feel really great about the fact that we've been able to drive those efficiencies even through this current macro environment. With respect to free cash flow, absolutely. So Q3, in general, is a lower free cash flow period. We have our midyear bonus payout. We have bond interest payout. But we also have seen a pretty big FX impact in the quarter and for the remainder of the year. So we talked about 100 basis points impact on free cash flow margin that we're not able to absorb this year because truly the impact on collection happens all at once, whether the FX impact on your P&L because of the ratable way that we recognize revenue happens over a period of time. And so underlying health of free cash flow remains great. We're obviously, as we talked about, staying close to our customers and giving them some leeway on payment terms if they need it. But what I can tell you is that it's days as opposed to weeks. And so we are really staying close to the customers. The trajectory of free cash flow accretion over time remains the same.\nKeith Weiss : Got it. So it sounds like much more linearity and FX headwinds than any significant change in invoicing terms or payment terms?\nGina Mastantuono : Exactly, exactly.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg : Great quarter. Bill, I had a question for you. You've made some previous advances in observability of Lightstep. In this quarter, you acquired Era Software, which looks like a great addition to the platform. Can you talk about sort of what the integration plans are there and sort of maybe refresh what this means for your broader observability efforts?\nBill McDermott : Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much for the question, Matt. Basically, if you look at what we're trying to do here, we are bringing a scalable, cloud-native log management solution and database that complements Lightstep's existing solutions to the world. And this is really exemplifying and accelerating our vision, which is essentially to unify telemetry, logs, metrics and traces and now deliver that truly unified observability workflow on one platform. And this is going to take huge costs out of the equation, and it's going to bring a much greater experience to all users involved because they'll avoid the confusing context switches they have to do now. So all the integration work that is necessary is being done. It is all integrated back onto the Now Platform and there's a road map to do that. But right now, we're extremely happy with the way Ben is leading. Era Software just makes us stronger, and we're super excited about the future of this business and what it can be. It's going to be interesting to watch this thing play out.\nOperator: We go next now to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Bill, I don't think we've heard you say the words procurement and supply chain more often than you have on this earnings call. And I guess I want to dive into that because after seeing SAP's results, after what Oracle was talking about, it does feel like there's a -- there's like a deferred amount of activity that's getting done in the back office. And I just want to see your take on kind of participating in that activity as you're talking about that driving, it seems like, some pretty material wins in the quarter. And then I guess maybe a follow-up for Gina is around linearity in the quarter. And also if there's a way to quantify the federal business seems like it, again, had the best quarter ever. Just how much of that was upfront or kind of self-hosted revenue recognition?\nBill McDermott : Alex, first of all, let me thank you for your question. You're right. There's quite a bit that has to be done in the back office to automate business processes for a new world order of things in the macro. So you're 100% right. It's still early days, but I see a massive opportunity, given how much enterprises spend on ERP today. And if you look at procurement and supplier life cycle management solutions that make it possible for customers to unify these transactional systems and enable them, through workflow capabilities, that truly drive efficiency. And the user experience and the consumer grade aspect of ServiceNow is really coming front and center because these transactional systems, they all work fine if you're a power user or a super user. But when you start to get more people collaboratively involved in a process, there's a demand now for consumer-grade UX. And there's nothing that works better than workflow automation to solve some of these problems. So we are providing a collaborative platform for all the stakeholders in an enterprise, and that consistent user experience is our superpower. And I do want to underscore, we are not interested or trying to replace the transactional systems of the brands that you mentioned. Those are wonderful companies and they do something that's very important. What we're responding to is the agility of the supply chain and how you can reorient it in record speed because that's what this world order is asking for, how you can rethink suppliers to manage different labor issues, whether it's in arbitrage or just buying from the people you should be based on your ESG efforts, or your MWBE spend and many other things that many customers care a lot about. ESG is a big thing. They're doing that all on the workflow automation context of ServiceNow. And they love the fact that we integrate with everybody, and we're not at war with anybody because we're on the side of the customer and that's what we should all be doing.\nGina Mastantuono : And on your question, Alex, on linearity in the quarter, we actually had great linearity in Q3, our best ever. Really, really pleased with how the sales organization is, again, staying really close to the customers. Federal business had its best quarter ever this year in Q3 and outperformed. We had 16 deals over $1 million, one of which closed with over $20 million of net new ACV. Federal also saw great linearity in the quarter really because the platform is demonstrating such strong ROI that is really enabling them to get through the approval process faster. We're really seeing an increase in the volume of federal agencies that are really looking at their partnership with ServiceNow through an enterprise lens, right? So those deals are getting bigger, more strategic, more multiyear. And we're seeing cabinet-level agencies really trying to consolidate contracts at an enterprise level with us and standardize their spend on the Now Platform. So federal team just doing incredible work with their customers. With respect to hosted, we had about 3% this year -- sorry, this quarter, which is flat quarter-on-quarter but down 1% from last year Q3. And so really great linearity across the board. Hosted, flat quarter-over-quarter but down 1 point year-over-year, which is actually a headwind to that revenue growth, which means our revenue growth is even stronger. So really, really great results across the board.\nOperator: We take our next question now from Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan : Congratulations, and what a change from the Microsoft earnings conference call yesterday. Bill, I wanted to get your perspective. You talked about the great reprioritization. Microsoft talked about how some new cloud workloads are being paused by the customers and they're optimizing existing workloads. So I just wanted to see, what is it that is different about the prioritization of ServiceNow in the face of other headwinds that we're starting to hear about in the public cloud? And how does this position the company for '23 looking into a more uncertain time? We all thought we're going to have a recession in '22. We sort of escaped it. Maybe it happens in '23 or maybe it doesn't. The great reprioritization that you talked about, Bill, how are customers viewing the value proposition, return on investment on ServiceNow relative to the cost of capital? And Gina, if you could care, how would you be approaching calendar '23 guidance? Are you going to be more conservative than usual, given the rising environment that we all appreciate?\nBill McDermott : Yes, Kash. Markets are very rational. Customers are extremely focused right now on productivity. They care a lot about their customers and their employees and obviously, their bottom lines. And no platform in the enterprise software industry gets them what they want faster, from creating great experiences for their employees. You can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience until you first energize your employees. So that's 1 aspect of it. They know they have to have more productive, happy people. The cost of turnover and problems in the workforce, it's a huge, huge bottom line hit that a lot of people don't factor into the equation. And a lot of it is caused by bad onboarding, bad systems and not really a great user experience for the people who work for their company from anywhere they want to be. And as it relates to the customer, I touched on that. I think what we're adding on customer service management right now with the completeness of our vision is stunning in terms of value creation and a big surprise to customers who didn't use to think of ServiceNow in that space and now they do. And as it relates to our core IT, I mean, we obviously believe -- not to go into great details on that, but they're blown away by the San Diego release in March and the Tokyo release in October. They know there's an immediate cycle from what they need and how quickly we can engineer it and get it into the release level. So the existing customers love that, that they have this incredible seamless experience with ServiceNow. They know the innovation is coming on time and at the highest level of quality. And finally, I think, and at a platform level, the need to speed, Kash, is everything. Getting these business cases rational, getting these customers up and running swiftly and demonstrating immediate business value is the essential ingredient. I didn't give you one example in the ERP world where we did not get these customers live in more than 100 days. So we're talking need for speed and we're talking ability to deliver and the customers are having great experiences. You can't find a customer in the global economy that doesn't love the platform. I keep trying, I still can't find them.\nGina Mastantuono : And Kash, on your question with respect to 2023, obviously, we'll provide more details on 2023 in January. Overall, as you're hearing from our tone, the demand that we're seeing for the Now Platform has remained resilient and strong. FX, as you know, has become a significant headwind, particularly over the last three months. Since the beginning of this year, we now see about a $400 million headwind related to FX in 2023. And we certainly don't think the macro environment is, all of a sudden, going to change as we enter into 2023. So when we think about guidance, we'll be taking all of these factors into account, as you would expect us to.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Brad Sills of Bank of America.\nBrad Sills : I wanted to ask about an update quickly on the SI channel. I think, Bill, in the past, you've said seven or eight of the top 10 global SIs with $1 billion-plus pipeline. That's just an astounding number when you think just a few years ago, that channel was almost non-existent. So just curious, how much of their productivity is contributing to your results here today? How do they give you that reach into these other departments that historically ServiceNow hasn't been and obviously, you're talking about ERP and back office, creator employee customer. You're seeing a ton of momentum there. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how important that channel is in bringing you into those types of opportunities and the traction you're seeing there.\nBill McDermott : Brad, it's a great question. And look, it was very interesting in the early days just opening people's minds to the power of the Now Platform. And our global partner ecosystem is obviously a meaningful enabler. And they're critical for us to drive successful implementations for our customers and also to tailor our products to different industries. So this idea of co-creation, whether it's for an industry, it's for a sub-industry vertical and even at a micro-vertical level, we've only scratched the surface of what's possible with the ecosystem. We're young in terms of the runway for growth. As it relates to the top ones, we now have eight of the top 10 global advisory and systems integrators that have committed to a plan greater than $1 billion with ServiceNow. And again, I'm very open to the ecosystem. And that's why you see us making a bold move today on RiseUp with ServiceNow to scale 1 million. I know I undercalled it but it is what it is. I'm sure it will be 2 million because there's such demand for the platform. And I really want our partners to love and trust ServiceNow as we love and trust them because it really is about mutual goal setting. It's about making sure we're very clear about who's doing what, and we don't duplicate efforts and we never disappoint our partners. It's all about trust. And they like us because we're straight shooters here and we want to win and they want to win. And the other thing that's happening is they have -- like to Kash's point on the great reprioritization, there's going to be so much spend that will go around. But what they all realize now is business impact is what it's all about, especially in this macro. And then more and more reaching deep into the ServiceNow relationship because the customers won't listen to long, drawn-out expensive time-consuming multiyear projects. If that project isn't in the same calendar year, the likelihood of getting approved is real low. And if you remember, in 2008, that was the era where everyone moved away from CapEx to OpEx, and that was where the cloud got the big tailwind. Well, now you got half of them in the cloud so they're looking at OpEx. And that OpEx question is which platform can get me to the winning equation the fastest? And which platform is going to be around 10 years from now to be a dominant force in my infrastructure? And that's where ServiceNow seems to be answering the bell.\nOperator: We go next now to Mark Murphy of JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: I'll add my congrats on a fantastic quarter. So Bill, how broad are your ambitions in the Employee Workflows market? I believe you had crossed $500 million there. Some of your partners seem to have 20% or 30% of their pipeline in HR. And now you have this Hitch Works asset for talent intelligence and skills. So just curious how broad is that multiyear road map at this point.\nBill McDermott : Yes, it's -- first of all, thank you for the question, Mark. It's really broad. If you look at Employee Workflows, they're 12 of our top 20 deals and we had seven deals greater than $1 million. And what we're helping customers do really is navigate this uncertainty that they're dealing with. And they've got to give these employees that they have, no matter where they work, a great experience. And it's not only limited to, I would say, recruiting, hiring, onboarding, training, certifying, providing all the services that the employee needs on one mobile app. And that includes off-boarding employees in a first-class way, which most companies forget to do, which really hurts their brand image. We care about all of that. But in addition to all of that, we're now in a world where customers are really pulling at us because they're like, \"Hey, I'm not going to have as many people. And I really got to think about reorienting my business processes or rethinking how I automate things that I just haven't gotten to yet but I need to do it quick.\" So our ambitions are always in the billions. And this is another business where we're in billions. And I think we're just getting started on the employee experience journey. And I'll tell you why. If you look at even ourselves, there isn't a single employee in this company that could tell you a single system of record that might be in the infrastructure somewhere in our cloud. They have no idea. But what they do know, like Gina said earlier, everything that they do is on a mobile application on their phone, and it says ServiceNow because we completely workflow automated the entire corporation. So they don't know anything else. And what we're constantly hearing is people want to join because their onboarding experience is so great. And we don't lose employees. We have gotten lots of employees joining here that literally bounced out of another company in a week because they couldn't stand the onboarding experience and said, \"This isn't for me.\" So everything having to do with the employee experience and the management experience. We launched in the Tokyo release a complete manager solution so we can manage their careers, their hierarchy of their training and development and they can also do that with their employees on the Now Platform. And all of this is happening in real time. So the system of record, again, we're not interested in being 1 of those, and we have no quarrel with any of them. We are interested in the experience and that's where the money is.\nOperator: We go next now to John DiFucci of Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci : Bill, we've done a lot of work on the U.S. government opportunity. And you and Gina both mentioned the record results there in this quarter. As you know, this is the fiscal fourth quarter for the government and likely the strongest spending quarter of the year for that customer or vertical, I guess, it's a vertical. But can you talk about the opportunity for any spillover into next quarter or even next year? Or is this really sort of a use or lose it mentality, something -- is that something you can avoid in this vertical so it's always going to be material just like a third quarter thing?\nBill McDermott : Yes, John, thank you for the question. We have always been really strong in Federal. And a lot of that is driven by productivity, efficiency and government organizations. And I think we can all agree that, that's a big opportunity. So that area of focus for us has always been a priority. The budget there is large and there's a lot of demand for updating the technology environment for governments. What they love about ServiceNow is we integrate the things that they've already done. And we're not in a debate about whether the task was done properly or not. The customer can decide how they retire point solutions by the bundles, but we don't insist upon that. We are driving the experience. And I can tell you with great confidence, John, we have a very strong pipeline going into the fourth quarter with more multimillion-dollar deals, and I couldn't be prouder or more confident in our team.\nOperator: We go next now to Karl Keirstead of UBS.\nKarl Keirstead : I'll ask a quick one for Gina. Gina, did that pull-forward phenomenon that you cited in 3Q continue into the fourth quarter, such that it's shaping up to perhaps be a little bit more front-end loaded in terms of renewal timing than you would have expected?\nGina Mastantuono : So I talked about the fact that one of the reasons why our cRPO beat in Q3 was related to 50 basis points of pull-forwards of Q4 renewals into Q3. And if you remember, on prior calls, I talked about the fact that this Q4 was a large renewal cohort because the fact that we were able to get some of them done early absolutely helped drive the RPO but also ramped our revenue beat as well. Expectation is that our Q4 renewal will be on par. We had 98% renewal rate in Q3. We expect similar levels in Q4, and so feel very good about the pace of renewals for the remainder of the year.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question this afternoon, and that will come from Michael Turits of KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits : Congrats on a good job. So maybe to continue on that vein. My understanding is the expectation for the cRPO increase was primarily predicated on renewals and at par as opposed to expansion. So maybe can you comment on how the expansions have been going both on the early renewals and the prospects for those that you expect to renew in 4Q?\nGina Mastantuono : Yes. Great question, Michael. Expansion rates, you know we don't give expansion rates anymore on a quarterly basis, but we reported last year expansion rates of 125%. And we've seen very strong similar expansion rates throughout 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the ServiceNow Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I'd like to thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Darren, and I'll add my welcome to everyone joining today's call. ServiceNow had an outstanding third quarter. Looking at the top line results in constant currency, subscription revenue was 28.5% growth. cRPO growth was 25%. On profitability, operating margin was 26%. All three metrics are above our guidance, beating expectations once again. ServiceNow had 69 Q3 deals greater than $1 million. Our U.S. federal business had its best quarter ever in Q3. We saw strength across industries and business segments. Our performance was consistent globally with Europe executing especially well this quarter. Our renewal rate remains best-in-class at 98%. We are the largest organically grown enterprise software company. We have an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale. As these Q3 results demonstrate, we fully intend to maintain this leadership position. Regarding the operating environment, in recent quarters, we said that secular tailwinds were stronger than macro crosswinds. They are. Nothing we saw in Q3 changes this core thesis. Digital technology is a deflationary force. The enterprise digital transformation market is validated. The investment thesis is stronger than ever. Hybrid multi-cloud deployments, adoption of a modern data infrastructure stack, cybersecurity and risk management, AI and data analytics, remote work and collaboration, these trends are not only durable, their relevance is expanding. There'll be 750 million new applications built by 2025. In the U.S. alone, nearly 100 million workers will remain in hybrid environments. 27 billion connected devices will drive more data in cloud over the next three years. And ServiceNow's platform directly addresses all these challenges, which translates to numerous growth vectors for our business. I hear one thing from CEOs consistently. Anything we prioritize must generate results in weeks or months. This is the essence of the great reprioritization. In past decades, waves of enterprise systems were introduced to meet market challenges of those times, operating systems, databases, applications. What we see now is a generational shift from architectures built in the last century to platforms engineered for this one. If you look at the ERP market, we see customers at various stages of their move to the cloud. Some of the world's largest manufacturers, for example, are consolidating hundreds of old procurement processes into a modern workflow experience. This declutters the legacy environment, driving more than $1 billion in cost efficiencies for just one of our many ERP wins this quarter. We could do it because ServiceNow was born in the cloud. We integrate with everyone. We meet our customers wherever they are, any environment, any organizational structure, any operating model. Where there is complexity, we simplify. We are fast to deploy, fast to generate ROI. In this need for speed environment, the ServiceNow Platform is becoming the strategic center of gravity for our customers. In light of this, today, we're announcing a new initiative: RiseUp with ServiceNow to skill 1 million ServiceNow certified professionals by 2024. Our customers, partners and ServiceNow itself are all growing as ServiceNow workforces. We see opportunity everywhere. With RiseUp with ServiceNow, we'll give people the knowledge to seize it. Overall, the demand environment is strong. The market opportunity is growing. The ecosystem is expanding. ServiceNow is a growth company on every level. We see the growth across multiple buyer personas as customers consume more of our expanding solution portfolio. In Q3, both ITSM and ITOM were in 17 of our top 20 deals, with six deals each over $1 million. Security and risk were in 15 of the top 20 with five deals over $1 million. Customer and Employee Workflows were each in 12 of the top 20. Once again, we saw Creator Workflows in all the top 20 deals with nine deals over $1 million. Customers view ServiceNow as mission-critical. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow to support the global defense supply chain with automated workflows. Faced with the crisis of Hurricane Ian, State of Florida worked with ServiceNow to deploy a mission-critical application to manage requests from people searching for their loved ones. In crisis situations, weeks to deploy isn't an option, which is why the State did it on ServiceNow in a few hours. Deutsche Telekom provided KPN works with ServiceNow to reduce their order management process from three days to under a minute, saving millions. Thank you. These stories are everywhere. In fact, one CEO chose ServiceNow for the first time said it best to me personally, \"It's always easier to make a strategic partner decision when you trust the people on the other side of it.\" In late September, we announced the ServiceNow Tokyo release. We delivered AI-powered task intelligence, which is all about making the customer service agents like more productive, reducing manual effort, speeding time to resolution and improving the customer experience. On the revenue-facing side, we delivered enhancements to order management, including support for bundling, configurable products and pricing models. We delivered major advances in field service operations and dispatch with scheduled optimization and territory planning. These capabilities help our customers better manage their costs but also their ESG footprint. At a moment when customer service is at the very top of C-level agenda, ServiceNow's net new innovation is driving and transforming the front office. The technology leaders, we released a new service operations workspace which will deliver faster incident resolutions to keep people highly productive. And given the ongoing migration to the cloud, we released a new licensed cloud cost simulator so leaders can model the cost benefits by moving from on-premise to cloud deployments. The Tokyo release contains many more new features across each of our major workflow businesses, technology, customer, employee and creator. It is the latest demonstration that ServiceNow's products and engineering machine is the best in the world, the best in class, like no other. And speaking of best-in-class, I've been lucky enough to learn from one of the greatest innovators at the 21st century. Fred Luddy and I have been on a multiyear journey together, one built on love and mutual respect. At this week's Board meeting, I was honored to take on the role of Chairman, with Fred remaining an active member of our Board for the long term. Fred remains the soul and inspiration of ServiceNow, and I'm honored to call him our founder and my personal friend. In conclusion, we again delivered on our promise in Q3. We said the company would continue its SaaS growth in any operating environment. We did. We said that cRPO growth would accelerate during H2. As our Q4 guidance reflects, it is. We said that we preserved the benchmark near the Rule of 60 for the full year and constant currency. We are on track. ServiceNow has a revenue growth, predictability of growth and sustainable business model. While others are managing the past, our engineers are innovating for the future. The fundamental question facing enterprises today is this: can modernization wait? With the robust demand environment we see, the answer is a compelling no, it cannot. The stated ambition of ServiceNow remains. We will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are firmly committed to that journey. We are focused on value creation for our customers, our partners, our colleagues and our shareholders. Our confidence in Q4 extends to 2023 and beyond. Sales capacity and pipeline coverage are higher today than at any point this year. We have best-in-class sales and marketing efficiency. We have a highly differentiated platform. We have a business model that will be managed by design for net new innovation, growth and profitabilities you can count on. With this growth and margin profile, operating near the Rule of 60, ServiceNow is a unique asset and a premier company. We are hiring with an absolute focus on people who can innovate through code and who could sell solutions and who can help customers realize success. The bottom line is this. When our customers work, the world works better for everyone. That's why the world works with ServiceNow. If we didn't do what we do, it wouldn't get done. The hallmark for ServiceNow is net new innovation.  And with that in mind, I thank you so much, and I'll hand things over to Gina. Yes. I think Gina said it very well, Samad, when she said we're mission-critical and the Now Platform has really become the standard for digital transformation in a modern enterprise today. And we're solving so many challenges. Our customers need to drive automation and productivity. As you know, they're either not hiring, they're laying people off and they have to do more with less. We're built for that. They need the computers and the platforms to do the work so that people have a more pleasant experience on the employee side, and they require an experience no matter where they're working from, that's world-class. We take care of that. The customer service management has evolved from just the engagement layer of how I market to you, sell you, cross-sell you. It's really moved into the mid-office and the back office and back into the supply chain on how I can streamline with great efficiency, giving you the right product and the right form factor and price on time just as you expected it. And that end-to-end is all about the ServiceNow platform. And finally, you're seeing a breakthrough here on building net new innovation. Customers are going to have to do that for themselves and with partners. And we are also going into a co-creation mode with our partners in every industry and geo around the world. That's pretty stunning, and there's lots of use cases and examples. The big thing, Samad, is that C-level executives are looking to ServiceNow. They are calling us. They want to work with us. They see that we're the defining one. And that took some time to build and I think we're there now. Well, Phil, thank you very much for your kind remarks and also the question. If you think about the first quarter of the year, the economies of the world really weren't shaking. Everything was going very well. And especially a tech company like ServiceNow, people were very desirous of having our people, too. But we still weathered that and we continued to hire. And obviously, the people that you hired in the second and the third quarter, the beauty of that is they're now becoming truly productive and certified to execute at a level that we would consider statistically relevant for moving the needle. And that's where I come with my max capacity. It's not just based on the number of people, but it's based upon their readiness to enter into the customer relationship with a level of proficiency so they can execute at a high level. That's what I'm talking about. And we're there now. And we're there stronger than we were all year long, Phil. So it's in absolute numbers. But it's also on readiness and it's in the pipeline and the coverage in the pipeline is better. So all those dials look great. In terms of why people come here, they come here for the culture. They know that this is all about net new innovation. It's all about customer centricity and brilliant execution and it's a politically fat-free environment. We just want to win, and people want to be a part of a winning organization. And one thing, Phil, I just don't want to fall between the cracks, is the 1 million in the RiseUp with ServiceNow campaign, where we're going to hire them. Some of them will end up getting hired here, of course, but we're going to train them for our customers, for our partners and to ServiceNow. So there's a bold move for 1 million ServiceNow-trained professionals to put them into the growth engine of ServiceNow. And that will be done on a global basis. We see bold moves that need to be taken in India, Japan, Korea and continued expansion in Europe. We just have a tireless appetite for growth. Thank you, Sterling. It's an interesting question. It's always important to reinforce that the 20th century architectures were heavily invested in by our customers. And our desire is not to replace them. Our desire is to make them more relevant so they deliver modern value and a highly agile and experience-oriented way for employees, customers and partners. So those underlying systems, some of them that are point solutions, and they never should have been there in the first place, they do disappear. The core large, well-known brand systems, they remain, but with the agility of the ServiceNow Platform above them and our ability to automate the workflows and completely change the experience set, we're now reinventing the way supply chains run for the biggest auto manufacturers in the world. We're now taking procurement management to an entirely new level of procurement and finance organizations for the biggest retailers, manufacturers, freight companies around the world. They were double-digit wins, doing this for some of the largest companies in the world. So they're taking out huge costs. They are getting rid of point solutions. They're keeping the main ones and then they're automating for speed and agility and value on the ServiceNow Platform. The business cases are unbelievable. It makes one ask, why are we so generous with our pricing? If they can get $1 billion, can't we get a little more? That's the situation we're in here. Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much for the question, Matt. Basically, if you look at what we're trying to do here, we are bringing a scalable, cloud-native log management solution and database that complements Lightstep's existing solutions to the world. And this is really exemplifying and accelerating our vision, which is essentially to unify telemetry, logs, metrics and traces and now deliver that truly unified observability workflow on one platform. And this is going to take huge costs out of the equation, and it's going to bring a much greater experience to all users involved because they'll avoid the confusing context switches they have to do now. So all the integration work that is necessary is being done. It is all integrated back onto the Now Platform and there's a road map to do that. But right now, we're extremely happy with the way Ben is leading. Era Software just makes us stronger, and we're super excited about the future of this business and what it can be. It's going to be interesting to watch this thing play out. Alex, first of all, let me thank you for your question. You're right. There's quite a bit that has to be done in the back office to automate business processes for a new world order of things in the macro. So you're 100% right. It's still early days, but I see a massive opportunity, given how much enterprises spend on ERP today. And if you look at procurement and supplier life cycle management solutions that make it possible for customers to unify these transactional systems and enable them, through workflow capabilities, that truly drive efficiency. And the user experience and the consumer grade aspect of ServiceNow is really coming front and center because these transactional systems, they all work fine if you're a power user or a super user. But when you start to get more people collaboratively involved in a process, there's a demand now for consumer-grade UX. And there's nothing that works better than workflow automation to solve some of these problems. So we are providing a collaborative platform for all the stakeholders in an enterprise, and that consistent user experience is our superpower. And I do want to underscore, we are not interested or trying to replace the transactional systems of the brands that you mentioned. Those are wonderful companies and they do something that's very important. What we're responding to is the agility of the supply chain and how you can reorient it in record speed because that's what this world order is asking for, how you can rethink suppliers to manage different labor issues, whether it's in arbitrage or just buying from the people you should be based on your ESG efforts, or your MWBE spend and many other things that many customers care a lot about. ESG is a big thing. They're doing that all on the workflow automation context of ServiceNow. And they love the fact that we integrate with everybody, and we're not at war with anybody because we're on the side of the customer and that's what we should all be doing. Yes, Kash. Markets are very rational. Customers are extremely focused right now on productivity. They care a lot about their customers and their employees and obviously, their bottom lines. And no platform in the enterprise software industry gets them what they want faster, from creating great experiences for their employees. You can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience until you first energize your employees. So that's 1 aspect of it. They know they have to have more productive, happy people. The cost of turnover and problems in the workforce, it's a huge, huge bottom line hit that a lot of people don't factor into the equation. And a lot of it is caused by bad onboarding, bad systems and not really a great user experience for the people who work for their company from anywhere they want to be. And as it relates to the customer, I touched on that. I think what we're adding on customer service management right now with the completeness of our vision is stunning in terms of value creation and a big surprise to customers who didn't use to think of ServiceNow in that space and now they do. And as it relates to our core IT, I mean, we obviously believe -- not to go into great details on that, but they're blown away by the San Diego release in March and the Tokyo release in October. They know there's an immediate cycle from what they need and how quickly we can engineer it and get it into the release level. So the existing customers love that, that they have this incredible seamless experience with ServiceNow. They know the innovation is coming on time and at the highest level of quality. And finally, I think, and at a platform level, the need to speed, Kash, is everything. Getting these business cases rational, getting these customers up and running swiftly and demonstrating immediate business value is the essential ingredient. I didn't give you one example in the ERP world where we did not get these customers live in more than 100 days. So we're talking need for speed and we're talking ability to deliver and the customers are having great experiences. You can't find a customer in the global economy that doesn't love the platform. I keep trying, I still can't find them. Brad, it's a great question. And look, it was very interesting in the early days just opening people's minds to the power of the Now Platform. And our global partner ecosystem is obviously a meaningful enabler. And they're critical for us to drive successful implementations for our customers and also to tailor our products to different industries. So this idea of co-creation, whether it's for an industry, it's for a sub-industry vertical and even at a micro-vertical level, we've only scratched the surface of what's possible with the ecosystem. We're young in terms of the runway for growth. As it relates to the top ones, we now have eight of the top 10 global advisory and systems integrators that have committed to a plan greater than $1 billion with ServiceNow. And again, I'm very open to the ecosystem. And that's why you see us making a bold move today on RiseUp with ServiceNow to scale 1 million. I know I undercalled it but it is what it is. I'm sure it will be 2 million because there's such demand for the platform. And I really want our partners to love and trust ServiceNow as we love and trust them because it really is about mutual goal setting. It's about making sure we're very clear about who's doing what, and we don't duplicate efforts and we never disappoint our partners. It's all about trust. And they like us because we're straight shooters here and we want to win and they want to win. And the other thing that's happening is they have -- like to Kash's point on the great reprioritization, there's going to be so much spend that will go around. But what they all realize now is business impact is what it's all about, especially in this macro. And then more and more reaching deep into the ServiceNow relationship because the customers won't listen to long, drawn-out expensive time-consuming multiyear projects. If that project isn't in the same calendar year, the likelihood of getting approved is real low. And if you remember, in 2008, that was the era where everyone moved away from CapEx to OpEx, and that was where the cloud got the big tailwind. Well, now you got half of them in the cloud so they're looking at OpEx. And that OpEx question is which platform can get me to the winning equation the fastest? And which platform is going to be around 10 years from now to be a dominant force in my infrastructure? And that's where ServiceNow seems to be answering the bell. Yes, it's -- first of all, thank you for the question, Mark. It's really broad. If you look at Employee Workflows, they're 12 of our top 20 deals and we had seven deals greater than $1 million. And what we're helping customers do really is navigate this uncertainty that they're dealing with. And they've got to give these employees that they have, no matter where they work, a great experience. And it's not only limited to, I would say, recruiting, hiring, onboarding, training, certifying, providing all the services that the employee needs on one mobile app. And that includes off-boarding employees in a first-class way, which most companies forget to do, which really hurts their brand image. We care about all of that. But in addition to all of that, we're now in a world where customers are really pulling at us because they're like, \"Hey, I'm not going to have as many people. And I really got to think about reorienting my business processes or rethinking how I automate things that I just haven't gotten to yet but I need to do it quick.\" So our ambitions are always in the billions. And this is another business where we're in billions. And I think we're just getting started on the employee experience journey. And I'll tell you why. If you look at even ourselves, there isn't a single employee in this company that could tell you a single system of record that might be in the infrastructure somewhere in our cloud. They have no idea. But what they do know, like Gina said earlier, everything that they do is on a mobile application on their phone, and it says ServiceNow because we completely workflow automated the entire corporation. So they don't know anything else. And what we're constantly hearing is people want to join because their onboarding experience is so great. And we don't lose employees. We have gotten lots of employees joining here that literally bounced out of another company in a week because they couldn't stand the onboarding experience and said, \"This isn't for me.\" So everything having to do with the employee experience and the management experience. We launched in the Tokyo release a complete manager solution so we can manage their careers, their hierarchy of their training and development and they can also do that with their employees on the Now Platform. And all of this is happening in real time. So the system of record, again, we're not interested in being 1 of those, and we have no quarrel with any of them. We are interested in the experience and that's where the money is. Yes, John, thank you for the question. We have always been really strong in Federal. And a lot of that is driven by productivity, efficiency and government organizations. And I think we can all agree that, that's a big opportunity. So that area of focus for us has always been a priority. The budget there is large and there's a lot of demand for updating the technology environment for governments. What they love about ServiceNow is we integrate the things that they've already done. And we're not in a debate about whether the task was done properly or not. The customer can decide how they retire point solutions by the bundles, but we don't insist upon that. We are driving the experience. And I can tell you with great confidence, John, we have a very strong pipeline going into the fourth quarter with more multimillion-dollar deals, and I couldn't be prouder or more confident in our team."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q3 was a fantastic quarter of execution. The team delivered strong results, beating all of our constant currency growth and operating margin guidance metrics, an outstanding performance across the board. Investments in digital transformation are a necessity, and ServiceNow remains a strategic priority. CEOs recognize that the Now Platform can deliver the workflow needs for their digital-first initiative while driving quick time to value and hard dollar savings. These outcomes are imperative in the current macro environment and while we continue to see robust demand for our products. In Q3, subscription revenues were $1.742 billion, growing 28.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.4 billion, representing 24.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.87 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis points beat versus our FX-adjusted guidance. 50 basis points of the beat was driven by early renewals from Q4 as the team looks to get ahead of our large renewal cohort. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98%, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We finished the quarter with 1,530 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. The number of customers paying us over $10 million in ACV grew 60% year-over-year as our cohort expansion remained healthy. From an industry perspective, net new ACV growth was led by retail and hospitality, up nearly 50%, followed by strength in education. Manufacturing had a good quarter as well, led by a large 8-digit deal, and technology, media and telecom continue to show durability. Federal had its best quarter ever, including an over $20 million net new ACV win. We closed 69 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including five with new logos. What's more, each of those five deals were led by a different product. That diversification showcases the breadth of our product portfolio and increasing customer awareness of ServiceNow's capabilities as a platform, which includes 11 organic businesses with over $200 million in ACV. In fact, 18 of our top 20 deals contained five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 26%, 1 point above our guidance, driven by our top line beat and operating efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 6%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the macro. Our ability to outperform in Q3 is a testament to the strong execution of the ServiceNow teams. Account executives are staying close to the customer, constantly checking in and proactively assembling the necessary materials to get deals across the line. We will operate with the same rigor in Q4 and are confident that we're factoring in the macro trends into our guidance. Consistent with the market on a year-over-year basis, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar also resulted in incremental FX headwind. We now expect a $290 million headwind to 2022 subscription revenue, a $330 million headwind to Q4 cRPO, 100 basis points headwind to operating margin, an approximate $160 million or 100 basis point headwind to free cash flow margin for 2022. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We're revising our subscription revenues range to between $6.865 billion and $6.870 billion, representing a raise to our year-over-year constant currency growth outlook to 28.5% excluding a 550 basis point FX headwind. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25%, consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year as we are offsetting incremental FX headwinds with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We now expect free cash flow margin of 29%, reflecting the incremental FX headwinds I previously noted. Despite the $160 million impact of FX, we will generate over $2.1 billion of free cash flow, demonstrating the incredible resilience of our business model.  Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 203 million. For  Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.834 billion and $1.839 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 600 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 26% on a constant currency basis, excluding 600 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 26%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, we had a fantastic Q3. I'm so proud of our people for being focused, disciplined and committed to helping our customers succeed. Bill and I would like to thank all of our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. Our business is resilient, our teams are delivering, and we're as confident as ever about the future. We have the platform enterprises need to reinvent their business models and adapt to the new economy so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We continue to see a robust pipeline and are maintaining our investments in growth hires as the opportunity in front of us remains large. We're well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Yes, it's a great question. And certainly, we are not immune to the macro environment, and we're certainly not blind to what's happening around us. Our ability to execute despite the macro is quite astounding. And I give amazing kudos to our incredible sales organization around the world. We are staying closer to our customers than ever before, checking in with them, making sure we understand the levels of approval that they need to go through, making sure that we understand what they need to get that deal across the line. We will maintain that level of rigor that you've seen us do in Q3. And so while certainly, there's more outlook on deals that are getting closed and there's more -- people are looking at deals closer, but we are closing them. Close rates are stronger and we feel really good about how we put that all into our guidance. And so macro is evolving but our sales force is staying so close to our customers and really driving superb execution. And then on your question on actual sales and marketing hire, Phil, yes. ServiceNow is hiring and will continue to hire and are investing for growth. So we are absolutely committed to continuing to build up our world-class go-to-market organization and it's all about driving long-term growth and ensuring that we also are continuing to drive ramp rep productivity. It's really about ensuring that the opportunity that we see in front of us, that our sales and go-to-market teams are ready to drive that growth that we continue to see. So you'll see us continue to grow our sales, quota-bearing especially. We'll also be hiring our critical engineering heads. We're very much open for hiring these critical growth hires. Yes, absolutely. Great question. So really proud of the fact that despite about 100 basis points of FX impact on our operating margins, we're able to hold them flat with our original guidance at the beginning of the year, while at the same time, still hiring for quota-bearing go-to-market fingers-on-keyboard engineers, right? And the efficiencies that we're seeing are across the board. So if you think about leverage in mid and back office G&A, leverage on the marketing side of things, if you think about really what our incredible cloud infrastructure team is able to drive with respect to efficiencies even in this macro environment, it's pretty remarkable. And so the other thing is that our platform drives efficiency for ourselves. We are the customer-zero for all of our new product innovation, so our platform enables those efficiencies across the board. So that's the other big lever that we always have to play here. So feel really great about the fact that we've been able to drive those efficiencies even through this current macro environment. With respect to free cash flow, absolutely. So Q3, in general, is a lower free cash flow period. We have our midyear bonus payout. We have bond interest payout. But we also have seen a pretty big FX impact in the quarter and for the remainder of the year. So we talked about 100 basis points impact on free cash flow margin that we're not able to absorb this year because truly the impact on collection happens all at once, whether the FX impact on your P&L because of the ratable way that we recognize revenue happens over a period of time. And so underlying health of free cash flow remains great. We're obviously, as we talked about, staying close to our customers and giving them some leeway on payment terms if they need it. But what I can tell you is that it's days as opposed to weeks. And so we are really staying close to the customers. The trajectory of free cash flow accretion over time remains the same. Exactly, exactly. And on your question, Alex, on linearity in the quarter, we actually had great linearity in Q3, our best ever. Really, really pleased with how the sales organization is, again, staying really close to the customers. Federal business had its best quarter ever this year in Q3 and outperformed. We had 16 deals over $1 million, one of which closed with over $20 million of net new ACV. Federal also saw great linearity in the quarter really because the platform is demonstrating such strong ROI that is really enabling them to get through the approval process faster. We're really seeing an increase in the volume of federal agencies that are really looking at their partnership with ServiceNow through an enterprise lens, right? So those deals are getting bigger, more strategic, more multiyear. And we're seeing cabinet-level agencies really trying to consolidate contracts at an enterprise level with us and standardize their spend on the Now Platform. So federal team just doing incredible work with their customers. With respect to hosted, we had about 3% this year -- sorry, this quarter, which is flat quarter-on-quarter but down 1% from last year Q3. And so really great linearity across the board. Hosted, flat quarter-over-quarter but down 1 point year-over-year, which is actually a headwind to that revenue growth, which means our revenue growth is even stronger. So really, really great results across the board. And Kash, on your question with respect to 2023, obviously, we'll provide more details on 2023 in January. Overall, as you're hearing from our tone, the demand that we're seeing for the Now Platform has remained resilient and strong. FX, as you know, has become a significant headwind, particularly over the last three months. Since the beginning of this year, we now see about a $400 million headwind related to FX in 2023. And we certainly don't think the macro environment is, all of a sudden, going to change as we enter into 2023. So when we think about guidance, we'll be taking all of these factors into account, as you would expect us to. So I talked about the fact that one of the reasons why our cRPO beat in Q3 was related to 50 basis points of pull-forwards of Q4 renewals into Q3. And if you remember, on prior calls, I talked about the fact that this Q4 was a large renewal cohort because the fact that we were able to get some of them done early absolutely helped drive the RPO but also ramped our revenue beat as well. Expectation is that our Q4 renewal will be on par. We had 98% renewal rate in Q3. We expect similar levels in Q4, and so feel very good about the pace of renewals for the remainder of the year. Yes. Great question, Michael. Expansion rates, you know we don't give expansion rates anymore on a quarterly basis, but we reported last year expansion rates of 125%. And we've seen very strong similar expansion rates throughout 2022."

I would now like to turn today's call over to Darren Yip, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.\nDarren Yip: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2022. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, such as our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures, in addition to and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. ServiceNow's Q2 results once again beat expectations on the top line and the bottom line. Revenue growth was 29.5% at constant currency. Operating margin was 23%. Both results were above our guidance for the quarter. Our 99% renewal rate remains the industry's benchmark. We had 54 deals over $1 million. Our 27% constant currency cRPO growth is also strong. And looking forward for a moment, once you factor the large renewal cohort effect in Q3, our full year cRPO outlook is also strong. Like other premier technology companies we are managing through the current macro. As you'll hear from Gina, we're simply returning to the outlook we originally set for you in January of this year on a constant currency basis. Unlike others, while the currency effect also applies pressure on our margin, ServiceNow will maintain our full year margin guidance of 25%. We will absorb the impact through disciplined cost management, as we run more efficiently on the ServiceNow platform. Looking beyond 2022, our confidence in our midterm aspirations, which we raised earlier this year to $11 billion plus by 2024 and $16 billion plus by 2026, is rock solid. In short, ServiceNow's iron-clad fundamentals will not waver. The secular digital transformation tailwinds are blowing stronger than the macro crosswinds. ServiceNow generates an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale. We believe there is a generational value creation opportunity here on every level of our company. Therefore, we are hiring, expanding and investing for the future. Growth companies don't get stronger than this one. Before I hand things over to Gina, let me offer some additional color to underscore the state of the business. Enterprise software is an all-weather industry. Some businesses out there are prioritizing enhanced productivity to lower costs. Others are evolving business models to stimulate growth. All of them know full well that digital technology is the only answer. That's why the demand environment to software is consistent and durable. Market research from IDC and several prestigious institutions on this call I might add have all affirmed the stability of technology budgets. We also see consolidation of enterprise software as buyers shift further away from experimentation with unsustainable solutions. So when you think about the technology sector they're on niche vendors, legacy leaders and platforms. ServiceNow is a platform company with strong demand in a fast-changing world. And this is consistent with what we see from our customers. It's all about reprioritization. Customers are making significant investments with fewer platforms to drive faster ROI. As this process unfolds, while sales cycles can deal sizes get bigger as more materials are negotiated into those agreements. And we at ServiceNow are on the right side of the great reprioritization. One customer sum things up well. She said, \u201cWe have a capacity challenge. Not the ServiceNow, but for all the others that want to be like ServiceNow. It's time to standardize on the platforms we trust for the long haul.\u201d The current macro environment likely will need overnight neither will the theme for automation as companies need to make money, save money and differentiate and they need to do all of that really fast. Time has become the greatest asset of business. When you look at our results and our opportunity, it's clear evidence that digital transformation is the only way forward. ServiceNow is helping our customers innovate to win. Our ability to execute is another key point of confidence. This is a proven team. And what's happening here is about more than great business results. It's about honoring Fred Luddy's founding vision to change the paradigm of enterprise software. That's why from a technology perspective, ServiceNow has maintained a fully integrated workflow automation platform that gives everyone the great experiences they deserve. With artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, process mining and low-code capabilities all embedded in our architecture, we make hyperautomation about people. With 750 million net new applications being built on the horizon, ServiceNow is leading the low-code revolution our Born in the Cloud suite of applications stretches across the enterprise end to end. And all of our businesses are performing extremely well. In Q2 ITSM was in 12 of the top 20 deals with seven deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 13 of the top 20 nine deals over $1 million. Customer Workflows was in 14 of the top 20. Employee Workflows 13 of the top 20. And Creator Workflows was in a remarkable 20 of the top 20. World-class brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Banco Bradesco, Virgin Media, Ireland and CDW are some of the many selecting or expanding on ServiceNow. Adobe Works with ServiceNow to transform the way it serves employees, driving 30% faster care resolutions for everyday requests. NTT Data works with ServiceNow to generate end-to-end visibility of their ESG performance and they also provide ServiceNow's ESG solution to their own customers. Same Hawaiian works with ServiceNow to streamline its end-to-end procurement operations. Frankly ServiceNow has become the platform for digital business. And looking at SaaS businesses across the industry that have built $200 million or greater in ACV businesses, it's important to call out that ServiceNow is actually accomplished that milestone with 11 businesses in our current portfolio. And several of these businesses achieved that $200 million-plus figure faster than many prominent publicly traded software companies. So we see countless opportunities to build on this with expansion into additional adjacencies. And most of these adjacencies will be built on our platform like you're seeing with ERP workflows. Others might operate as integrated portfolio businesses that benefit from our strong installed base across the Global 2000. And one example here is Lightstep, which is delivering observability and incident response to some of the world's most innovative companies. Overall ServiceNow is hitting its stride as a platform, as a business architecture and as a commercialization engine. And next up is our Tokyo platform release coming in September. I'm heading to Tokyo personally and this will be a major milestone in our growing commitment to the Japan market and our pursuit of our annual objectives. The final point I'd like to stretch -- stress is this fast-expanding ServiceNow ecosystem. This is happening with some of our most strategic partners. Through our partnership with Microsoft, our technology workflows to help customers streamline the migration of existing workloads to Azure. This is opening additional addressable market to ServiceNow by creating an expanded cost-on motion with Microsoft enterprise sales and public sector teams. This is about incremental net new revenue growth. We are not opportunity constrained. The need for digital transformation continues to grow and enterprise software remains a defining deflationary force in this marketplace. The ecosystem effect also applies to the talent marketplace. There's a massive opportunity to talented professionals who aspire to build their future on ServiceNow. And as an employer, while others in the tech industry are slowing or even stopping hiring ServiceNow is hiring. We are hiring. We are doubling down on our talent brand. And that's a reflection of our deep belief and the amazing potential of this company. Our customers and partners are also expanding their ServiceNow workforces at a record clip which is another indication of the expansive cross enterprise adoption we are seeing for the ServiceNow platform. Finally, ServiceNow's impact solution is a critical piece of our ecosystem strategy. We are setting a new standard with respect to fast deployment and value realization. The faster we implement, the more we expand the use of the platform. It all adds up to a virtual cycle for stakeholders and the ServiceNow. In closing, we are confronting reality, but not conforming to it. Our Q2 beat on the top line and the bottom line reinforces who we are. The digital transformation imperative will not shift to the sidelines. I would like to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for their continued trust and confidence in ServiceNow. We're proud to help you make the world work better for everyone. We will continue full speed on our growth journey to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are resolute because now as ever the world works with ServiceNow. With that I'll hand things over to Gina. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. In Q2, we beat the high-end of both our constant currency subscription revenue growth and operating margin guidance while maintaining our best-in-class renewal rate at 99%. Our business remains strong. Our opportunity is greater than ever. However, as Bill highlighted, our customers are feeling the effects of the macro environment. So what are we doing? What ServiceNow always does. We're putting our customers front and center to deliver a great experience so they can retain their customers, to drive productivity so they can bend the curve on the bottom line, to reinvent their business model, so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We're continuing to invest in our powerful go-to-market and incredible R&D organization to drive future growth while keeping both hands on the wheel and being disciplined with spend. We're leaning into our people path our commitment to our amazing employees so they can do their best work and we can fulfill our purpose together. This is what the ServiceNow culture is all about. Turning to our Q2 results. Subscription revenues were $1.658 billion growing 29.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an over 300 basis point acceleration in growth year-over-year. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO is approximately $5.75 billion representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. At the end of June, we started to see customers elevate larger spend decisions to the C-suite resulting in elongated deal cycle. We've already closed several of those deals in July. And as Bill noted, this access to the C-suite has resulted in even greater exposure to the capabilities of the Now Platform. Our renewal and net expansion rates remained very strong. Our renewal rate was 99% in Q2 for all regions demonstrating the resilience of our business. The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We finished the quarter with 1,463 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. And our largest customers continue to expand with us. We have now more than 100 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV, up more than 50% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom led all other verticals growing net new ACV 100% year-over-year and our Better Together go-to-market positioning continue to resonate as we closed 54 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV with 16 of our top 20 deals containing five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 23%, one point above our guidance driven by operating efficiencies partially offset by FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 16%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.4 billion in cash and investments. Together these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, let me give you some context as to how we're thinking about the months ahead. While our business remains resilient, we do expect the elongated deal cycles that we experienced in the last couple of weeks of June to persist for the remainder of the year. We have factored that into our updated guidance. Additionally, which I know is no surprise to any of you, we've continued to see an incremental strengthening of the US dollar resulting in further FX headwinds for the second half of the year. We expect the total FX impact to be a $220 million headwind for 2022 subscription revenues and a $180 million headwind for Q3 cRPO. We have a well-diversified customer base with over 80% of our business in large global enterprises. As a result, we expect to sustain our best-in-class renewal rates. Over 85% of our new business comes from existing customers, which drives our robust net expansion and predictable growth. We also continue to see a very strong pipeline at our recent Knowledge event, which some of you attended in Q2, we drove a 40% increase in pipeline year-over-year. We're confident that we're appropriately factoring in the macro trends as we see them today and will continue to be transparent as the remainder of the year unfolds. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. Primarily to reflect the incremental $87 million headwind we're seeing from FX since the end of March, we now expect subscription revenues between $6.915 billion and $6.925 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. That's 28% growth on a constant currency basis in line with the original outlook that we provided in January. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25%, as we currently plan to offset an approximate one point impact from FX with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We will continue to monitor FX rates over the next couple of quarters. We now expect free cash flow margin of 30%, reflecting slightly lower collection as we expect to provide greater payment flexibility to support our customers when they need us most in this current environment. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $203 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.755 billion representing 23% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 450 basis point FX headwind. On a constant currency basis, we expect subscription revenue growth to be approximately 27.5%. We expect cRPO growth of 20% year-over-year or 23.5% on a constant currency basis. As I've discussed in prior quarters, this reflects about two points of headwind and due to our larger than average customer cohort that renews in Q4. Excluding this headwind, our constant currency cRPO growth would be 25.5%. We expect an operating margin of 25%, and we expect $23 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. Finally, we remain very confident in achieving our 2024 and 2026 subscription revenue target of $11 billion plus and $16 billion plus that we provided at our Analyst Day in May. Our long-term trajectory has not changed. In conclusion, ServiceNow has established itself as an enduring platform. Our execution is proven and we continue to lean into our great opportunity with operational rigor. We're accelerating our development cycles with our September Tokyo release, to launch the powerful new products that our customers need now. We're doubling down and expanding our go-to-market programs for customers, including our top 250 key accounts to help them recognize value with greater business agility. We're being prudent with OpEx, but remain bullish on hiring go-to-market resources and the critical innovation roles necessary for future growth. And as always we will remain disciplined, as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. These actions will enable ServiceNow to continue delivering strong growth and profitability on our way towards our future targets. We remain ever confident in our journey towards becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world, for their incredible dedication and commitment. It's your relentless focus on our customers' needs that makes us ServiceNow strong. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. \nOperator: Thank you. Today\u2019s question-and-session will be conducted electronically [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. \nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I had a question for Bill. You talked about how deal sizes are becoming larger although, there are some delays in sales cycles in certain segments of the market. Can you talk about the flip side coming out of these elongated deal cycles, what are the positive consequences for ServiceNow, as these deals become potentially larger? And one for you Gina, you said that while the Q3 cRPO growth expectations have been reined in, it does look like the burden of cRPO performance shifts to Q4. Can you talk a little bit about how you sort of implied that you're keeping the year cRPO relatively unchanged, which means that Q4 is when we see the reacceleration? Can you talk about the dynamics there from the quarter-to-quarter perspective? Thank you so much.\nGina Mastantuono: Sure Kash. I'll take the cRPO question first. And if you remember, we've been talking about this for several quarters now that with the renewal cohort that Q3 was going to be the bottom, right? So if you think about a renewal of $1 million at the end of Q4. At the end of Q1, if it comes $750,000; end of Q2 $500,000; and of Q3 only $250,000 it will pop back up in Q4. And so Q3 is absolutely the bottom of that renewal cohort and we'll see that reacceleration as we move into Q4. \nBill McDermott: And Kash on the deal sizes, what you're seeing in certain cases is lengthening deal cycles because I call this the great reprioritization where C-level executives are now looking at their business and they're saying, what are the platforms that we will team up with for the next decade? And they are prioritizing that list along the lines of which platforms make me more productive or I can do a lot more with less because the work isn't going away even though you might have less people doing it. The second aspect is, how do I grow? And what channels will I need to innovate in to grow my business? And then finally, how do I differentiate against competition? Every industry has that marquee company that seems to be out front. And lots of times companies either playing catch up or they simply want to have a different level of secret sauce, so they can do something their competitor isn't doing. On all those dimensions, we're now seeing the ServiceNow platform chosen by especially the Global 2000 and that differentiation platform to really get business going either to save money or make money or compete better. And that is big because now we're not talking about a nice-to-have on the employee experience or better customer service management or even low code. We're talking about making that amazing platform the business platform for digital transformation for the world's largest companies. And I think Gina pointed out the $10 million and above growing at 50% year-over-year. So even as you might need to wait a little bit longer in certain cases, when you do it just gets bigger. And Kash, I think this is now the moment where ServiceNow really gets a big, big tailwind from a macro that forces customers to really think deeply about where they're spending their money. And they're not interested in long drawn out projects that might take multiyear to get there. They have to perform for the capital market now. So, we are bringing a calling card with the fastest ROI in the enterprise hard stock. \nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thanks so much Bill for the bold and confident message. Thanks so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much Kash.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Kash.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. \nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Gina with the large Q4 renewal cohort coming up. Is there any argument to try and get some of these deals done early perhaps before the backdrop deteriorates further? And I imagine where inflation stands right now, customers might be only too glad to lock in pricing. Is that part of the strategy? And just maybe a follow-up as well for Bill. Bill everyone knows the environment has changed and I think we appreciate why ServiceNow is only more important. But, how do you distinguish environment first execution at times like these? And how do you feel your field organization is performing during these uncertain times?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, Brad. I'll take that the renewal cohort. So, what I'll point to is our continued best-in-class renewal rates. Q3 at 99% across the board in every geography during this macro environment, gives me much confidence that the renewal cohort is solid, right? And so, sometimes we renew early, sometimes we don't. We are having conversations always with our customers to lean in to what they're trying to do and how we can help them back. I really tried to bring that together in the script by talking about how ServiceNow is focused always on the customer first, and we will absolutely continue to do that, and we'll meet our customers where they are always.\nBill McDermott: Brad, it's a great question, and I'll give you a little feel for how confident I am in the field organization. Now first of all, Kevin Haverty, who ran the field organization for over a decade as you know, is still on the executive management team and putting special focus on public sector. Paul Smith, who is an industry veterans running global sales, and he has a very experienced team and a tenured team in Europe, in Asia Pacific and Japan, and of course in the Americas, with our most tenured sales executive, who hits every quarter. So, we have a really, really excellent team on the field. We also have a very diligent attention to detail as we run the business on the ServiceNow platform. That's why we can run so efficiently. And I actually have something we call the CEO of digital dashboard and I have a complete purview on the pipelines across the world. And if you look at them year-over-year, our coverage is better now than it was last year geographically and by industry and by persona. I'm very comfortable with where we're at. And of course, I'm very comfortable with our ability to execute. Furthermore, I just want to give you some transparency on the coverage model. We're doubling down on tiring, as I mentioned. We will have a full capacity to achieve our 23 objectives at the Q4 mark. So, please know that we're covered and that actually intensifies along the lines of each month and this year to actually expand furthermore in our indirect or our digital sales effort. We're doing some very unique things there to not only cover existing, but also to get net new logos. And I did in the midst of the script did mention the Microsoft Azure arrangement where we can actually take advantage of customers that are moving to the cloud and taking advantage of a hyperscaler that's doing very well in the enterprise that's also teaming their sales force up with our sales force to cover net new revenue growth opportunity. This can happen at the IL-5 level. It could happen at the sovereign government level and it can also just happen in net new logos, where our strong market-leading ITSM solution can get many new customers to ServiceNow. It's good for Microsoft. It's good for ServiceNow. And I think it's also a tailwind that isn't really factored into our numbers.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, Can you Bill, I guess the platform message and that's what we hear in the market as well. Can you speak a little bit to the components? And I'm specifically wondering if I look at your slides the customer and employee workflow this quarter in terms of contribution was slightly lower than in other quarters. Is that a thing that is not quite as strategic or built out as the others and that's why there's something going on there, or maybe speak to that if something else what's happened there. \nBill McDermott: Yeah. Thank you very much Raimo I appreciate it. You don't read anything into the perhaps somewhat lumpy details on one workflow versus another in any given quarter. Employee experience is actually gaining momentum and we have a fantastic General Manager of that business who's been with us for many years along with our well-known great leader of engineering CJ it's Blake McConnell I'm talking about. And he's got a great team. We just leveled all of our product reviews about 10 days ago and the prospects in employee and customer is fantastic. We have John Ball, Jon Sigler two industry veterans at the platform and the customer service level, all those businesses are going to be absolutely fantastic. So don't look for one quarter or another to make any inferences. I think the employee experience in a world where headcount is going to be incredibly important as companies decide on their hiring case. They're going to need to create great experiences. They're going to need to aggregate all the services in one portal to give those employees the most productive, futuristic user experience possible to give them all their training and needs and make sure that they're serviced properly. On the customer service side, I just think what we're doing there on the mid and the back office to make the engagement layer come to life is extraordinary. So I really pumped up about us as a platform company. And I think the bigger thing you should read into it is companies now as they go through the great REIT prioritization on looking at things they used to do in the 20th century which is to double click and that's a lot. And how quickly do I realize the benefits from that? And is there a way using the ServiceNow enterprise workflow automation platform that, I can leverage my processes give people a great UI but also get business outcomes faster. And when I say faster, I mean, some of the conversations are in quarter or within half a year. And therefore, I think a lot of pressure would be on companies that tend to take a long time to get the value. The other thing which is new that came up very recently but it's happening. It is companies that are in point solution where the customer says, \"I like RPA or I might like process this or AI that.\" You're basically saying look, are they going to be on my team 10 years from now at the platform. And a lot of them are starting to consolidate those point solutions into the Now Platform and you guys got that covered. And they're getting good economies of scale from ServiceNow when they do that. So again, all of that is new developments where I actually think a macro could lead to a tailwind that's not in the numbers.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nBill McDermott: You\u2019re welcome. Raimo.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. \nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we just go back to the specifics in terms of the deal slippage in the quarter? Was it a handful of large customers? Are these deals just now taking place in Q4? And then Gina just help us understand your assumptions you've made around close rates in the overall environment. Are you assuming that kind of the operating environment in Q2 holds for Q3 and Q4? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Sure, great. Tyler sorry about that. So, yes, if you think about the elongated deal cycles, I want to be really clear and transparent as I always try to be with you on how we're thinking about the back half. And so we're assuming that we'll have similar trends through Q3 and Q4 on close rates and elongated deal cycles. What we also are trying to emphasize is that the deals aren't going away, right? They're elongated but many of the deals that were elongated in Q2 have already closed in July. And so those digital transformation tailwinds that we talked about the platform relevancy that we continue to talk about is very relevant and as relevant as ever which is why we felt very confident in reasserting our mid and long-term guide of $11 billion by 2024 and $16 billion by 2026. And so close rate we are taking into account the macro environment that we see in place today. Our customers were leaning in more than ever with our customers and we feel good about our revised guidance that we're taking into account everything that we're seeing in the marketplace today. \nBill McDermott: Yes. And I think if you really look at it Tyler I mean FX side, we always said no one is outrunning the strength of the dollar in this environment and that was pression of course because you've seen that play out in the market. And we also acknowledge that especially in theaters of operation that are more affected by the macro. You'll see a lengthening of the cycle because, especially in markets that have grown accustomed to doing things a certain way. Now, they're in the great reprioritization. There is a time equation there. But there's also an expansion of the power of our platform that's not factored into the numbers and we'll have to see how that plays out in the back half. But what I can tell you is we have a plan. We have a very carefully thought-through plan to actually not only get the deals that may not have come in at the time we wanted them but they come in. But we also have a plan to expedite the ROI conversation at the point of discussion versus the point of proposal to get to the close earlier so companies can factor a larger scale relationship with ServiceNow in. Many of them can't even believe how quickly we can get them to value because they may not be as aware for example of ServiceNow in Frankfurt as they might be in New York City. So, we're making sure that we're bringing all dimensions of fast ROI critical thinking and industry solution-based by persona and dynamite execution in each geo not only with ServiceNow, but also with our partners to deliver that business impact. And what's changed in the environment? You didn't have to have so much on business impact when digital transformation was all the rage you could land and just expand. Now, I think you have to have that conversation especially in the larger transaction and we're very, very well-equipped to do that.\nTyler Radke: All right. Sounds like you did -- on the road. Thanks a lot.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Tyler.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Tyler.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One for you Bill and one for Gina, Bill obviously you've operated in the software industry for multiple years and seen multiple difference through global crisis. I wonder if you could compare and contrast what you're hearing from the executives that you speak to year-to-date versus let's say the beginning of COVID European debt crisis global financial prices what are you going compare-contrast, what you heard from executives during those periods versus now maybe even sort of the KPIs that you're seeing in this business versus past businesses? And then, Gina just a follow-up on the sales productivity side, obviously sales productivity to your point remains high. You also grew sales and marketing headcount 26%. Last quarter you expected to grow headcount in the high-20s. Does that still hold? Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: So I'll take the second part first. And then, I'll pass it over to Bill. So sales productivity remains strong and is better this year than even last year. And so we expect that to hold, Phil and I feel really good about where we're leaning. We certainly have continued to hire feet-on-the-street go-to-market. We're continuing to invest. We are not pulling back at all, on feet-on-the-street hiring. And so we absolutely expect to continue to see similar pace in the back half as we continue to hire quota-bearing sales?\nBill McDermott: And Phil, just on the idea of the global financial crisis and COVID comparing that to this current environment they're all a little bit different, but the one thing that they all have in common is they were absolutely an Elixir for cloud computing. So if you think about the global financial crisis, Phil you remember, I was working with a different software company at that time. And I tell the story in that September quarter how I saw a \u20ac1 billion disappears in a day. So it was very sudden. This hasn't been a sudden. And actually COVID evolved a little less suddenly as well. But that was the moment where everything moved to the cloud. Remember, everything became OpEx. All budgets were controlled by the line of business executive. Well now, as you got through the global financial crisis and cloud computing, became the pervasive computing theme of the 21st century, cloud as would got you, through COVID because everybody had to work virtually and you had to enable productivity in a completely digital world because nobody was doing business in person. Again, cloud got you through it. And this one here what you're going to see is cloud just gets reinforced. And I've always said that the infrastructure moves to the cloud, the hyperscalers will all do great in this environment. And then there's only a couple of other SaaS platforms that matter. And while it may be a little bit lumpier in a macro that's reprioritizing things, those five platforms that have been defined by the marketplace will I believe do extremely well in this environment. And it will be yet another proof point that it's all about the cloud.\nPhil Winslow: Awesome. Thanks guys. Best of luck.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Phil.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate you take my question. Gina, on the free cash flow side clearly you have the luxury of leaning into margin if growth is seeing impacts. You did mention just a minor step down on the margin you're expecting there tactic collections. Somewhat of a similar question on getting on the other metrics, just wondering if there's anything you can add to put some context behind that, whether it's a certain industry or something you're seeing and then confidence you have the ability to use free cash flow to offset any moderation you're seeing for the rest of the year I think is very top of mind for investors. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, sure. So, listen, I think you're absolutely right and we have the flexibility and the ability, given our best-in-class margin structure to be able to lean in with our customers here, right? And so, I want to be clear, it's slightly lower collections, as we think about assisting our customers. And as you think about industries that probably have a little bit of cash flow or built up working capital, given the supply chain constraints, right? So those are the industries that you would expect to see us leaning in with here. But again it's a small impact to our free cash flow margin that, from our perspective, makes complete sense and it's really purely just timing. There's no concerns with respect to any bad debt assumptions or anything like that. It's just about allowing for and leading into a little bit longer payment terms, given the current macro environment. And so, real strength here. It's all about being proactive and working with our customers.\nMichael Turrin: It's helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Yes. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Gina, I think this one is for you and two for you. I think, Kash was trying to put some words in your mouth and talking about sort of no change in the CRP outlook for Q4. I wanted to ask you that question directly. Like are you guys adjusting your view on sort of the cRPO growth that you're exiting Q4 with? And any chance that you give us that number, so we have more of a sort of a perspective on sort of how we're entering calendar 2023?\nGina Mastantuono: So, I think, Keith, listen, I'm not guiding to Q4 now. But what I wanted to make the point and I think, what Kash was trying to allude to as well is, is Q3 the bottom when we think about that renewal cohort and how do we think about the back half, right? And so, you could imagine from our slight return to our January revenue guide that we are absolutely continuing. And I was very explicit in my script that we're factoring in throughout the back half of the year slightly longer deal cycles. And so, that will impact Q4 cRPO. But again just a timing perspective, right? Why we are also very confident in reiterating our mid and long-term goals of $11 billion by 2024 million and $16 billion by 2026. So I know you'd love to hear a Q4 guide. Give us a few more months and we'll give it to you then.\nKeith Weiss: I think all investors would love to hear Q4 guide, it\u2019s not just me. The other question I have for you Gina was on the operational. It sounds like it's not coming from headcount. It's not coming from slowing down hiring. Can you give us some visibility into where the additional operational efficiencies are going to come from in the back half?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So a couple of things. So we talked pretty explicitly about not slowing down hiring on feet-on-the-street go-to-market and on critical R&D resources, but we are being much more mindful and planful of other kind of support types of roles, as well as, if you think about T&E expense, event expense, marketing things, we're not cutting anything that's driving demand. Just being really smart and disciplined keeping the hands on the steering wheel making sure that we're being disciplined about cost, while really not touching our feet on the street or critical fingers on keyboards engineers. \nBill McDermott: And Keith\u2026\nKeith Weiss: Okay. Sorry, go ahead.\nBill McDermott: Go ahead with your last question. Go ahead. \nKeith Weiss: No. I was just apologizing for cutting you off before. \nBill McDermott: No, no Keith I don't want to miss your opportunity to get something. I just wanted to offer something to build on what Gina is saying like we never talk about this, but we've run the company on the ServiceNow platform. It's not an employee out of almost 20,000 people that know that we have anything, but to ServiceNow platform. So for example when you're hiring it's pretty nice to know in real time where the money is moving in terms of the market and what it takes to hire the best-in-class talent and how you can adjust the ratios of salary versus equity and these kinds of things. That for a large company can be millions and millions of dollars. It's pretty nice to run on a platform that's the leanest in terms of the G&A component of it in the industry. So there are many aspects of the ServiceNow platform that we're actually putting to work on the agility side for the savings that we're putting forward and managing operational excellence can hold our margin rate. And a lot of companies could never do that on the fly. So that's a very interesting observation. The second thing I just wanted to say like, just out of all respect for all shareholders like between love and respect our shareholders, you have no issues with this company on renewals and the cohort from Q3 to Q4. It follows the historical path. It's just that we never outlook that way. So why start now? But I think we should give you every confidence that the company is in great shape and you don't need to lose any sleep. \nKeith Weiss: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a clarification than a question. Gina the clarification is for you and I agree with the other Keith's comment that I think investors are candidly disappointed with the cRPO guide for September. And so when you say there'll be an increase for the December quarter do you mean from the from the 25.5 adjusted number or the 23.5 if you could just clarify what an increase the base level is. And then my question for Bill is something we talked about a few times over the last year. As sales cycles elongate the valuations of tech companies are declining continue to decline. And so how do you think about the ability to make M&A work on behalf of ServiceNow does increase your interest no change in strategy. If you could just update us on how you're thinking about the M&A opportunities as you look at the deal pipeline? Many thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Keith. On the clarification and I know everyone wanted to get a few for Board guide for me on cRPO. What I will say is that we expect it to reaccelerate from Q3 and we expect it to reaccelerate by at least two points because that's what the renewal cohort is impacting in Q3. \nKeith Bachman: Yes. Sorry, Gina just to push you but accelerate from what? What number are you referring to is what I'm trying to clarify? \nGina Mastantuono: The 23.5. The 23.5 that is the constant currency guide for Q2 -- sorry for Q3 we expect Q4 to increase by at least two points from there. \nKeith Bachman: Okay. Okay. Many thanks. And then Bill for you?\nBill McDermott: Yeah. So first of all on our capital allocation strategy, there is no change to the strategy at this time. The $11 billion plus and the $16 billion plus with regards to 2024 and 2026 respectively. As Gina said, we reinforced that that's based upon our current strategy and no change to it. I also would say that we have done tuck-ins and that's business as usual. One of them that is co-fired really is Hitchworks and we did that because the employee experience now matters more than ever. And managing employees and their capabilities to the productivity needs and the project needs that different companies are managing are really, really important priority now. So it's those kinds of things where it makes sense to one of our core platforms. It's what the customer wants. It's the tuck in. That's the kind of thing that we would look to do. I do acknowledge that you bring up a good point. We're in a very strong position when Gina gave you the cRPO with the RPO at $11.5 billion and the cash is $5.4 billion. We know that's only going to grow over time. So we're watching everything. But right now there's absolutely no change to the strategy.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nBill McDermott: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So kind of going on this path, I think one of the other things that candidly surprised people was just the rate of change and the pace of change in Q2. So maybe just help us understand when did these issues start showing up? I think you've alluded to certain verticals and certain geographies that may have been more impacted than others. And to the question, I guess, that was asked earlier Gina, if you think about the assumptions that you're making in terms of what you're seeing now in July for the rest of the year versus maybe what you saw in the quarter, are you assuming in some of the guide particularly for cRPO in the back half in worsening of trends as you start to see longer sales cycles on a larger cohort of bookings come to bear? And then just on the cash flow portion, I guess, is there an assumption in that 30% that there's a further deterioration or further I would say flexibility in terms of collections with certain clients, or are you already embedding some conservatism there?\nGina Mastantuono: So I'll start with the forecast, right? And so we're not assuming a worsening trend in our cRPO guide from what we saw in the last couple of weeks of June. And so the rate of change when the issues start showing up, it was very late in the quarter and we are assuming similar assumptions in Q3 and Q4, so no worsening trends. In fact July looks strong. A lot of those deals have closed. And as Bill articulated some actually closed at a higher bill of materials than initially assumed. And so similar assumptions for Q3 and Q4 and this is after, Alex rigorous analysis of pipeline trends, rigorous analysis by industry. Coverage rate ratios look strong. And so very similar to what we saw in the last couple of weeks of June is our assumption and what we're seeing through July. On the free cash flow, the 30% includes the flexibility that I'm talking about. I do not expect further deterioration from that point.\nBill McDermott: And Alex in our customer relationships, the relationship with the customers couldn't be better. If you live a customer set you look at Net Promoter Score, you look at the retention rate the Gina 99-plus. And it's absolutely the standard in the industry. And if you look at Q2 specifically and you say, where did you see what? As Gina has said, last couple of weeks of June, you saw some deals elongate their cycles based upon higher levels of authority having to approve them and you saw that more in Europe than you saw in other geographies. So that's it in a nutshell. And as it relates to the guide the guide like Gina has said assumes a continuation of that to ensure we had this level based on our customers dealing with their macro because that's what enterprise companies do. We serve them so they can serve their customers. And we factored that into the guide again, it's restoring the 2022 guide. We don't know FX is an issue across the industry. And we all know that we've heard our customers are dealing with a tougher macro that's in the numbers. I'm not worried at all about Gina's guide on the Q3 or the cohort conversation going into Q4. We're in great shape. We really are in great shape. So don't take waiting for it a little bit longer as any lack of strength. On the contrary, we're seeing signs that it's making us even stronger.\nAlex Zukin: Super clear. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Gina.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Alex.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Alex. Operator We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks for taking my question. ServiceNow has such a unique perspective across such a broad swath of different IT categories. I'm curious with the changing macro, if you're seeing any reprioritization within the categories whether it's IT or customer employee, custom apps anything you've noticed there?\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much Brad. There's no question that all of those dimensions are really super important. But this low-code revolution if you think about companies having to build 750 million net new applications in the next two years you have to say that that's one that we should do a call out on especially since we have the best low-code platform in the business. There's nobody that's going to back off on taking care of their customers and having a predictive way of managing their relationships with their customers and to make sure the promise that's made in the engagement layer can be kept in the full value chain of mid and back office operations. So, you deliver the right product at the right price point configurations in the right place at the right time. And then you service that customer and that account very carefully. Every company wants to do that. And I can tell you the employee experiences piece super, super important because you have to make every employee to have more productive. And then if you're not going to have the employee number that you expected because you have to deal with the macro you're going to have to apply automation. So I think this experience of the knowledge worker and how you enable them to work from any place and be extremely happy and productive, because you don't want them to turn over. And certainly you got to get it more out of each one, so you own automation. And I don't think any company will argue with that. And then on the IT side, I mean, it is the marquee jewel of our company and it just keeps chugging along and growing and growing and growing. And one of the areas that has really taken off is asset manager, because companies have to be very careful on how they manage their assets. They have to get all the value out of their assets. So they have to bring their assets in and they have to retire their assets, and they have to do that in a highly sustainable way, which is something that Gina have championed along with CJ for the company on ESG. And that's a really fast-growing business for us. And security operations, if you look at having all security operations on one pane of glass, because security is an issue at the C level in every company. And it's not because they haven't invested. They've invested so much in so many different things that they need one thing that can pull it all together, so they have visibility on an end-to-end basis to secure their operations and that's been just growing so, so fast for us. And I do want to give a shout out to Ben and Lightstep. I mean, the logos that they win is just on real. So when you think of observability and the areas that Lightstep and Ben are driving in the best brands in the world, the most innovative brands in the world is pretty compelling. And again, that's all part of our IT category. So they're all doing very, very well. \nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Brad.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen.\nDerrick Wood : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, there's clearly been a lot of questions on what's causing the sales cycle and kind of where it's coming from. Maybe I'd ask it in a different way. When you look at your three core cohorts the G2K, the government and the commercial, could you just kind of give us a little compare contrasting across those three areas? And then since we're heading into the big government flush quarter in Q3. How do you feel about pipeline and close rates and spending behavior out of the Fed looking into the upcoming quarter?\nBill McDermott: Yes. Thank you very much Derrick. As you know this is the time of the year for the government business couldn't be more confident. I could tell you couldn't possibly be more confident and what we're seeing in federal state and local. In terms of our commercial business, very, very good. And if you look at our industries, we're very bullish on all of them. And I'm also very -- I'm very happy that we put industries as a priority for CJ and the whole engineering team to link the industry domain expertise of great development in cloud services to the solution experts that actually interface with the account executive in comporting the best possible, road mapping and account plan for every customer we have including how our partners in ServiceNow deliver that impact of business value. That value chain has fully been realized in its structure and its execution and we actually expect now to start getting some real returns out of that in the back half and beyond. So, we're real strong on all the dimensions that you mentioned. And really, really can't be more confident. \nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add to that, the largest industries we play in if you think about financial services industry \u2013 energy, sorry, public sector federal telcom. These are all industries that holds up I know most resilient in these environments. And so, feel really good about the industry perspective. Said Q3 going into Q3 feel really strong. In particular, we had great results and impact even in Q2 in the Fed business. We saw really strong demand for that new solution. So as we're going into Q3, the federal team has ramped up and very excited. And so really across the board from an industry perspective federal, as well as the G2K very strong. \nQ \u2013 Derrick Wood: Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Derrick\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Derrick\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Reed [ph] with Bernstein. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking my call, One of the things that I think the business is been built on for so long has been a consistency and the ability to expand and you've talked about the elongating sales cycle, and you might be able to interpret that as putting a damper on expansion. But what I observe looking at your cohort chart is, that you've been able to attain right around 130% net expansion with some of your oldest cohorts actually growing quite strongly and well into the mid-120s. What are you seeing that is enabling even your cohorts that are a decade or longer old, to continue to have such consistency particularly in a situation like this, where they may be incredibly built out and it might be easier for them to push out or see less strategic benefit? What is enabling that consistency?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. A few things there. So first of all, you're absolutely correct, right? We talked about 99% renewal rates across the board in every geo in Q2. We're also seeing exactly, what you're seeing on expansion rates, remain extremely high even at our scale even with our customers who have been with us for so long. The reason for that Peter, is exactly what we're talking about. It's the breadth and scope of our incredible product portfolio, right? It's the expansion out of IT, into HR, into customer, into creator. It's about the platform evolution story. And that is more powerful today, than ever before. And so you'll continue to see similar levels of renewal, expansion rates as we continue to innovate, as we continue to make our platform stronger and better and more capable and as we continue to innovate where customers need us and want us to go. \nBill McDermott: And Peter, one stat that may be interesting to you. Even where we have, as Gina has said, a great customer relationship and we're expanding along the lines of that platform, we're only 15% penetrated. So if you look at the product portfolio and the innovation that's come out of our engineering team, we in every count have so far to go against our bill and material to that road map. And all of that is upside in the Global 2000. And it also gives us permission to take it way beyond the Global 2000 as well, in our commercial business and our kind of inside selling business and some of the partnerships that we've built taking advantage of co-selling, with some of the bigger companies in the world will also be an interesting thing to keep an eye on. :  Thank you.\nBill McDermott: You're welcome. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one last question. Our last question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. \nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. So Bill, maybe to sum it all up here. How are you going to allocate your time over the rest of this year? What are your top one or two priorities? \nBill McDermott: Yeah. Thank you very much, Pat. One of the things I said is I'll be in Japan as we do our Tokyo release. And I'm doing that because Japan is a major market and we intend to treat Japan as one of the most important regions in our company. And that's the world's third largest market as measured by GDP and we intend to do extremely well there. I'll also spend 2.5 weeks going across APJ. I'll be in Europe and obviously across the Americas. So I think the most important thing and I've made this very clear to our management team is to take it to The Street. So I will be taking it to The Street. After we're done with this we have an all hands meeting, where we'll talk to 19-plus thousand of our closest friends, around our great Board meeting and now our wonderful opportunity to talk to our investors and now it's all about the customers. So when we take this level of passion to The Street it's usually very good things happen. \nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you very much both of you.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Pat.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Pat.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. ServiceNow's Q2 results once again beat expectations on the top line and the bottom line. Revenue growth was 29.5% at constant currency. Operating margin was 23%. Both results were above our guidance for the quarter. Our 99% renewal rate remains the industry's benchmark. We had 54 deals over $1 million. Our 27% constant currency cRPO growth is also strong. And looking forward for a moment, once you factor the large renewal cohort effect in Q3, our full year cRPO outlook is also strong. Like other premier technology companies we are managing through the current macro. As you'll hear from Gina, we're simply returning to the outlook we originally set for you in January of this year on a constant currency basis. Unlike others, while the currency effect also applies pressure on our margin, ServiceNow will maintain our full year margin guidance of 25%. We will absorb the impact through disciplined cost management, as we run more efficiently on the ServiceNow platform. Looking beyond 2022, our confidence in our midterm aspirations, which we raised earlier this year to $11 billion plus by 2024 and $16 billion plus by 2026, is rock solid. In short, ServiceNow's iron-clad fundamentals will not waver. The secular digital transformation tailwinds are blowing stronger than the macro crosswinds. ServiceNow generates an unmatched combination of organic growth and profitability at scale. We believe there is a generational value creation opportunity here on every level of our company. Therefore, we are hiring, expanding and investing for the future. Growth companies don't get stronger than this one. Before I hand things over to Gina, let me offer some additional color to underscore the state of the business. Enterprise software is an all-weather industry. Some businesses out there are prioritizing enhanced productivity to lower costs. Others are evolving business models to stimulate growth. All of them know full well that digital technology is the only answer. That's why the demand environment to software is consistent and durable. Market research from IDC and several prestigious institutions on this call I might add have all affirmed the stability of technology budgets. We also see consolidation of enterprise software as buyers shift further away from experimentation with unsustainable solutions. So when you think about the technology sector they're on niche vendors, legacy leaders and platforms. ServiceNow is a platform company with strong demand in a fast-changing world. And this is consistent with what we see from our customers. It's all about reprioritization. Customers are making significant investments with fewer platforms to drive faster ROI. As this process unfolds, while sales cycles can deal sizes get bigger as more materials are negotiated into those agreements. And we at ServiceNow are on the right side of the great reprioritization. One customer sum things up well. She said, \u201cWe have a capacity challenge. Not the ServiceNow, but for all the others that want to be like ServiceNow. It's time to standardize on the platforms we trust for the long haul.\u201d The current macro environment likely will need overnight neither will the theme for automation as companies need to make money, save money and differentiate and they need to do all of that really fast. Time has become the greatest asset of business. When you look at our results and our opportunity, it's clear evidence that digital transformation is the only way forward. ServiceNow is helping our customers innovate to win. Our ability to execute is another key point of confidence. This is a proven team. And what's happening here is about more than great business results. It's about honoring Fred Luddy's founding vision to change the paradigm of enterprise software. That's why from a technology perspective, ServiceNow has maintained a fully integrated workflow automation platform that gives everyone the great experiences they deserve. With artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, process mining and low-code capabilities all embedded in our architecture, we make hyperautomation about people. With 750 million net new applications being built on the horizon, ServiceNow is leading the low-code revolution our Born in the Cloud suite of applications stretches across the enterprise end to end. And all of our businesses are performing extremely well. In Q2 ITSM was in 12 of the top 20 deals with seven deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 13 of the top 20 nine deals over $1 million. Customer Workflows was in 14 of the top 20. Employee Workflows 13 of the top 20. And Creator Workflows was in a remarkable 20 of the top 20. World-class brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Banco Bradesco, Virgin Media, Ireland and CDW are some of the many selecting or expanding on ServiceNow. Adobe Works with ServiceNow to transform the way it serves employees, driving 30% faster care resolutions for everyday requests. NTT Data works with ServiceNow to generate end-to-end visibility of their ESG performance and they also provide ServiceNow's ESG solution to their own customers. Same Hawaiian works with ServiceNow to streamline its end-to-end procurement operations. Frankly ServiceNow has become the platform for digital business. And looking at SaaS businesses across the industry that have built $200 million or greater in ACV businesses, it's important to call out that ServiceNow is actually accomplished that milestone with 11 businesses in our current portfolio. And several of these businesses achieved that $200 million-plus figure faster than many prominent publicly traded software companies. So we see countless opportunities to build on this with expansion into additional adjacencies. And most of these adjacencies will be built on our platform like you're seeing with ERP workflows. Others might operate as integrated portfolio businesses that benefit from our strong installed base across the Global 2000. And one example here is Lightstep, which is delivering observability and incident response to some of the world's most innovative companies. Overall ServiceNow is hitting its stride as a platform, as a business architecture and as a commercialization engine. And next up is our Tokyo platform release coming in September. I'm heading to Tokyo personally and this will be a major milestone in our growing commitment to the Japan market and our pursuit of our annual objectives. The final point I'd like to stretch -- stress is this fast-expanding ServiceNow ecosystem. This is happening with some of our most strategic partners. Through our partnership with Microsoft, our technology workflows to help customers streamline the migration of existing workloads to Azure. This is opening additional addressable market to ServiceNow by creating an expanded cost-on motion with Microsoft enterprise sales and public sector teams. This is about incremental net new revenue growth. We are not opportunity constrained. The need for digital transformation continues to grow and enterprise software remains a defining deflationary force in this marketplace. The ecosystem effect also applies to the talent marketplace. There's a massive opportunity to talented professionals who aspire to build their future on ServiceNow. And as an employer, while others in the tech industry are slowing or even stopping hiring ServiceNow is hiring. We are hiring. We are doubling down on our talent brand. And that's a reflection of our deep belief and the amazing potential of this company. Our customers and partners are also expanding their ServiceNow workforces at a record clip which is another indication of the expansive cross enterprise adoption we are seeing for the ServiceNow platform. Finally, ServiceNow's impact solution is a critical piece of our ecosystem strategy. We are setting a new standard with respect to fast deployment and value realization. The faster we implement, the more we expand the use of the platform. It all adds up to a virtual cycle for stakeholders and the ServiceNow. In closing, we are confronting reality, but not conforming to it. Our Q2 beat on the top line and the bottom line reinforces who we are. The digital transformation imperative will not shift to the sidelines. I would like to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for their continued trust and confidence in ServiceNow. We're proud to help you make the world work better for everyone. We will continue full speed on our growth journey to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. We are resolute because now as ever the world works with ServiceNow. With that I'll hand things over to Gina. Gina, over to you. And Kash on the deal sizes, what you're seeing in certain cases is lengthening deal cycles because I call this the great reprioritization where C-level executives are now looking at their business and they're saying, what are the platforms that we will team up with for the next decade? And they are prioritizing that list along the lines of which platforms make me more productive or I can do a lot more with less because the work isn't going away even though you might have less people doing it. The second aspect is, how do I grow? And what channels will I need to innovate in to grow my business? And then finally, how do I differentiate against competition? Every industry has that marquee company that seems to be out front. And lots of times companies either playing catch up or they simply want to have a different level of secret sauce, so they can do something their competitor isn't doing. On all those dimensions, we're now seeing the ServiceNow platform chosen by especially the Global 2000 and that differentiation platform to really get business going either to save money or make money or compete better. And that is big because now we're not talking about a nice-to-have on the employee experience or better customer service management or even low code. We're talking about making that amazing platform the business platform for digital transformation for the world's largest companies. And I think Gina pointed out the $10 million and above growing at 50% year-over-year. So even as you might need to wait a little bit longer in certain cases, when you do it just gets bigger. And Kash, I think this is now the moment where ServiceNow really gets a big, big tailwind from a macro that forces customers to really think deeply about where they're spending their money. And they're not interested in long drawn out projects that might take multiyear to get there. They have to perform for the capital market now. So, we are bringing a calling card with the fastest ROI in the enterprise hard stock. Thank you very much Kash. Brad, it's a great question, and I'll give you a little feel for how confident I am in the field organization. Now first of all, Kevin Haverty, who ran the field organization for over a decade as you know, is still on the executive management team and putting special focus on public sector. Paul Smith, who is an industry veterans running global sales, and he has a very experienced team and a tenured team in Europe, in Asia Pacific and Japan, and of course in the Americas, with our most tenured sales executive, who hits every quarter. So, we have a really, really excellent team on the field. We also have a very diligent attention to detail as we run the business on the ServiceNow platform. That's why we can run so efficiently. And I actually have something we call the CEO of digital dashboard and I have a complete purview on the pipelines across the world. And if you look at them year-over-year, our coverage is better now than it was last year geographically and by industry and by persona. I'm very comfortable with where we're at. And of course, I'm very comfortable with our ability to execute. Furthermore, I just want to give you some transparency on the coverage model. We're doubling down on tiring, as I mentioned. We will have a full capacity to achieve our 23 objectives at the Q4 mark. So, please know that we're covered and that actually intensifies along the lines of each month and this year to actually expand furthermore in our indirect or our digital sales effort. We're doing some very unique things there to not only cover existing, but also to get net new logos. And I did in the midst of the script did mention the Microsoft Azure arrangement where we can actually take advantage of customers that are moving to the cloud and taking advantage of a hyperscaler that's doing very well in the enterprise that's also teaming their sales force up with our sales force to cover net new revenue growth opportunity. This can happen at the IL-5 level. It could happen at the sovereign government level and it can also just happen in net new logos, where our strong market-leading ITSM solution can get many new customers to ServiceNow. It's good for Microsoft. It's good for ServiceNow. And I think it's also a tailwind that isn't really factored into our numbers. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much Raimo I appreciate it. You don't read anything into the perhaps somewhat lumpy details on one workflow versus another in any given quarter. Employee experience is actually gaining momentum and we have a fantastic General Manager of that business who's been with us for many years along with our well-known great leader of engineering CJ it's Blake McConnell I'm talking about. And he's got a great team. We just leveled all of our product reviews about 10 days ago and the prospects in employee and customer is fantastic. We have John Ball, Jon Sigler two industry veterans at the platform and the customer service level, all those businesses are going to be absolutely fantastic. So don't look for one quarter or another to make any inferences. I think the employee experience in a world where headcount is going to be incredibly important as companies decide on their hiring case. They're going to need to create great experiences. They're going to need to aggregate all the services in one portal to give those employees the most productive, futuristic user experience possible to give them all their training and needs and make sure that they're serviced properly. On the customer service side, I just think what we're doing there on the mid and the back office to make the engagement layer come to life is extraordinary. So I really pumped up about us as a platform company. And I think the bigger thing you should read into it is companies now as they go through the great REIT prioritization on looking at things they used to do in the 20th century which is to double click and that's a lot. And how quickly do I realize the benefits from that? And is there a way using the ServiceNow enterprise workflow automation platform that, I can leverage my processes give people a great UI but also get business outcomes faster. And when I say faster, I mean, some of the conversations are in quarter or within half a year. And therefore, I think a lot of pressure would be on companies that tend to take a long time to get the value. The other thing which is new that came up very recently but it's happening. It is companies that are in point solution where the customer says, \"I like RPA or I might like process this or AI that.\" You're basically saying look, are they going to be on my team 10 years from now at the platform. And a lot of them are starting to consolidate those point solutions into the Now Platform and you guys got that covered. And they're getting good economies of scale from ServiceNow when they do that. So again, all of that is new developments where I actually think a macro could lead to a tailwind that's not in the numbers. You're welcome. Raimo. Yes. And I think if you really look at it Tyler I mean FX side, we always said no one is outrunning the strength of the dollar in this environment and that was pression of course because you've seen that play out in the market. And we also acknowledge that especially in theaters of operation that are more affected by the macro. You'll see a lengthening of the cycle because, especially in markets that have grown accustomed to doing things a certain way. Now, they're in the great reprioritization. There is a time equation there. But there's also an expansion of the power of our platform that's not factored into the numbers and we'll have to see how that plays out in the back half. But what I can tell you is we have a plan. We have a very carefully thought-through plan to actually not only get the deals that may not have come in at the time we wanted them but they come in. But we also have a plan to expedite the ROI conversation at the point of discussion versus the point of proposal to get to the close earlier so companies can factor a larger scale relationship with ServiceNow in. Many of them can't even believe how quickly we can get them to value because they may not be as aware for example of ServiceNow in Frankfurt as they might be in New York City. So, we're making sure that we're bringing all dimensions of fast ROI critical thinking and industry solution-based by persona and dynamite execution in each geo not only with ServiceNow, but also with our partners to deliver that business impact. And what's changed in the environment? You didn't have to have so much on business impact when digital transformation was all the rage you could land and just expand. Now, I think you have to have that conversation especially in the larger transaction and we're very, very well-equipped to do that. Thank you, Tyler. And Phil, just on the idea of the global financial crisis and COVID comparing that to this current environment they're all a little bit different, but the one thing that they all have in common is they were absolutely an Elixir for cloud computing. So if you think about the global financial crisis, Phil you remember, I was working with a different software company at that time. And I tell the story in that September quarter how I saw a \u20ac1 billion disappears in a day. So it was very sudden. This hasn't been a sudden. And actually COVID evolved a little less suddenly as well. But that was the moment where everything moved to the cloud. Remember, everything became OpEx. All budgets were controlled by the line of business executive. Well now, as you got through the global financial crisis and cloud computing, became the pervasive computing theme of the 21st century, cloud as would got you, through COVID because everybody had to work virtually and you had to enable productivity in a completely digital world because nobody was doing business in person. Again, cloud got you through it. And this one here what you're going to see is cloud just gets reinforced. And I've always said that the infrastructure moves to the cloud, the hyperscalers will all do great in this environment. And then there's only a couple of other SaaS platforms that matter. And while it may be a little bit lumpier in a macro that's reprioritizing things, those five platforms that have been defined by the marketplace will I believe do extremely well in this environment. And it will be yet another proof point that it's all about the cloud. Thank you, Phil. And Keith... Go ahead with your last question. Go ahead. No, no Keith I don't want to miss your opportunity to get something. I just wanted to offer something to build on what Gina is saying like we never talk about this, but we've run the company on the ServiceNow platform. It's not an employee out of almost 20,000 people that know that we have anything, but to ServiceNow platform. So for example when you're hiring it's pretty nice to know in real time where the money is moving in terms of the market and what it takes to hire the best-in-class talent and how you can adjust the ratios of salary versus equity and these kinds of things. That for a large company can be millions and millions of dollars. It's pretty nice to run on a platform that's the leanest in terms of the G&A component of it in the industry. So there are many aspects of the ServiceNow platform that we're actually putting to work on the agility side for the savings that we're putting forward and managing operational excellence can hold our margin rate. And a lot of companies could never do that on the fly. So that's a very interesting observation. The second thing I just wanted to say like, just out of all respect for all shareholders like between love and respect our shareholders, you have no issues with this company on renewals and the cohort from Q3 to Q4. It follows the historical path. It's just that we never outlook that way. So why start now? But I think we should give you every confidence that the company is in great shape and you don't need to lose any sleep. Thank you. Yeah. So first of all on our capital allocation strategy, there is no change to the strategy at this time. The $11 billion plus and the $16 billion plus with regards to 2024 and 2026 respectively. As Gina said, we reinforced that that's based upon our current strategy and no change to it. I also would say that we have done tuck-ins and that's business as usual. One of them that is co-fired really is Hitchworks and we did that because the employee experience now matters more than ever. And managing employees and their capabilities to the productivity needs and the project needs that different companies are managing are really, really important priority now. So it's those kinds of things where it makes sense to one of our core platforms. It's what the customer wants. It's the tuck in. That's the kind of thing that we would look to do. I do acknowledge that you bring up a good point. We're in a very strong position when Gina gave you the cRPO with the RPO at $11.5 billion and the cash is $5.4 billion. We know that's only going to grow over time. So we're watching everything. But right now there's absolutely no change to the strategy. You're welcome. And Alex in our customer relationships, the relationship with the customers couldn't be better. If you live a customer set you look at Net Promoter Score, you look at the retention rate the Gina 99-plus. And it's absolutely the standard in the industry. And if you look at Q2 specifically and you say, where did you see what? As Gina has said, last couple of weeks of June, you saw some deals elongate their cycles based upon higher levels of authority having to approve them and you saw that more in Europe than you saw in other geographies. So that's it in a nutshell. And as it relates to the guide the guide like Gina has said assumes a continuation of that to ensure we had this level based on our customers dealing with their macro because that's what enterprise companies do. We serve them so they can serve their customers. And we factored that into the guide again, it's restoring the 2022 guide. We don't know FX is an issue across the industry. And we all know that we've heard our customers are dealing with a tougher macro that's in the numbers. I'm not worried at all about Gina's guide on the Q3 or the cohort conversation going into Q4. We're in great shape. We really are in great shape. So don't take waiting for it a little bit longer as any lack of strength. On the contrary, we're seeing signs that it's making us even stronger. Thank you, Alex. Well, thank you very much Brad. There's no question that all of those dimensions are really super important. But this low-code revolution if you think about companies having to build 750 million net new applications in the next two years you have to say that that's one that we should do a call out on especially since we have the best low-code platform in the business. There's nobody that's going to back off on taking care of their customers and having a predictive way of managing their relationships with their customers and to make sure the promise that's made in the engagement layer can be kept in the full value chain of mid and back office operations. So, you deliver the right product at the right price point configurations in the right place at the right time. And then you service that customer and that account very carefully. Every company wants to do that. And I can tell you the employee experiences piece super, super important because you have to make every employee to have more productive. And then if you're not going to have the employee number that you expected because you have to deal with the macro you're going to have to apply automation. So I think this experience of the knowledge worker and how you enable them to work from any place and be extremely happy and productive, because you don't want them to turn over. And certainly you got to get it more out of each one, so you own automation. And I don't think any company will argue with that. And then on the IT side, I mean, it is the marquee jewel of our company and it just keeps chugging along and growing and growing and growing. And one of the areas that has really taken off is asset manager, because companies have to be very careful on how they manage their assets. They have to get all the value out of their assets. So they have to bring their assets in and they have to retire their assets, and they have to do that in a highly sustainable way, which is something that Gina have championed along with CJ for the company on ESG. And that's a really fast-growing business for us. And security operations, if you look at having all security operations on one pane of glass, because security is an issue at the C level in every company. And it's not because they haven't invested. They've invested so much in so many different things that they need one thing that can pull it all together, so they have visibility on an end-to-end basis to secure their operations and that's been just growing so, so fast for us. And I do want to give a shout out to Ben and Lightstep. I mean, the logos that they win is just on real. So when you think of observability and the areas that Lightstep and Ben are driving in the best brands in the world, the most innovative brands in the world is pretty compelling. And again, that's all part of our IT category. So they're all doing very, very well. Thank you very much for the question, Brad. Yes. Thank you very much Derrick. As you know this is the time of the year for the government business couldn't be more confident. I could tell you couldn't possibly be more confident and what we're seeing in federal state and local. In terms of our commercial business, very, very good. And if you look at our industries, we're very bullish on all of them. And I'm also very -- I'm very happy that we put industries as a priority for CJ and the whole engineering team to link the industry domain expertise of great development in cloud services to the solution experts that actually interface with the account executive in comporting the best possible, road mapping and account plan for every customer we have including how our partners in ServiceNow deliver that impact of business value. That value chain has fully been realized in its structure and its execution and we actually expect now to start getting some real returns out of that in the back half and beyond. So, we're real strong on all the dimensions that you mentioned. And really, really can't be more confident. Thank you, Derrick And Peter, one stat that may be interesting to you. Even where we have, as Gina has said, a great customer relationship and we're expanding along the lines of that platform, we're only 15% penetrated. So if you look at the product portfolio and the innovation that's come out of our engineering team, we in every count have so far to go against our bill and material to that road map. And all of that is upside in the Global 2000. And it also gives us permission to take it way beyond the Global 2000 as well, in our commercial business and our kind of inside selling business and some of the partnerships that we've built taking advantage of co-selling, with some of the bigger companies in the world will also be an interesting thing to keep an eye on.: Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much, Pat. One of the things I said is I'll be in Japan as we do our Tokyo release. And I'm doing that because Japan is a major market and we intend to treat Japan as one of the most important regions in our company. And that's the world's third largest market as measured by GDP and we intend to do extremely well there. I'll also spend 2.5 weeks going across APJ. I'll be in Europe and obviously across the Americas. So I think the most important thing and I've made this very clear to our management team is to take it to The Street. So I will be taking it to The Street. After we're done with this we have an all hands meeting, where we'll talk to 19-plus thousand of our closest friends, around our great Board meeting and now our wonderful opportunity to talk to our investors and now it's all about the customers. So when we take this level of passion to The Street it's usually very good things happen. Thank you very much, Pat."

            "name": "Gina Mastantuono",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. In Q2, we beat the high-end of both our constant currency subscription revenue growth and operating margin guidance while maintaining our best-in-class renewal rate at 99%. Our business remains strong. Our opportunity is greater than ever. However, as Bill highlighted, our customers are feeling the effects of the macro environment. So what are we doing? What ServiceNow always does. We're putting our customers front and center to deliver a great experience so they can retain their customers, to drive productivity so they can bend the curve on the bottom line, to reinvent their business model, so they can innovate to win and come out of this moment stronger than ever. We're continuing to invest in our powerful go-to-market and incredible R&D organization to drive future growth while keeping both hands on the wheel and being disciplined with spend. We're leaning into our people path our commitment to our amazing employees so they can do their best work and we can fulfill our purpose together. This is what the ServiceNow culture is all about. Turning to our Q2 results. Subscription revenues were $1.658 billion growing 29.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an over 300 basis point acceleration in growth year-over-year. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO is approximately $5.75 billion representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. At the end of June, we started to see customers elevate larger spend decisions to the C-suite resulting in elongated deal cycle. We've already closed several of those deals in July. And as Bill noted, this access to the C-suite has resulted in even greater exposure to the capabilities of the Now Platform. Our renewal and net expansion rates remained very strong. Our renewal rate was 99% in Q2 for all regions demonstrating the resilience of our business. The Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We finished the quarter with 1,463 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. And our largest customers continue to expand with us. We have now more than 100 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV, up more than 50% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom led all other verticals growing net new ACV 100% year-over-year and our Better Together go-to-market positioning continue to resonate as we closed 54 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV with 16 of our top 20 deals containing five or more products. Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 23%, one point above our guidance driven by operating efficiencies partially offset by FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 16%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.4 billion in cash and investments. Together these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of growth and profitability. Before I move to guidance, let me give you some context as to how we're thinking about the months ahead. While our business remains resilient, we do expect the elongated deal cycles that we experienced in the last couple of weeks of June to persist for the remainder of the year. We have factored that into our updated guidance. Additionally, which I know is no surprise to any of you, we've continued to see an incremental strengthening of the US dollar resulting in further FX headwinds for the second half of the year. We expect the total FX impact to be a $220 million headwind for 2022 subscription revenues and a $180 million headwind for Q3 cRPO. We have a well-diversified customer base with over 80% of our business in large global enterprises. As a result, we expect to sustain our best-in-class renewal rates. Over 85% of our new business comes from existing customers, which drives our robust net expansion and predictable growth. We also continue to see a very strong pipeline at our recent Knowledge event, which some of you attended in Q2, we drove a 40% increase in pipeline year-over-year. We're confident that we're appropriately factoring in the macro trends as we see them today and will continue to be transparent as the remainder of the year unfolds. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. Primarily to reflect the incremental $87 million headwind we're seeing from FX since the end of March, we now expect subscription revenues between $6.915 billion and $6.925 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. That's 28% growth on a constant currency basis in line with the original outlook that we provided in January. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect an operating margin of 25%, as we currently plan to offset an approximate one point impact from FX with operational efficiencies and disciplined spend management. We will continue to monitor FX rates over the next couple of quarters. We now expect free cash flow margin of 30%, reflecting slightly lower collection as we expect to provide greater payment flexibility to support our customers when they need us most in this current environment. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $203 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.755 billion representing 23% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a 450 basis point FX headwind. On a constant currency basis, we expect subscription revenue growth to be approximately 27.5%. We expect cRPO growth of 20% year-over-year or 23.5% on a constant currency basis. As I've discussed in prior quarters, this reflects about two points of headwind and due to our larger than average customer cohort that renews in Q4. Excluding this headwind, our constant currency cRPO growth would be 25.5%. We expect an operating margin of 25%, and we expect $23 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. Finally, we remain very confident in achieving our 2024 and 2026 subscription revenue target of $11 billion plus and $16 billion plus that we provided at our Analyst Day in May. Our long-term trajectory has not changed. In conclusion, ServiceNow has established itself as an enduring platform. Our execution is proven and we continue to lean into our great opportunity with operational rigor. We're accelerating our development cycles with our September Tokyo release, to launch the powerful new products that our customers need now. We're doubling down and expanding our go-to-market programs for customers, including our top 250 key accounts to help them recognize value with greater business agility. We're being prudent with OpEx, but remain bullish on hiring go-to-market resources and the critical innovation roles necessary for future growth. And as always we will remain disciplined, as we evaluate our investments to ensure we generate the greatest ROI possible. These actions will enable ServiceNow to continue delivering strong growth and profitability on our way towards our future targets. We remain ever confident in our journey towards becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Before moving on to Q&A, I just want to thank all of our employees around the world, for their incredible dedication and commitment. It's your relentless focus on our customers' needs that makes us ServiceNow strong. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Sure Kash. I'll take the cRPO question first. And if you remember, we've been talking about this for several quarters now that with the renewal cohort that Q3 was going to be the bottom, right? So if you think about a renewal of $1 million at the end of Q4. At the end of Q1, if it comes $750,000; end of Q2 $500,000; and of Q3 only $250,000 it will pop back up in Q4. And so Q3 is absolutely the bottom of that renewal cohort and we'll see that reacceleration as we move into Q4. Thanks, Kash. Yes, Brad. I'll take that the renewal cohort. So, what I'll point to is our continued best-in-class renewal rates. Q3 at 99% across the board in every geography during this macro environment, gives me much confidence that the renewal cohort is solid, right? And so, sometimes we renew early, sometimes we don't. We are having conversations always with our customers to lean in to what they're trying to do and how we can help them back. I really tried to bring that together in the script by talking about how ServiceNow is focused always on the customer first, and we will absolutely continue to do that, and we'll meet our customers where they are always. Sure, great. Tyler sorry about that. So, yes, if you think about the elongated deal cycles, I want to be really clear and transparent as I always try to be with you on how we're thinking about the back half. And so we're assuming that we'll have similar trends through Q3 and Q4 on close rates and elongated deal cycles. What we also are trying to emphasize is that the deals aren't going away, right? They're elongated but many of the deals that were elongated in Q2 have already closed in July. And so those digital transformation tailwinds that we talked about the platform relevancy that we continue to talk about is very relevant and as relevant as ever which is why we felt very confident in reasserting our mid and long-term guide of $11 billion by 2024 and $16 billion by 2026. And so close rate we are taking into account the macro environment that we see in place today. Our customers were leaning in more than ever with our customers and we feel good about our revised guidance that we're taking into account everything that we're seeing in the marketplace today. Thanks Tyler. So I'll take the second part first. And then, I'll pass it over to Bill. So sales productivity remains strong and is better this year than even last year. And so we expect that to hold, Phil and I feel really good about where we're leaning. We certainly have continued to hire feet-on-the-street go-to-market. We're continuing to invest. We are not pulling back at all, on feet-on-the-street hiring. And so we absolutely expect to continue to see similar pace in the back half as we continue to hire quota-bearing sales? Thank you, Phil. Yes, sure. So, listen, I think you're absolutely right and we have the flexibility and the ability, given our best-in-class margin structure to be able to lean in with our customers here, right? And so, I want to be clear, it's slightly lower collections, as we think about assisting our customers. And as you think about industries that probably have a little bit of cash flow or built up working capital, given the supply chain constraints, right? So those are the industries that you would expect to see us leaning in with here. But again it's a small impact to our free cash flow margin that, from our perspective, makes complete sense and it's really purely just timing. There's no concerns with respect to any bad debt assumptions or anything like that. It's just about allowing for and leading into a little bit longer payment terms, given the current macro environment. And so, real strength here. It's all about being proactive and working with our customers. Thank you. So, I think, Keith, listen, I'm not guiding to Q4 now. But what I wanted to make the point and I think, what Kash was trying to allude to as well is, is Q3 the bottom when we think about that renewal cohort and how do we think about the back half, right? And so, you could imagine from our slight return to our January revenue guide that we are absolutely continuing. And I was very explicit in my script that we're factoring in throughout the back half of the year slightly longer deal cycles. And so, that will impact Q4 cRPO. But again just a timing perspective, right? Why we are also very confident in reiterating our mid and long-term goals of $11 billion by 2024 million and $16 billion by 2026. So I know you'd love to hear a Q4 guide. Give us a few more months and we'll give it to you then. Yes. So a couple of things. So we talked pretty explicitly about not slowing down hiring on feet-on-the-street go-to-market and on critical R&D resources, but we are being much more mindful and planful of other kind of support types of roles, as well as, if you think about T&E expense, event expense, marketing things, we're not cutting anything that's driving demand. Just being really smart and disciplined keeping the hands on the steering wheel making sure that we're being disciplined about cost, while really not touching our feet on the street or critical fingers on keyboards engineers. Thanks, Keith. On the clarification and I know everyone wanted to get a few for Board guide for me on cRPO. What I will say is that we expect it to reaccelerate from Q3 and we expect it to reaccelerate by at least two points because that's what the renewal cohort is impacting in Q3. The 23.5. The 23.5 that is the constant currency guide for Q2 -- sorry for Q3 we expect Q4 to increase by at least two points from there. So I'll start with the forecast, right? And so we're not assuming a worsening trend in our cRPO guide from what we saw in the last couple of weeks of June. And so the rate of change when the issues start showing up, it was very late in the quarter and we are assuming similar assumptions in Q3 and Q4, so no worsening trends. In fact July looks strong. A lot of those deals have closed. And as Bill articulated some actually closed at a higher bill of materials than initially assumed. And so similar assumptions for Q3 and Q4 and this is after, Alex rigorous analysis of pipeline trends, rigorous analysis by industry. Coverage rate ratios look strong. And so very similar to what we saw in the last couple of weeks of June is our assumption and what we're seeing through July. On the free cash flow, the 30% includes the flexibility that I'm talking about. I do not expect further deterioration from that point. Thanks, Alex. Operator We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. And I would just add to that, the largest industries we play in if you think about financial services industry \u2013 energy, sorry, public sector federal telcom. These are all industries that holds up I know most resilient in these environments. And so, feel really good about the industry perspective. Said Q3 going into Q3 feel really strong. In particular, we had great results and impact even in Q2 in the Fed business. We saw really strong demand for that new solution. So as we're going into Q3, the federal team has ramped up and very excited. And so really across the board from an industry perspective federal, as well as the G2K very strong. \nQ \u2013 Derrick Wood: Thank you. Thank you, Derrick Yes. A few things there. So first of all, you're absolutely correct, right? We talked about 99% renewal rates across the board in every geo in Q2. We're also seeing exactly, what you're seeing on expansion rates, remain extremely high even at our scale even with our customers who have been with us for so long. The reason for that Peter, is exactly what we're talking about. It's the breadth and scope of our incredible product portfolio, right? It's the expansion out of IT, into HR, into customer, into creator. It's about the platform evolution story. And that is more powerful today, than ever before. And so you'll continue to see similar levels of renewal, expansion rates as we continue to innovate, as we continue to make our platform stronger and better and more capable and as we continue to innovate where customers need us and want us to go. Thank you. Thanks, Pat."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Darren Yip, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nDarren Yip: Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow's first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our first quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today, we're pleased to once again report results that firmly beat expectations. In January we reported a stellar 2021. Today, we're following that up with a very strong Q1.  The constant currency numbers speak for themselves. Subscription revenue growth was 29%, CRPO growth was 30.5%, operating margin surpassed 25%. And all were above the high end of our guidance range. In fact, our raised guidance today which Gina will cover shortly also speaks for itself. As does the 52 deals over $1 million in Q1 that were up 41% year-over-year. It's clear that the world is beginning to understand the power of this platform. We said in January that our fast growth would accelerate in Q1, it did. Now, three months later, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate for the full year, it will.  We said that ServiceNow's fast growth would continue to be paired with the leverage of a global market leader. Now, with our accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow, we're already approaching the rule of 60 for the full year. We have strong adoption from existing and net new customers. Our rolling four quarter pipeline remains ever strong. We're delivering predictable, fast growth with exceptional free cash flow.  Overall, we're super excited about the state of this business. We believe it sets us up really well, for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.  I do want to offer a few comments on what we're seeing in the broader marketplace. We've talked about a sustained demand environment for the enterprise. While there are significant challenges in the world, particularly in the Eastern European situation, we have not seen a material impact on our market. To the contrary, the challenges have underscored the urgency of investment in digital business.  IDC continues to see a 23% year-over-year increase in the global public cloud market for 2022. We see similar indications of demand durability, which are consistent with or above the tenure pre COVID average. Leaders who do plan to adjust their technology budget plan to increase investments in 2022. One leader put it well. He said Bill, if we slow investment in the short term, we'll lose ground in the midterm, and we won't be in business for the long term and quote.  And the data tells the same story. The average tenure of a company in the S&P 500 has declined from 30 years in 1996 to 19 years in 2021. So it's very clear that business can no longer revert to a status quo posture, no matter the environment. We're now in a tech to compete world. If you look to our new customer acquisition, here is what resonates.  Businesses is shifting investments in technologies that get them to the right outcomes faster. Cloud native platforms like ServiceNow are seen as an elixir to speed up new revenue streams and better experiences for people.  When we say increase focus on topics like supply chain, risk, security, ESG, all of these convert who's perceived what was perceived headwinds into much stronger secular tailwinds for service now, so the world's biggest problems are really ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. And it all adds up to what we said consistently. The technology architecture is now the business architecture. This is the era for digital business.  Our businesses are firing on all cylinders in this environment, behind great experiences or great workflows, which underscores the unique extensibility of the ServiceNow platform. So here it is. Our core technology workflows business performed well in Q1, ITSM was in 11 of our top 20 deals, which continued strong adoption of ITSM Pro. We continue to see strong attach rates from ITOM in 13 of our top 20 deals. Security and Risk had a great quarter with a combined 13 deals in the top 20. Global biotech innovator, Regeneron, works with ServiceNow to increase productivity while decreasing costs. Global financial leader, RBC, works with ServiceNow for cloud and asset tracking. I'd also like to thank RBC for administering the ServiceNow racial equality fund. The only way for companies to transform the customer experience is to fully integrate their employee experience. Customer workflows continue to see strong demand, particularly with our vertical SKUs. Barclays works with ServiceNow to automate cross-agency case management and compliance with EU data privacy requirements. In this post-pandemic economy, many businesses are creating direct-to-consumer business models. Companies like Telefonica Brazil work with ServiceNow to better serve their next-generation customers. Employee workflows were also strong in the quarter. HR was in 14 of the top 20 deals. Global health care solutions company, AmerisoBergen, works with ServiceNow to transform their employee experience. In the digital business era, differentiation can't be bought, it must be built. IDC now forecasted 750 million net new applications will be created between 2023 and 2025. With the unprecedented demand for net new innovation together with a global shortage of professional developers, low-code application development is a massive market opportunity. While tech leaders see the value of citizen developers, they don't want to sacrifice the enterprise-grade governance and security. This is what gives ServiceNow a unique differentiation in the low-code market. Look at Daichi Life Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance companies, which is standardized on app engine for all low-code application development. With creative workflows in 16 of the top 20 Q1 deals, we see this trend accelerate. A leading manufacturer of print inks, DIC, works with ServiceNow as their new citizen developer platform, one of many such examples. Here's the key takeaway, businesses are no longer in the mood to experiment. They go with what they know works, which is why the world works with ServiceNow. We are the only one with a fully integrated platform architecture that can address every C-suite business challenge because enterprises are so focused now on fast time to value. Our new customer success subscription offering, ServiceNow Impact, also saw a strong demand in Q1. And as ever, the ServiceNow platform is the foundation for our ongoing success. We're encouraged by the extremely favorable reception from our San Diego platform release. In particular, users love the next experience, which streamlines navigation, make search intelligent and simplifies personalization all on our platform. We also unveiled a new automation engine, which makes it simple for users to do robotic process automation on the ServiceNow platform. Only ServiceNow can help businesses unify their approach to hyper automation. We now orchestrate AI, RPA and other key technologies on a single local platform. Fred Luddy founded our company in San Diego. So this release was an especially proud moment for all of us. I'd like to personally salute our product and engineering teams for the transformational work they delivered in our San Diego release. Congratulations, team. Outstanding job. Looking forward, we see many positive developments that affirm our confidence in this business. Investment from our partner ecosystem continues to accelerate nicely. Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro, said the following, \"Bill, we couldn't be more excited about the potential of ServiceNow. You bring a whole new dimension to customer success and technology innovation. We are all in.\" This outstanding partnership with Wipro is only just getting started. We also have our signature event series, Knowledge 22, taking place in May. Each of four locations will demonstrate the high enthusiasm of the growing ServiceNow community. We will have showcases in The Hague, New York City, Sydney and Las Vegas, in addition to a fully digital experience. So please join us. So in closing, we had a great Q1. Everything is lined up for us to follow suit in Q2 and for the full year. We're taking steps forward every day to our stated milestone, $10 billion-plus by 2024, $15 billion-plus by 2026 and beyond. It's worth reiterating at this time that we remain on track to be the fastest ever to hit those thresholds. Finally, beyond the business results, I'd like to offer the heartfelt support of our more than 18,000 ServiceNow colleagues worldwide to those confronting humanitarian crisis, especially in Ukraine. Like so many of our customers and peers, ServiceNow is pursuing numerous opportunities to support relief efforts. By continuing to do well, we confer to commit our company to doing good. This is firmly aligned to our purpose of making the world work better for everyone. Herein lies our path to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Ladies and gentlemen, we are a company on the move. I'd like to thank you again for your time and your trust in ServiceNow. We're looking forward to addressing any questions you may have. And I'll now hand it over to our great CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina?\nGina Mastantuono : Thank you, Bill. Q1 was yet another fantastic quarter of execution. Enterprises are navigating a macro environment filled with a myriad of challenges. Our ability to continue delivering strong results exemplifies the resiliency of our business and the mission-critical nature of the NOW platform. The breadth of our product offering and our geographic reach provide us a diverse array of opportunities for growth. Although FX headwinds grew throughout the quarter, ServiceNow outperformed across all of our Q1 guidance metrics. In fact, net new ACV growth accelerated year-over-year, driving the fastest Q1 growth we've seen since 2018. We expect that momentum will carry into Q2 with net new ACV growth consistent with our very strong second quarter last year. As a result, we're raising the midpoint of 2022 subscription revenue guidance to more than offset these incremental FX headwinds. Turning to Q1 results. Subscription revenues were $1.631 billion, growing 29% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $16 million. This reflects a 300 basis point acceleration in growth year-over-year. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion, representing 31.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.69 billion, representing 30.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 1-point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, we saw broad-based strength with energy and utilities, financial services, government, health care, life sciences, TMT, and transportation and logistics all growing net new ACV 40% or more year-over-year. Our renewal rate was best-in-class at 98% in Q1 as the NOW platform remains a core component of our customers' digital transformation efforts. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon as our largest customers continue to expand. We finished the quarter with more than 1,400 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. We closed 52 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in Q1, up 41% year-over-year. This includes seven net new logo deals in the quarter, further demonstrating our success with initiatives to land quality customers. Our portfolio outside of ITSM is also leading more of our largest customer land. Nine out of our top 10 new customer deals were led by non-ICSM products. Turning to profitability. Operating margins surpassed 25%, driven by our revenue beat and certain spend that shifted into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 45%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments, putting us in excellent shape to continue investing in strategic initiatives that drive growth. Together, these results demonstrate our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. And perhaps even more relevant this year is resiliency and predictability of our business model. While a diversity of markets and customers provide stability in our results, the diversity of our employee base continues to make us even stronger. Last week, we released our second annual Global Impact Report. Just as the ServiceNow platform helps us fully integrate customer, employee and technology experiences across our business, we'll continue to use the ServiceNow ESG management and reporting solutions to manage, govern and report our progress. While we're early in our ESG journey, we're extremely proud of our accomplishments in such a short time.  We've made significant improvements in representation and hiring. We've tied executive compensation to both environmental and diversity goals. We fully distributed ServiceNow's $100 million racial equity fund, and we've continued to achieve systemic pay equities. I'm happy with the progress we've made in 2021, but we're just getting started. Moving on to guidance. As the conflict in Ukraine intensified throughout Q1, we continue to see an incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in further FX headwinds in 2022. However, on a constant currency basis, the underlying health of our business has remained ever strong. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our subscription revenue outlook by $23 million to more than offset the incremental $20 million headwind we're seeing from FX, resulting in a net increase of $3 million. Our new range of $7.025 billion to $7.04 billion represents 26% year-over-year growth. That's 28.5% growth on a constant currency basis, a 50 basis point raise versus our previous outlook. This reflects our updated expectation for constant currency growth to now accelerate year-over-year. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, operating margin of 25% and free cash flow margin of 31%. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 204 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.67 billion and $1.675 billion representing 26% year-over-year growth, which is inclusive of a 3-point FX headwind. On a constant currency basis, we expect subscription revenue growth to be 29%, a 250 basis point acceleration from Q2 2021. We expect CRPO growth of 25% year-over-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. I'd note that for full year 2022, we have a larger-than-average customer cohort that renews in Q4. We will see between one and two points of increasing headwinds to Q2 and Q3 CRPO growth as those contractual obligations wind down. When the cohort renews, though, in Q4, those headwinds will subside, and we expect CRPO growth to reaccelerate quarter-over-quarter. We expect an operating margin of 22%, which reflects the timing of marketing spend that shifted from Q1 into Q2 and some incremental FX. We expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, Q1 was another outstanding quarter. Our momentum is setting us up for a great year. As Bill highlighted, we're excited about our San Diego release. Our future innovation pipeline is robust, as we seek to extend our market leadership, deepening our competitive moat as the platform for digital business. ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  I'd like to invite you all to hear more about the momentum we're seeing and learn more about our new products and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 24 in Las Vegas. Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication.  And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question and a really nice quarter. Actually, two questions. One, just on kind of the overall macro backdrop and how you guys are kind of performing so well against that. One, is there any geographic differences? Like are you seeing any difference in sort of behavior in Europe versus behavior in the U.S. or Asia Pac? Or is it pretty much consistent across the board? And two, is there any -- like if you think about this period of time versus what we saw in 2020, right, and we were dealing with the COVID pandemic, are there any similarities or differences to point to in terms of what you're seeing now versus what you saw then?\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much, Keith. First of all, in terms of then and now, in both cases, the world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. And if you remember, we stepped right up to the emergency response, returned to work safely. And that really spurred on a whole new business for ServiceNow, but more importantly, to establish the brand as a leader. The case is also true now. The war in Ukraine, the rising inflationary environment, interest rates and dislocated supply chains, these are all opportunities for the NOW platform because this is the unique attribute of ServiceNow. We're an enterprise software market leader. Most of the companies, where they have felt the negative impacts of the environment, have a consumer business that will be probably impacted from these forces, but the enterprises are basically saying it's a tech to compete world, and I have to invest now because I'm already, in many cases, falling behind. For example, just two years ago, one-third of the business was getting done in digital formats. Today, it's two-third and two years, it will be 90-plus percent. So if you don't get digital fast, you lose.  The other thing, we're in a war for talent in the global economy, like that's never been seen before at this level. And there's unique attributes of how the software has to take care of the people. You have to recruit them, hire them, but you have to onboard them. That's one of the moments of truth that nobody does the way we do it. So they feel part of the culture and where they're working from. And then, of course, you have to give the consumer great experience to differentiate you. That is also true for the customer on a direct-to-consumer level and obviously creating the gaps on the low-code platform. So what I'm saying is, the world needs these problems solved, so we can help manage those macro effects that you're talking about. So the environment feels somewhat like it did then in that context, but we're redoubling our focus and our optimism across all employees anywhere in the world because all of our customers need us. So again, I think the unique differentiation is our clear focus on the enterprise and our consistent innovation. And on the geography scenario, it obviously will vary by quarter here and there. They're all strong. Americas was particularly strong, but all of our regions have strong pipelines and every reason to believe that it will be a consistent across-the-board effort everywhere in the world.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Congratulations on a really nice quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a real nice quarter here. The thing that really stands out to me is just the broad strength that you're seeing across different departments, ITSM, employee workflows, ITOM, security risk. These are multiple lines of business. My question is, what has changed about the go-to-market such that you're able to bridge the gap across so many different departments and find relevance for your solutions there? Is the global SI channel a key to that? Are there things that have changed in just your internal go-to-market as well? Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Brad, thank you for your kind words, and also, you're on to something here. We became a platform company, Brad. We started out in IT and where you have a very proud technical excellence for the IT leaders around the world. And they really get behind ServiceNow in a big way because they know it works. And what happened along the way with this digital transformation world that we're living in right now, IT really became the business strategy because it's the only way to keep your business secure. It's the only way to make sure your employees can get what they need to do their work no matter where they're working from. It's the only way to reach out and innovate with those new next-generation customers who will only do business with you digitally. And ultimately, this creative workflow is massive because the number of applications that will be developed in the next three years supercede the number that have been built in the last half century. And there's not enough engineers in the world to do that, and they're doing that in record numbers on ServiceNow. But here is the big difference. When we became the platform company, the leaders that believes in us that were generationally from the IT environment wants to grow with ServiceNow. I can do all this on one architecture, one platform, one data model, and I can give all the constituents of our enterprise with the need to win, whether they're in the HR department, sales and marketing, they couldn't be in the field service or they could just simply be citizen developers trying to do something to help the company. And now I can do all that but govern it, make sure it's compliant and make sure the innovation is always tethered to the investments we've made in the past, so we can have a brighter future. And that's the big difference. And internally, we've moved to a solutions by industry and persona and business impact company along the lines of that platform, and everybody is super excited about where we're going.\nBrad Sills: That\u2019s great to hear. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Your line is open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you very much. And I will add my congrats on a great quarter. Bill, maybe I want to follow up on your conversation about inflation earlier. I'm sure you're seeing hosting costs go up, labor costs are increasing. At the same time, right, with your product, you're adding more value to customers.  You've talked about ServiceNow being a deflationary platform, I mean you're innovating. But how do you think about pricing in this environment for your solution? Is there an opportunity to be more aggressive as you add more value and to try to maybe offset some of the costs that are increasing on the OpEx side?\nBill McDermott: No, it's a really good question, Arjun. I think the main thing to take away from this is when you are in a privileged position because the technology has such a strong advantage, in software, if you do it right, you shouldn't have discount thresholds that behave like doing it wrong. So in software, if you can control your pricing algorithm and make sure that you're getting the price you deserve for your product because it has a well-constructed business impact that's been clearly defined with the customer, you find that you can actually improve price/performance without exacting large enterprise change to the customer. And that's what we're really seeing. We're really seeing a professionalism around how we comport our story, the power and impact of the platform and how we can make that fully transparent to our customers. And we even invented an application that they're using on their business iPhones right now where they can see the impact of the projects they do with ServiceNow and the return on those investments as they are tethered to the original business case that was done at the point of sale. That's the level of precision that I'm unaware of another enterprise company operating on. So it's really about value. It's really about business impact, and our customers are buying in.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Hi, thanks. Gina I just wanted to give you a chance to elaborate on the U-shape CRPO trajectory in 2022. And in particular, I just wanted to clarify the 1 to 2-point sequential headwind to that metric. So does that mean that the 28% guide in 2Q would be maybe 29%, 30% normalized? And then in 3Q, do you get another 1- to 2-point headwind before you get that acceleration in 4Q? Love any color you can provide, as I think others on the call would. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Karl. That's exactly right. And so basically, what we're saying is that there's a 1- to 2-point impact in Q2 and Q3 because of this new -- this large renewal cohort. And so if you think about a renewal and a customer that at the end of Q4 2021 had $1 million. And that's up for renewal in Q4 in 2022, in Q4 of last year, the RPO would have had $1 million, then in Q1, it would have had $750,000. Then in Q2, it would have had $500 million; Q3, $250,000. So that's the impact that we're talking about. And we've quantified it for you at between 1% to 2%, and you've got it exactly right how you're talking about it with the math.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, super helpful. Thanks Gina.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nPhilip Winslow: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another just outstanding quarter. Bill, thanks for all the color you gave on just the feedback you're getting from customers in terms of just the prioritization of IT spending and ServiceNow. And it really doesn't feel like you're leaning into that opportunity. When I look at sales and marketing head count, that's up 25% year-over-year.  My question is, I guess, twofold. One, what are your goals just for hiring in this line for the year? And are there any areas where you think ServiceNow is going to be leaning into, whether it be geographic or vertical functionality? And then Gina, I wonder if you could just comment on the sales productivity ramp time that you're seeing?\nBill McDermott: Phil, thank you very much, Phil. What's really wonderful about ServiceNow is we just crossed our 18,000th employee that we'll be onboarding in the next week or so. So we continue to be the place people want to work. And that's super exciting because in this environment, I get phone calls from other Boards of Director members telling me there's no boomerang going back to their company from ServiceNow because people are choosing so many options within the ServiceNow family. As you know, we hired very heavily in R&D. This is an innovation machine. It's a growth machine. And we also are cognizant of sales and marketing to make sure that the things we do tend to have a quota-carrying equation associated with them. So the leverage is there for shareholders. So Gina will give you some of the facts and figures on it. But I just think it's super important to have a brand that's the place people want to be, especially in this very, very tight labor market for digital skills.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. And I would just add, Phil, that you're seeing the numbers, Q1 headcount up 28% year-over-year in this environment is pretty phenomenal, and hats off to our HR function and recruiting function and all of the teams for being able to do that. But you're seeing it right. We continue to invest in sales and marketing and R&D. It's really about driving innovation and sales and marketing, really getting that strong go-to market, that we have been talking about. We talked about for the full year expecting hiring in the high 20s, and we're absolutely on that trajectory to continue that. With respect to productivity with the sales folks, we're definitely seeing good productivity increases year-over-year in Q1 and expect to see that continue throughout the year. So go-to-market teams are executing very well. We feel really good about the results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on just another very great quarter for you guys in a tough environment. Maybe during the quarter, we went to the Federal Forum. And it was great to see attendance there be very robust. It felt like we were back to the pre-COVID times. And I'm just curious, have you seen the demand to match that and particularly with the higher DoD IL-5 level certification. How should we think about that in terms of opening up new opportunities and expanding the TAM within the federal sector that you're targeting?\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much, Samad, first of all, for attending. We really appreciate it. As you know, that forum was really successful. It was done in person, and it was the most successful Federal Forum we've ever had, and it happened post the COVID in the sense that people started to travel a little bit again. I think you called it really well. I think the big sensational outcome from that was not only that U.S. federal saw 100% growth on a year-over-year basis in what we refer to as net new average contract value. But you also see the certification on IL-5 really taking off, and I believe that our partnership with Microsoft will show up very big, specially congratulate Microsoft and Satya on having a very strong quarter. I wish him well. It's fantastic. And we have very good partnership with them. So I think we can solve a lot of problems for U.S. federal is a big market opportunity. And the President's management agenda and the administration's guide to their constituents is really for the government to deliver results fast, drive digital transformation, and they're adopting the NOW platform as a standard. And we're only one of a couple, there's three total, including Microsoft, that are IL-5 certified. So I think you caught on to something here that could be a wellspring of opportunity. I'll finally close off this workplace service delivery capability of ServiceNow and on a safe workplace applications have seen the strongest interest from federal customers. And again, that's fueled by the Biden administration's agenda. And the quote that I would give you, as I remember it, they said that federal will lead the way to returning to work now. So this is a very strong business for us. Incidentally, that TAM for the government marketplace globally is an enormous TAM, as you know. So being a leader in U.S. federal, also we're doing a lot in state and local, is quite a statement. And I think that, that will drive growth around the world.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Let me comment my congratulations on the spectacular quarter. Bill, I think you've got the macro argument pretty well nailed. I'm not going to ask that question, but I'm curious to get your thoughts as you scale the company to 15-plus, I noticed the plus after 15. How do you think about distribution, given that you've run big distribution of big companies so far? The customer count of 7,000, 8,000 certainly is very impressive, big deal sizes.  As we envision the life beyond 15-plus, what is the go-to-market structure of the company look like? Are we looking at a 2-tier, 3-tier type distribution, predominantly go-to-market, high-end, channel, SI, et cetera? Help us envision the future, Bill, to get to your target. Thank you so much and congrats.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Kash, for the question. So the distribution, I again reiterate, our focus right now is on the enterprise. We're an enterprise software market leader. We have lots of work still left to do in geographic expansion for the company. There's a huge opportunity in markets like Japan, obviously, all across Europe, LatAm. I really like to focus on markets like Canada, of course, trade markets, the way they want to be treated in that localized style. We obviously have lots of expansion rights in the Middle East and other places. And I'm looking at bellwether markets like Germany, France and the U.K., which are already now starting to take off beautiful. So there's a geographic component. We also have segmented the way we develop software and take that software to market by industry. And as you know, we're very focused on your industry, of course, financial services, one, but there's telecom, there's manufacturing, there's every industry under the sun in motion, but we've gone strong with 6, including life sciences and so forth. And then persona-based. If you think about taking this platform across the enterprise, you have to speak intelligently to all the C-level executives that run the enterprise. And we have a Rubik's Cube formula around the geography, the industry and the persona that's now being executed at an art form level by our great marketing communications leader and his team. So I'm super impressed with that. We also did something, I think, very interesting with life step that a lot of people haven't picked up on, but life step is a next-generation customer platform. And when you think about having one user experience across the whole enterprise, where people are in and out different screen styles to figure out what they're observing, you also have an observability platform that is a direct-to-consumer platform by design that I think is a precursor to many of the things we can do with the core.  And also, we could take the core and put it in prepackaged, ready-to-run solutions and build an ecosystem around that and turn on a whole new channel of small and mid-market channel partners as we take the company everywhere. And so now, on the big partner channel, there isn't a single one out there in the top 10 that doesn't at least start with a B, meaning we don't have million-dollar conversations, we have billion-dollar conversations, and we even have the top one now chasing $10 billion. So I mean, Kash, in short, we're going to chase every market opportunity all over the world, and we're going to win. And we have a team that's ready to conquer this market like never before. It's so exciting here right now, Kash. I just wish you could be in the building to see it.\nGina Mastantuono: And on that note, Kash, I hope to see you on May 24 at Investor Day because we'll talk a lot about what we look like at $10 billion and $15 billion-plus. So hope to see you there.\nKash Rangan: I'm already there. Definitely seeing you there.\nBill McDermott: That's great. But can you feel it, Kash? Can you feel the building?\nKash Rangan: I can. Absolutely. Congratulation.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, really as a follow-up to that last question. You mentioned of observability. You guys recently launched incident management platform. I think it's really infused with light step and observability. I'm wondering if you can talk about the importance of that offering. And maybe just double-click again on sort of why you think you're going to win in observability, because it seems like a huge market opportunity for you guys?\nBill McDermott: Well, the first thing to recognize here Matt, is huge market opportunities don't require anyone for -- to lose for us to win. They're huge market opportunities. So we'll still integrate, as we already do, with the largest participants in that market. And we want them to be successful because customers have invested in them and our way of going about things is that's great, let's make that customer successful together. That's why they integrate seamlessly into the NOW platform. At the same time, we have many customers that realize that ServiceNow can out-innovate just about anybody in the marketplace, so they want us to do more for them. And clearly, observability was one of those categories. And we just got there a lot faster with light step because we believe Ben and his team are the most innovative in the industry. And we're just so proud to have such trust and partnership with them and such big dreams together. So Lightstep launched incident response, as you said. It's the first new product since joining ServiceNow, and it's big. So incident response will add a lot of context and automation to the incident response process, and customers are looking for that. And by the way, they may even have more than one incident response vendor in there. So we don't rail against others. What we try to do is work for the customer. We've put our part hard hat on, roll up our sleeves and we go to work. Lightstep also launched an industry-first unification of observed billing analytics, and they also get collaborative notebooks. So these innovations are breaking down those silos I referenced between metrics and tracing and streamlining its critical SRE workflow space. So in Q1, for example, we signed some cool deals along with Plaid, which we're very proud of. And that's a data networking company, as you know, and they're powering the Fintech and digital finance product space, and they're using Lightstep for complete visibility into distributed architectures, and they're allowing Plaid to investigate CI and CV issues, and they're doing it 20 times faster than they used to. And we also got Airtable, again, cool brand, next-generation brand, and they're building collaborative applications, and they're driving the reliability of complex distributed systems and proactively improving performance for users, and again, more effectively monitoring and resolving both system-wide and specific customer issues, but they're doing it with one UI, and they're not balancing people in and out of different experiences. And this is what I keep going back to when you talk about real platform innovation and the integrity of a consumer-grade experience, and you can do that across an entire enterprise. That's why I believe our Board of Directors did a great job of defining enterprise software company in the 21st century is doing it with a DESCO 21C logo. So now we have 18,000 people that all they think about is DESCO 21C, whether you're innovating, covering a customer or just driving the conversation. We know where we're going.\nMatt Hedberg: Well said. Congrats, Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Y our line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on the truly inspiring quarter-end message in a tough tape. I guess maybe just two for me, Bill. You talked about the health of the federal vertical on the call. I was wondering if you could also maybe comment on some of the other verticals that you're seeing success in and saw success in the quarter and how we should think about just greater verticalization in the product itself, either for telco or Fiserv or others? And then just a follow-up for Gina.\nBill McDermott: Sure. Sure. Well, thank you very much, Alex, for your very kind remarks. It means a lot to us. Our team is doing a really great job. And when they hear that, you just inspire us to go higher, and we appreciate it. So thank you. We've done a lot in terms of the vertical coverage. We have our great Chief Operating Officer, CJ Desai, now not only running all of engineering with what we believe to be the best engineering team in the business, but also, he's overseeing our industry orientation and the whole go-to-market around that. And he teams up in a beautiful way with the go-to-market team, our leader Paul Smith and great regional presence. We have just super proud of our team. But banking is really simplifying the whole middle to back-office operation context, and financial services is going really well. I referenced Barclays, but there's just so many that are all-in on ServiceNow. Our telecommunication solution is really aligning customer care and service assurance, transforming -- just think about how communication service providers deliver great customer experiences. And you can't get away with fixing problems anymore. You've got to proactively anticipate these issues before they even come up. And if they do come up, you've got to address them quickly to maximize availability and quality of service. So we're seeing a lot of traction in telecommunications and we're really becoming the standard across the board. We're super happy with manufacturing and what we're doing there, operations technology management, driving the whole notion of what these manufacturers are trying to do to have their critical technology available and provide visibility and security of all of their assets. Another one I would underscore is health care and life sciences service management. How do you connect cross functional health systems and teams and simplify how people engage with the health care providers, payers, pharma companies and medical device organizations? It's all about the patient experience. And high-tech manufacturing, another one that's really come on strong for us. I mean I could give you more, but those are the ones that are just rocking right now. And one theme I will give you is you can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience unless you first give it to your employees. And the NOW platform is really controlling the conversation now for enlightened decision-makers because they're like, I've got to tether my IT excellence to the employee experience, and I've got to take care of my customers in new and highly innovative ways.  And this platform does the magic they need done, but it does it in days or weeks, not months and months and months and years. And finally, in all these solutions, we're cooperating with those systems of record. The customer knows that they're there and they've got them and they're very important to their business. So we just come in quickly and make everything better for everyone.\nAlex Zukin: That's awesome. Very inspiring, Bill. Gina, I guess the follow-up for you, you talked about accelerating growth in new ACV in the quarter. Again, which is quite rare for a company of your size to do quarter in, quarter out, not to mention in this type of macro environment. I guess the question is, as the comps get tougher through the year, but you do start returning to more in-person events, presumably more productivity from the sales force. Is it possible to see that type of new ACV momentum continue?\nGina Mastantuono: So we -- I talked about in my prepared remarks that we expect Q2 to show accelerating net new ACV growth as well, consistent. Whether that lasts for the full year, they're pretty incredible comps. And so we obviously don't guide to full year net new ACV, Alex. But the reason I spoke about it specifically was really because I wanted everyone to feel confident that the CRPO guide, although slightly less than Q1, really had this impact, right? And that it wasn't driving -- it wasn't a result of the underlying business that, in fact, we're seeing accelerating net new ACV in Q1 and expect similar in Q2. So that was the reason for my comment. I'm so proud of our entire organization for being able to drive an acceleration of this scale at our scale. And just really excited about the momentum we're seeing into Q2. We feel really strong and good about the guide for the full year. And the momentum that we're seeing in Q1, we expect to be consistent throughout the year.\nAlex Zukin: Crystal clear guys. Thanks so much. Congratulations. \nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Thanks very much. And I'll add my congrats on a really good quarter. Bill, we all tend to think about ITSM as the workhorse for ServiceNow, but it's interesting that it was only included in 11 of your top 20 deals, which is quite a bit less than what we usually see. And I think you mentioned also that 9 of your top 10 were led by non-ITSM products. So do you look at this Q1 result with respect to this metric as more of an anomalous outcome? Or do you think it's reflective of ServiceNow increasingly landing and expanding with other workflow automation solutions?\nBill McDermott: Gregg, it's a great question. Actually, we're so encouraged with our core. Our core is growing beautifully. And if you look at the revenue outcome from our core, it's right there at the corporate rate. So what you're seeing has nothing to do with any dilution in that core business. On the contrary, we've got enormous uplift with our Pro SKU, as you know. That's a 25% uplift. So it's 30% penetrated now. So there's lots of people that like it and there's many more to go. So we have lots of room left on the Pro SKU. If you think about the kind of customers where we're winning, I mean, the great brands, Amerisource Bergen, Baptist Health, Regeneron, DIC pharma -- I mean it goes on and on. Royal Bank of Canada, Telefonica. Every -- Wipro, for example, just like sort of complete generational change with it. So let me make sure I make it clear. The core business has never been stronger. There's no revenue dilution whatsoever. What is happening, we are landing and expanding. And you're right, the IT concept really did form the basis for us to move into the employee experience, the customer experience, the whole creative workflow where citizen developers are now really creating the future they want to see. And without that ever solid magnificent core, none of that would have been possible. So I want to really set the record straight. Our team is doing great across all these segments. The newer or the younger ones are obviously going to get some more land and expand opportunities. But we love on our core, and we love our leaders.\nGregg Moskowitz: That\u2019s fantastic. Super helpful. Thanks Bill. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. And I'll echo the congrats on a really nice quarter. Bill, when the pandemic hit, you were able to operate at a really high level virtually. But as a platform company, I was curious as to how beneficial it is to be able to actually see your customers in person and talk about the entirety of the solution as well as the ability to sort of move up the organization, meaning moving from the CIO suite up to the CEO level? I was just wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit because I think you're in a little bit different position than some other software companies that maybe only sell into one buying center. Thanks. \nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Kirk. I have to tell you, one thing that did surprise me a little bit during the whole virtual environment is CEOs were looking for a good conversation. So we were able to participate in those conversations then, which is obviously helping us now. And we were also able to bring large-scale management team gatherings with our team and their team, so we did good. But now that we're opening up, we should do even better. So I looked at my calendar for the year, I'll catch my family here and there on a weekend because I'm leaving Sunday for Europe, and after that tour of Europe, we'll hitting Asia very, very soon after that. So we're going full speed, open up the company. We're doing these knowledge events in four distinct locations, as I mentioned. Our sellers are going out on the street, and our management and going out on the street because that's where the customers are. And never forget that United Airlines commercial, when a guy walks in, he's got a bunch of envelopes and looks at his management team. We were sitting around the table, gauging it themselves and it goes, let's go visit some customers. So I expect we're going to get a lot of tailwinds out of that because you're right, to build trust with net new logos, it happens in person. It's hard to do that in a digital format. To really expand the relationship to an enterprise scale, it really does require a good meeting of the minds and emotional trust, and we'll do that. So I really think this is going to be another step function improvement in ServiceNow's future because as a platform provider, getting our customers healthy through some of the challenges that they're fighting through is a seminal moment in our history, and I'm excited.\nKirk Materne: Sounds good. Thanks very much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much. Appreciate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Hey thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about how you're seeing the new impact program roll out to your customers. And clearly, Bill, you talked a lot about some of the new products you're innovating on and delivering a lot of value to customers. But how are you just kind of treading that line between the base increases on existing products versus the new products that you're delivering and making sure that customers are able to take on the scope of new products where you guys are really innovating on? Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Absolutely. I really appreciate the question. So here's the situation. Our customers need help. The impact part of this equation, think of it much more in the value delivery context than any kind of price increase. It's really accelerating the value realization for the customer against the software that they've already invested in and they want to extract as much business impact as they possibly can.  And for too long, these customer relationships across every company you can think of is managed by a deck at a point of sale, and then ultimately, the sale is made and then the consultants come in. But it's kind of like job changes, people do different things, and a year later, someone's saying, \"Hey, how did we do with that implementation again? Did we get what we bargained for?\" And what we're basically doing is making sure that they do and that there's a professional format in doing that. And not just with ServiceNow, but also for our great partners. So just think of this concept as the NOW platform in ServiceNow is the place where every conversation takes place between the partner, the customer and ServiceNow. There's no e-mails, there's no texts, there's no chat on the side. It's all on one platform with everything detailed and spelled out, and we measure everything in real time with all the analytics and all the business outcomes spilled out in a way that could be presented to any Board of Directors. So also on the pricing, again, I want to be clear, like we're not looking to make up for inflationary pressures by putting it on the customer. There are many new customers. There are many more logos. There are many more expansions to our platform. All we want to make sure of is that we do things highly professional, and we know the ranges where our professional expertise should be valued at.  And in that valuing and in that business impact to the customer, a fair agreement is reached. We even developed a pricing structure that enables customers to partner with us and look at the enterprise value of doing things with ServiceNow, not just 1 departmental value. And I think that whole idea of being a solutions and business impact platform company is resonating big time internally and externally. And incidentally, if you're interested, we've done more than 100 deals right now on ServiceNow Impact. And what we're seeing is user adoption is speeding up, values being accelerated and customer Net Promoter and satisfaction is going through the moon. And as Gina said, the retention rates prove it that it's best in the business.\nOperator: We have time for one last question. Your last question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Fantastic. Thanks. So much for fit me in. What a fabulous start to the year guys. Congrats to you. Bill, I really wanted to ask about the new automation engine as part of the San Diego release. Can you remind us of your vision for RPA, what the interest level is and maybe the extent to which these are competitive stand-alone opportunities or more filling in the gaps of workflows that naturally are found on the NOW platform?\nBill McDermott: No, it's a really great question, Brad. Thank you very much. As you know, this idea of hyper automation workflows on the NOW platform means a lot to our existing customers. So what they expect from ServiceNow is to remain that highly innovative unicorn that we have been, one that organically builds better, more substantial product experiences with every passing day. And in some cases, they want us to integrate with other tools in the marketplace. But in other cases, if we can build it and it's all integrated into the NOW platform, they would like ServiceNow to own all of that, and we give them choice. And what you see here in this latest release, we brought together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience. And now customers are going to be quickly innovating and improving the way work flows across the enterprise.  So our job is to be helpful and integrate with all the market participants, especially when customers find that pleasing, but we also need to innovate ourselves and continue to build out this platform story in a way that's super compelling and it's generational. And that's why I said when I first came to ServiceNow, organic is delicious.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome Bill. Thank you, look forward to seeing you out in Vegas next month.\nBill McDermott: Thank you. Thank you very much. I look forward to spend some time together, Brad.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: And this is all the time we have for questions. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. We really appreciate you joining our call today, we're pleased to once again report results that firmly beat expectations. In January we reported a stellar 2021. Today, we're following that up with a very strong Q1.  The constant currency numbers speak for themselves. Subscription revenue growth was 29%, CRPO growth was 30.5%, operating margin surpassed 25%. And all were above the high end of our guidance range. In fact, our raised guidance today which Gina will cover shortly also speaks for itself. As does the 52 deals over $1 million in Q1 that were up 41% year-over-year. It's clear that the world is beginning to understand the power of this platform. We said in January that our fast growth would accelerate in Q1, it did. Now, three months later, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate for the full year, it will.  We said that ServiceNow's fast growth would continue to be paired with the leverage of a global market leader. Now, with our accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow, we're already approaching the rule of 60 for the full year. We have strong adoption from existing and net new customers. Our rolling four quarter pipeline remains ever strong. We're delivering predictable, fast growth with exceptional free cash flow.  Overall, we're super excited about the state of this business. We believe it sets us up really well, for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.  I do want to offer a few comments on what we're seeing in the broader marketplace. We've talked about a sustained demand environment for the enterprise. While there are significant challenges in the world, particularly in the Eastern European situation, we have not seen a material impact on our market. To the contrary, the challenges have underscored the urgency of investment in digital business.  IDC continues to see a 23% year-over-year increase in the global public cloud market for 2022. We see similar indications of demand durability, which are consistent with or above the tenure pre COVID average. Leaders who do plan to adjust their technology budget plan to increase investments in 2022. One leader put it well. He said Bill, if we slow investment in the short term, we'll lose ground in the midterm, and we won't be in business for the long term and quote.  And the data tells the same story. The average tenure of a company in the S&P 500 has declined from 30 years in 1996 to 19 years in 2021. So it's very clear that business can no longer revert to a status quo posture, no matter the environment. We're now in a tech to compete world. If you look to our new customer acquisition, here is what resonates.  Businesses is shifting investments in technologies that get them to the right outcomes faster. Cloud native platforms like ServiceNow are seen as an elixir to speed up new revenue streams and better experiences for people.  When we say increase focus on topics like supply chain, risk, security, ESG, all of these convert who's perceived what was perceived headwinds into much stronger secular tailwinds for service now, so the world's biggest problems are really ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. And it all adds up to what we said consistently. The technology architecture is now the business architecture. This is the era for digital business.  Our businesses are firing on all cylinders in this environment, behind great experiences or great workflows, which underscores the unique extensibility of the ServiceNow platform. So here it is. Our core technology workflows business performed well in Q1, ITSM was in 11 of our top 20 deals, which continued strong adoption of ITSM Pro. We continue to see strong attach rates from ITOM in 13 of our top 20 deals. Security and Risk had a great quarter with a combined 13 deals in the top 20. Global biotech innovator, Regeneron, works with ServiceNow to increase productivity while decreasing costs. Global financial leader, RBC, works with ServiceNow for cloud and asset tracking. I'd also like to thank RBC for administering the ServiceNow racial equality fund. The only way for companies to transform the customer experience is to fully integrate their employee experience. Customer workflows continue to see strong demand, particularly with our vertical SKUs. Barclays works with ServiceNow to automate cross-agency case management and compliance with EU data privacy requirements. In this post-pandemic economy, many businesses are creating direct-to-consumer business models. Companies like Telefonica Brazil work with ServiceNow to better serve their next-generation customers. Employee workflows were also strong in the quarter. HR was in 14 of the top 20 deals. Global health care solutions company, AmerisoBergen, works with ServiceNow to transform their employee experience. In the digital business era, differentiation can't be bought, it must be built. IDC now forecasted 750 million net new applications will be created between 2023 and 2025. With the unprecedented demand for net new innovation together with a global shortage of professional developers, low-code application development is a massive market opportunity. While tech leaders see the value of citizen developers, they don't want to sacrifice the enterprise-grade governance and security. This is what gives ServiceNow a unique differentiation in the low-code market. Look at Daichi Life Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance companies, which is standardized on app engine for all low-code application development. With creative workflows in 16 of the top 20 Q1 deals, we see this trend accelerate. A leading manufacturer of print inks, DIC, works with ServiceNow as their new citizen developer platform, one of many such examples. Here's the key takeaway, businesses are no longer in the mood to experiment. They go with what they know works, which is why the world works with ServiceNow. We are the only one with a fully integrated platform architecture that can address every C-suite business challenge because enterprises are so focused now on fast time to value. Our new customer success subscription offering, ServiceNow Impact, also saw a strong demand in Q1. And as ever, the ServiceNow platform is the foundation for our ongoing success. We're encouraged by the extremely favorable reception from our San Diego platform release. In particular, users love the next experience, which streamlines navigation, make search intelligent and simplifies personalization all on our platform. We also unveiled a new automation engine, which makes it simple for users to do robotic process automation on the ServiceNow platform. Only ServiceNow can help businesses unify their approach to hyper automation. We now orchestrate AI, RPA and other key technologies on a single local platform. Fred Luddy founded our company in San Diego. So this release was an especially proud moment for all of us. I'd like to personally salute our product and engineering teams for the transformational work they delivered in our San Diego release. Congratulations, team. Outstanding job. Looking forward, we see many positive developments that affirm our confidence in this business. Investment from our partner ecosystem continues to accelerate nicely. Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro, said the following, \"Bill, we couldn't be more excited about the potential of ServiceNow. You bring a whole new dimension to customer success and technology innovation. We are all in.\" This outstanding partnership with Wipro is only just getting started. We also have our signature event series, Knowledge 22, taking place in May. Each of four locations will demonstrate the high enthusiasm of the growing ServiceNow community. We will have showcases in The Hague, New York City, Sydney and Las Vegas, in addition to a fully digital experience. So please join us. So in closing, we had a great Q1. Everything is lined up for us to follow suit in Q2 and for the full year. We're taking steps forward every day to our stated milestone, $10 billion-plus by 2024, $15 billion-plus by 2026 and beyond. It's worth reiterating at this time that we remain on track to be the fastest ever to hit those thresholds. Finally, beyond the business results, I'd like to offer the heartfelt support of our more than 18,000 ServiceNow colleagues worldwide to those confronting humanitarian crisis, especially in Ukraine. Like so many of our customers and peers, ServiceNow is pursuing numerous opportunities to support relief efforts. By continuing to do well, we confer to commit our company to doing good. This is firmly aligned to our purpose of making the world work better for everyone. Herein lies our path to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Ladies and gentlemen, we are a company on the move. I'd like to thank you again for your time and your trust in ServiceNow. We're looking forward to addressing any questions you may have. And I'll now hand it over to our great CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina? Well, thank you very much, Keith. First of all, in terms of then and now, in both cases, the world's biggest challenges are ServiceNow's biggest opportunities. And if you remember, we stepped right up to the emergency response, returned to work safely. And that really spurred on a whole new business for ServiceNow, but more importantly, to establish the brand as a leader. The case is also true now. The war in Ukraine, the rising inflationary environment, interest rates and dislocated supply chains, these are all opportunities for the NOW platform because this is the unique attribute of ServiceNow. We're an enterprise software market leader. Most of the companies, where they have felt the negative impacts of the environment, have a consumer business that will be probably impacted from these forces, but the enterprises are basically saying it's a tech to compete world, and I have to invest now because I'm already, in many cases, falling behind. For example, just two years ago, one-third of the business was getting done in digital formats. Today, it's two-third and two years, it will be 90-plus percent. So if you don't get digital fast, you lose.  The other thing, we're in a war for talent in the global economy, like that's never been seen before at this level. And there's unique attributes of how the software has to take care of the people. You have to recruit them, hire them, but you have to onboard them. That's one of the moments of truth that nobody does the way we do it. So they feel part of the culture and where they're working from. And then, of course, you have to give the consumer great experience to differentiate you. That is also true for the customer on a direct-to-consumer level and obviously creating the gaps on the low-code platform. So what I'm saying is, the world needs these problems solved, so we can help manage those macro effects that you're talking about. So the environment feels somewhat like it did then in that context, but we're redoubling our focus and our optimism across all employees anywhere in the world because all of our customers need us. So again, I think the unique differentiation is our clear focus on the enterprise and our consistent innovation. And on the geography scenario, it obviously will vary by quarter here and there. They're all strong. Americas was particularly strong, but all of our regions have strong pipelines and every reason to believe that it will be a consistent across-the-board effort everywhere in the world. Brad, thank you for your kind words, and also, you're on to something here. We became a platform company, Brad. We started out in IT and where you have a very proud technical excellence for the IT leaders around the world. And they really get behind ServiceNow in a big way because they know it works. And what happened along the way with this digital transformation world that we're living in right now, IT really became the business strategy because it's the only way to keep your business secure. It's the only way to make sure your employees can get what they need to do their work no matter where they're working from. It's the only way to reach out and innovate with those new next-generation customers who will only do business with you digitally. And ultimately, this creative workflow is massive because the number of applications that will be developed in the next three years supercede the number that have been built in the last half century. And there's not enough engineers in the world to do that, and they're doing that in record numbers on ServiceNow. But here is the big difference. When we became the platform company, the leaders that believes in us that were generationally from the IT environment wants to grow with ServiceNow. I can do all this on one architecture, one platform, one data model, and I can give all the constituents of our enterprise with the need to win, whether they're in the HR department, sales and marketing, they couldn't be in the field service or they could just simply be citizen developers trying to do something to help the company. And now I can do all that but govern it, make sure it's compliant and make sure the innovation is always tethered to the investments we've made in the past, so we can have a brighter future. And that's the big difference. And internally, we've moved to a solutions by industry and persona and business impact company along the lines of that platform, and everybody is super excited about where we're going. No, it's a really good question, Arjun. I think the main thing to take away from this is when you are in a privileged position because the technology has such a strong advantage, in software, if you do it right, you shouldn't have discount thresholds that behave like doing it wrong. So in software, if you can control your pricing algorithm and make sure that you're getting the price you deserve for your product because it has a well-constructed business impact that's been clearly defined with the customer, you find that you can actually improve price/performance without exacting large enterprise change to the customer. And that's what we're really seeing. We're really seeing a professionalism around how we comport our story, the power and impact of the platform and how we can make that fully transparent to our customers. And we even invented an application that they're using on their business iPhones right now where they can see the impact of the projects they do with ServiceNow and the return on those investments as they are tethered to the original business case that was done at the point of sale. That's the level of precision that I'm unaware of another enterprise company operating on. So it's really about value. It's really about business impact, and our customers are buying in. Phil, thank you very much, Phil. What's really wonderful about ServiceNow is we just crossed our 18,000th employee that we'll be onboarding in the next week or so. So we continue to be the place people want to work. And that's super exciting because in this environment, I get phone calls from other Boards of Director members telling me there's no boomerang going back to their company from ServiceNow because people are choosing so many options within the ServiceNow family. As you know, we hired very heavily in R&D. This is an innovation machine. It's a growth machine. And we also are cognizant of sales and marketing to make sure that the things we do tend to have a quota-carrying equation associated with them. So the leverage is there for shareholders. So Gina will give you some of the facts and figures on it. But I just think it's super important to have a brand that's the place people want to be, especially in this very, very tight labor market for digital skills. Well, thank you very much, Samad, first of all, for attending. We really appreciate it. As you know, that forum was really successful. It was done in person, and it was the most successful Federal Forum we've ever had, and it happened post the COVID in the sense that people started to travel a little bit again. I think you called it really well. I think the big sensational outcome from that was not only that U.S. federal saw 100% growth on a year-over-year basis in what we refer to as net new average contract value. But you also see the certification on IL-5 really taking off, and I believe that our partnership with Microsoft will show up very big, specially congratulate Microsoft and Satya on having a very strong quarter. I wish him well. It's fantastic. And we have very good partnership with them. So I think we can solve a lot of problems for U.S. federal is a big market opportunity. And the President's management agenda and the administration's guide to their constituents is really for the government to deliver results fast, drive digital transformation, and they're adopting the NOW platform as a standard. And we're only one of a couple, there's three total, including Microsoft, that are IL-5 certified. So I think you caught on to something here that could be a wellspring of opportunity. I'll finally close off this workplace service delivery capability of ServiceNow and on a safe workplace applications have seen the strongest interest from federal customers. And again, that's fueled by the Biden administration's agenda. And the quote that I would give you, as I remember it, they said that federal will lead the way to returning to work now. So this is a very strong business for us. Incidentally, that TAM for the government marketplace globally is an enormous TAM, as you know. So being a leader in U.S. federal, also we're doing a lot in state and local, is quite a statement. And I think that, that will drive growth around the world. Thank you very much, Kash, for the question. So the distribution, I again reiterate, our focus right now is on the enterprise. We're an enterprise software market leader. We have lots of work still left to do in geographic expansion for the company. There's a huge opportunity in markets like Japan, obviously, all across Europe, LatAm. I really like to focus on markets like Canada, of course, trade markets, the way they want to be treated in that localized style. We obviously have lots of expansion rights in the Middle East and other places. And I'm looking at bellwether markets like Germany, France and the U.K., which are already now starting to take off beautiful. So there's a geographic component. We also have segmented the way we develop software and take that software to market by industry. And as you know, we're very focused on your industry, of course, financial services, one, but there's telecom, there's manufacturing, there's every industry under the sun in motion, but we've gone strong with 6, including life sciences and so forth. And then persona-based. If you think about taking this platform across the enterprise, you have to speak intelligently to all the C-level executives that run the enterprise. And we have a Rubik's Cube formula around the geography, the industry and the persona that's now being executed at an art form level by our great marketing communications leader and his team. So I'm super impressed with that. We also did something, I think, very interesting with life step that a lot of people haven't picked up on, but life step is a next-generation customer platform. And when you think about having one user experience across the whole enterprise, where people are in and out different screen styles to figure out what they're observing, you also have an observability platform that is a direct-to-consumer platform by design that I think is a precursor to many of the things we can do with the core.  And also, we could take the core and put it in prepackaged, ready-to-run solutions and build an ecosystem around that and turn on a whole new channel of small and mid-market channel partners as we take the company everywhere. And so now, on the big partner channel, there isn't a single one out there in the top 10 that doesn't at least start with a B, meaning we don't have million-dollar conversations, we have billion-dollar conversations, and we even have the top one now chasing $10 billion. So I mean, Kash, in short, we're going to chase every market opportunity all over the world, and we're going to win. And we have a team that's ready to conquer this market like never before. It's so exciting here right now, Kash. I just wish you could be in the building to see it. That's great. But can you feel it, Kash? Can you feel the building? Thank you, Kash. Well, the first thing to recognize here Matt, is huge market opportunities don't require anyone for -- to lose for us to win. They're huge market opportunities. So we'll still integrate, as we already do, with the largest participants in that market. And we want them to be successful because customers have invested in them and our way of going about things is that's great, let's make that customer successful together. That's why they integrate seamlessly into the NOW platform. At the same time, we have many customers that realize that ServiceNow can out-innovate just about anybody in the marketplace, so they want us to do more for them. And clearly, observability was one of those categories. And we just got there a lot faster with light step because we believe Ben and his team are the most innovative in the industry. And we're just so proud to have such trust and partnership with them and such big dreams together. So Lightstep launched incident response, as you said. It's the first new product since joining ServiceNow, and it's big. So incident response will add a lot of context and automation to the incident response process, and customers are looking for that. And by the way, they may even have more than one incident response vendor in there. So we don't rail against others. What we try to do is work for the customer. We've put our part hard hat on, roll up our sleeves and we go to work. Lightstep also launched an industry-first unification of observed billing analytics, and they also get collaborative notebooks. So these innovations are breaking down those silos I referenced between metrics and tracing and streamlining its critical SRE workflow space. So in Q1, for example, we signed some cool deals along with Plaid, which we're very proud of. And that's a data networking company, as you know, and they're powering the Fintech and digital finance product space, and they're using Lightstep for complete visibility into distributed architectures, and they're allowing Plaid to investigate CI and CV issues, and they're doing it 20 times faster than they used to. And we also got Airtable, again, cool brand, next-generation brand, and they're building collaborative applications, and they're driving the reliability of complex distributed systems and proactively improving performance for users, and again, more effectively monitoring and resolving both system-wide and specific customer issues, but they're doing it with one UI, and they're not balancing people in and out of different experiences. And this is what I keep going back to when you talk about real platform innovation and the integrity of a consumer-grade experience, and you can do that across an entire enterprise. That's why I believe our Board of Directors did a great job of defining enterprise software company in the 21st century is doing it with a DESCO 21C logo. So now we have 18,000 people that all they think about is DESCO 21C, whether you're innovating, covering a customer or just driving the conversation. We know where we're going. Thank you very much. Sure. Sure. Well, thank you very much, Alex, for your very kind remarks. It means a lot to us. Our team is doing a really great job. And when they hear that, you just inspire us to go higher, and we appreciate it. So thank you. We've done a lot in terms of the vertical coverage. We have our great Chief Operating Officer, CJ Desai, now not only running all of engineering with what we believe to be the best engineering team in the business, but also, he's overseeing our industry orientation and the whole go-to-market around that. And he teams up in a beautiful way with the go-to-market team, our leader Paul Smith and great regional presence. We have just super proud of our team. But banking is really simplifying the whole middle to back-office operation context, and financial services is going really well. I referenced Barclays, but there's just so many that are all-in on ServiceNow. Our telecommunication solution is really aligning customer care and service assurance, transforming -- just think about how communication service providers deliver great customer experiences. And you can't get away with fixing problems anymore. You've got to proactively anticipate these issues before they even come up. And if they do come up, you've got to address them quickly to maximize availability and quality of service. So we're seeing a lot of traction in telecommunications and we're really becoming the standard across the board. We're super happy with manufacturing and what we're doing there, operations technology management, driving the whole notion of what these manufacturers are trying to do to have their critical technology available and provide visibility and security of all of their assets. Another one I would underscore is health care and life sciences service management. How do you connect cross functional health systems and teams and simplify how people engage with the health care providers, payers, pharma companies and medical device organizations? It's all about the patient experience. And high-tech manufacturing, another one that's really come on strong for us. I mean I could give you more, but those are the ones that are just rocking right now. And one theme I will give you is you can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience unless you first give it to your employees. And the NOW platform is really controlling the conversation now for enlightened decision-makers because they're like, I've got to tether my IT excellence to the employee experience, and I've got to take care of my customers in new and highly innovative ways.  And this platform does the magic they need done, but it does it in days or weeks, not months and months and months and years. And finally, in all these solutions, we're cooperating with those systems of record. The customer knows that they're there and they've got them and they're very important to their business. So we just come in quickly and make everything better for everyone. Thank you very much, Alex. Gregg, it's a great question. Actually, we're so encouraged with our core. Our core is growing beautifully. And if you look at the revenue outcome from our core, it's right there at the corporate rate. So what you're seeing has nothing to do with any dilution in that core business. On the contrary, we've got enormous uplift with our Pro SKU, as you know. That's a 25% uplift. So it's 30% penetrated now. So there's lots of people that like it and there's many more to go. So we have lots of room left on the Pro SKU. If you think about the kind of customers where we're winning, I mean, the great brands, Amerisource Bergen, Baptist Health, Regeneron, DIC pharma -- I mean it goes on and on. Royal Bank of Canada, Telefonica. Every -- Wipro, for example, just like sort of complete generational change with it. So let me make sure I make it clear. The core business has never been stronger. There's no revenue dilution whatsoever. What is happening, we are landing and expanding. And you're right, the IT concept really did form the basis for us to move into the employee experience, the customer experience, the whole creative workflow where citizen developers are now really creating the future they want to see. And without that ever solid magnificent core, none of that would have been possible. So I want to really set the record straight. Our team is doing great across all these segments. The newer or the younger ones are obviously going to get some more land and expand opportunities. But we love on our core, and we love our leaders. Thank you very much, Kirk. I have to tell you, one thing that did surprise me a little bit during the whole virtual environment is CEOs were looking for a good conversation. So we were able to participate in those conversations then, which is obviously helping us now. And we were also able to bring large-scale management team gatherings with our team and their team, so we did good. But now that we're opening up, we should do even better. So I looked at my calendar for the year, I'll catch my family here and there on a weekend because I'm leaving Sunday for Europe, and after that tour of Europe, we'll hitting Asia very, very soon after that. So we're going full speed, open up the company. We're doing these knowledge events in four distinct locations, as I mentioned. Our sellers are going out on the street, and our management and going out on the street because that's where the customers are. And never forget that United Airlines commercial, when a guy walks in, he's got a bunch of envelopes and looks at his management team. We were sitting around the table, gauging it themselves and it goes, let's go visit some customers. So I expect we're going to get a lot of tailwinds out of that because you're right, to build trust with net new logos, it happens in person. It's hard to do that in a digital format. To really expand the relationship to an enterprise scale, it really does require a good meeting of the minds and emotional trust, and we'll do that. So I really think this is going to be another step function improvement in ServiceNow's future because as a platform provider, getting our customers healthy through some of the challenges that they're fighting through is a seminal moment in our history, and I'm excited. Thank you very much. Appreciate. Absolutely. I really appreciate the question. So here's the situation. Our customers need help. The impact part of this equation, think of it much more in the value delivery context than any kind of price increase. It's really accelerating the value realization for the customer against the software that they've already invested in and they want to extract as much business impact as they possibly can.  And for too long, these customer relationships across every company you can think of is managed by a deck at a point of sale, and then ultimately, the sale is made and then the consultants come in. But it's kind of like job changes, people do different things, and a year later, someone's saying, \"Hey, how did we do with that implementation again? Did we get what we bargained for?\" And what we're basically doing is making sure that they do and that there's a professional format in doing that. And not just with ServiceNow, but also for our great partners. So just think of this concept as the NOW platform in ServiceNow is the place where every conversation takes place between the partner, the customer and ServiceNow. There's no e-mails, there's no texts, there's no chat on the side. It's all on one platform with everything detailed and spelled out, and we measure everything in real time with all the analytics and all the business outcomes spilled out in a way that could be presented to any Board of Directors. So also on the pricing, again, I want to be clear, like we're not looking to make up for inflationary pressures by putting it on the customer. There are many new customers. There are many more logos. There are many more expansions to our platform. All we want to make sure of is that we do things highly professional, and we know the ranges where our professional expertise should be valued at.  And in that valuing and in that business impact to the customer, a fair agreement is reached. We even developed a pricing structure that enables customers to partner with us and look at the enterprise value of doing things with ServiceNow, not just 1 departmental value. And I think that whole idea of being a solutions and business impact platform company is resonating big time internally and externally. And incidentally, if you're interested, we've done more than 100 deals right now on ServiceNow Impact. And what we're seeing is user adoption is speeding up, values being accelerated and customer Net Promoter and satisfaction is going through the moon. And as Gina said, the retention rates prove it that it's best in the business. No, it's a really great question, Brad. Thank you very much. As you know, this idea of hyper automation workflows on the NOW platform means a lot to our existing customers. So what they expect from ServiceNow is to remain that highly innovative unicorn that we have been, one that organically builds better, more substantial product experiences with every passing day. And in some cases, they want us to integrate with other tools in the marketplace. But in other cases, if we can build it and it's all integrated into the NOW platform, they would like ServiceNow to own all of that, and we give them choice. And what you see here in this latest release, we brought together process mining, automation, machine learning, RPA and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience. And now customers are going to be quickly innovating and improving the way work flows across the enterprise.  So our job is to be helpful and integrate with all the market participants, especially when customers find that pleasing, but we also need to innovate ourselves and continue to build out this platform story in a way that's super compelling and it's generational. And that's why I said when I first came to ServiceNow, organic is delicious. Thank you. Thank you very much. I look forward to spend some time together, Brad."

            "name": "Gina Mastantuono",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q1 was yet another fantastic quarter of execution. Enterprises are navigating a macro environment filled with a myriad of challenges. Our ability to continue delivering strong results exemplifies the resiliency of our business and the mission-critical nature of the NOW platform. The breadth of our product offering and our geographic reach provide us a diverse array of opportunities for growth. Although FX headwinds grew throughout the quarter, ServiceNow outperformed across all of our Q1 guidance metrics. In fact, net new ACV growth accelerated year-over-year, driving the fastest Q1 growth we've seen since 2018. We expect that momentum will carry into Q2 with net new ACV growth consistent with our very strong second quarter last year. As a result, we're raising the midpoint of 2022 subscription revenue guidance to more than offset these incremental FX headwinds. Turning to Q1 results. Subscription revenues were $1.631 billion, growing 29% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $16 million. This reflects a 300 basis point acceleration in growth year-over-year. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $11.5 billion, representing 31.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $5.69 billion, representing 30.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 1-point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, we saw broad-based strength with energy and utilities, financial services, government, health care, life sciences, TMT, and transportation and logistics all growing net new ACV 40% or more year-over-year. Our renewal rate was best-in-class at 98% in Q1 as the NOW platform remains a core component of our customers' digital transformation efforts. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon as our largest customers continue to expand. We finished the quarter with more than 1,400 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. We closed 52 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in Q1, up 41% year-over-year. This includes seven net new logo deals in the quarter, further demonstrating our success with initiatives to land quality customers. Our portfolio outside of ITSM is also leading more of our largest customer land. Nine out of our top 10 new customer deals were led by non-ICSM products. Turning to profitability. Operating margins surpassed 25%, driven by our revenue beat and certain spend that shifted into Q2. Our free cash flow margin was 45%. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet, including $5.5 billion in cash and investments, putting us in excellent shape to continue investing in strategic initiatives that drive growth. Together, these results demonstrate our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability. And perhaps even more relevant this year is resiliency and predictability of our business model. While a diversity of markets and customers provide stability in our results, the diversity of our employee base continues to make us even stronger. Last week, we released our second annual Global Impact Report. Just as the ServiceNow platform helps us fully integrate customer, employee and technology experiences across our business, we'll continue to use the ServiceNow ESG management and reporting solutions to manage, govern and report our progress. While we're early in our ESG journey, we're extremely proud of our accomplishments in such a short time.  We've made significant improvements in representation and hiring. We've tied executive compensation to both environmental and diversity goals. We fully distributed ServiceNow's $100 million racial equity fund, and we've continued to achieve systemic pay equities. I'm happy with the progress we've made in 2021, but we're just getting started. Moving on to guidance. As the conflict in Ukraine intensified throughout Q1, we continue to see an incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar, resulting in further FX headwinds in 2022. However, on a constant currency basis, the underlying health of our business has remained ever strong. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2022 outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our subscription revenue outlook by $23 million to more than offset the incremental $20 million headwind we're seeing from FX, resulting in a net increase of $3 million. Our new range of $7.025 billion to $7.04 billion represents 26% year-over-year growth. That's 28.5% growth on a constant currency basis, a 50 basis point raise versus our previous outlook. This reflects our updated expectation for constant currency growth to now accelerate year-over-year. We continue to expect subscription gross margins of 86%, up 100 basis points year-over-year, operating margin of 25% and free cash flow margin of 31%. Finally, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 204 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $1.67 billion and $1.675 billion representing 26% year-over-year growth, which is inclusive of a 3-point FX headwind. On a constant currency basis, we expect subscription revenue growth to be 29%, a 250 basis point acceleration from Q2 2021. We expect CRPO growth of 25% year-over-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. I'd note that for full year 2022, we have a larger-than-average customer cohort that renews in Q4. We will see between one and two points of increasing headwinds to Q2 and Q3 CRPO growth as those contractual obligations wind down. When the cohort renews, though, in Q4, those headwinds will subside, and we expect CRPO growth to reaccelerate quarter-over-quarter. We expect an operating margin of 22%, which reflects the timing of marketing spend that shifted from Q1 into Q2 and some incremental FX. We expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, Q1 was another outstanding quarter. Our momentum is setting us up for a great year. As Bill highlighted, we're excited about our San Diego release. Our future innovation pipeline is robust, as we seek to extend our market leadership, deepening our competitive moat as the platform for digital business. ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  I'd like to invite you all to hear more about the momentum we're seeing and learn more about our new products and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 24 in Las Vegas. Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication.  And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Thank you, Karl. That's exactly right. And so basically, what we're saying is that there's a 1- to 2-point impact in Q2 and Q3 because of this new -- this large renewal cohort. And so if you think about a renewal and a customer that at the end of Q4 2021 had $1 million. And that's up for renewal in Q4 in 2022, in Q4 of last year, the RPO would have had $1 million, then in Q1, it would have had $750,000. Then in Q2, it would have had $500 million; Q3, $250,000. So that's the impact that we're talking about. And we've quantified it for you at between 1% to 2%, and you've got it exactly right how you're talking about it with the math. Yes. And I would just add, Phil, that you're seeing the numbers, Q1 headcount up 28% year-over-year in this environment is pretty phenomenal, and hats off to our HR function and recruiting function and all of the teams for being able to do that. But you're seeing it right. We continue to invest in sales and marketing and R&D. It's really about driving innovation and sales and marketing, really getting that strong go-to market, that we have been talking about. We talked about for the full year expecting hiring in the high 20s, and we're absolutely on that trajectory to continue that. With respect to productivity with the sales folks, we're definitely seeing good productivity increases year-over-year in Q1 and expect to see that continue throughout the year. So go-to-market teams are executing very well. We feel really good about the results. And on that note, Kash, I hope to see you on May 24 at Investor Day because we'll talk a lot about what we look like at $10 billion and $15 billion-plus. So hope to see you there. So we -- I talked about in my prepared remarks that we expect Q2 to show accelerating net new ACV growth as well, consistent. Whether that lasts for the full year, they're pretty incredible comps. And so we obviously don't guide to full year net new ACV, Alex. But the reason I spoke about it specifically was really because I wanted everyone to feel confident that the CRPO guide, although slightly less than Q1, really had this impact, right? And that it wasn't driving -- it wasn't a result of the underlying business that, in fact, we're seeing accelerating net new ACV in Q1 and expect similar in Q2. So that was the reason for my comment. I'm so proud of our entire organization for being able to drive an acceleration of this scale at our scale. And just really excited about the momentum we're seeing into Q2. We feel really strong and good about the guide for the full year. And the momentum that we're seeing in Q1, we expect to be consistent throughout the year. Thanks, Brad."

ServiceNow closed an outstanding 2023 with a beyond expectations Q4. Here's the state of our business. Artificial intelligence is injecting new fuel into our already high-performing growth engine. The company's Q4 results tell that story. Subscription revenue grew by 25.5% at constant currency, that's 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. cRPO growth is 23% at constant currency, also 200 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 29%, that's approximately 200 basis points above our guidance. We had 168 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, up from 126 a year ago, a 33% increase. ServiceNow's Q4 performance is packed with milestones spanning the full breadth of our portfolio. With technology, customer, and creator, we now have three workflow businesses over $1 billion in ACV. We have 11 individual product lines with north of $250 million in ACV. ITSM, ITOM, and ITAM, each had double-digit deals over $1 million in Q4. Security and risk combined for 12 of the top 20 with nine deals over $1 million. Customer, Employee, and Creator workflows, each had double-digit deals over $1 million. Our large new logo count continued to accelerate in Q4. We had a record 10 new customers signing deals over $1 million in NNACV, including a $10 million win with a very large global financial services firm, which is our largest new customer logo in history. Global iconic brands such as Chipotle, Air France, TIAA, NTT, Data Group Corporation, and Busch are digitally transforming with ServiceNow. We are proud that TIAA, one of our first 10 customers, is still expanding their business with us through new out-of-the-box functionality so they can accelerate time-to-market. Following a record Q3, public sector continued its strong growth in Q4 with key wins including in the United States Army, US Postal Service, and Australian Department of Defense Digital Delivery Group. We are extremely proud to have finished 2023 operating at the rule of 55 plus. As you'll hear from Gina, our 2024 guidance reflects our ongoing belief and ServiceNow's strategic relevance. Our core business is rock solid and growing. Our perimeter is growing. Our platform adoption is growing. We are, in fact, in a new era of business transformation powered by AI. This is unlocking massive opportunity in the enterprise software industry. And ServiceNow is extremely well-positioned, not only to lead this movement, but to define it. 2023 was the latest successful milestone on this journey and we intend to make 2024 an even greater success. To say we're fired up would be an understatement. Let's spend some time framing the dimensions of this new AI world. Gartner estimates $5 trillion in tech spending in 2024, growing to $6.5 trillion by 2027. That means that spending will grow another $1 trillion in only two years, accelerating from the decade plus it took for us to get to $5 trillion. For the first time in a decade, IT services will become bigger than communication services in 2024. Gartner estimates that by 2027, nearly all of the growth in worldwide IT spending will come from software and IT services. And when you drill deeper into the Gartner forecast between 2023 and 2027, $3 trillion will be spent on AI. What we have here is a strong, durable market being supercharged by a once-in-a-generation secular trend. ServiceNow has been investing, innovating and preparing for this wave for years, which is why we're catching it so early. We have a long track record of commercializing breakthrough technologies. When our Pro SKUs were introduced, we saw very exciting traction and customer adoption. Our Pro Plus offerings, which we launched just four months ago with our Vancouver release, are outperforming the pace of the Pro upgrade cycle. Exciting. The results in our first full quarter since launch validate this trajectory. Siemens AG is using Now Assist for HR service delivery to resolve HR cases faster for its entire global workforce. This is one example of many and as always, ServiceNow's strength and our capacity to deploy net new innovation, especially our ambitious Gen AI road map. In Q4, we released significant new capabilities, Virtual Agent Update drives faster issue resolution through advanced conversational AI chat. Employees get the immediate answers they need. Businesses get higher self-solve rates, and it only takes 15 minutes to set it up. Our text to workflow capability dramatically increases developer productivity. ServiceNow's developers have been using text to code for several months. They are generating high-quality code using text to describe the type of code they want. This has increased our developer innovation speed by 52%. Now Assist for field service management reduces cost, while increasing revenue by helping technicians get the job done in the first visit; identifying the necessary equipment, providing repair recommendations, and automating follow-up at speed. Beyond the platform itself, we see AI as a 360-degree strategic imperative. It's why ServiceNow joined the AI Alliance to advance open, safe, and responsible AI. It's also why we are continuing to grow our strategic partnerships to ensure every enterprise can use AI as the cornerstone of business transformation. Today, we expanded our strategic alliance with EY to co-create solutions for generative AI governance for our customers. And of course, EY will also be using ServiceNow's generative AI capabilities to enhance experiences for all of their employees. We also unveiled another major expansion to our partner program, the latest addition in a series of investments as partners are building new business models on the ServiceNow platform. These are two examples of many. I've told ServiceNow's team worldwide that the company is now moving into Phase 5. The culmination of our long-term goal of surpassing $10 billion in ACV, which incidentally only a handful of software companies have ever achieved. We have so much runway ahead for the long-term growth of this company. There are two key elements of our strategy, execution and scale. Execution, we know is an art form. Scale is all about capitalizing on new opportunities as a truly global platform company. One of those in our market making alliance was Visa. Today, ServiceNow and Visa announced a five-year strategic alliance to transform payment service experiences. In the initial phase of the alliance, the companies will launch ServiceNow Disputes Management built with Visa, a single connected solution for dispute resolution. This Gen AI-powered solution will offer end-to-end dispute resolution for customers globally, everything from the first indication of a questionable charge through early investigation to final resolution. Another example is our growing partnership with AWS. Beginning this month, ServiceNow will be available as a SaaS offering in the AWS marketplace. From an automation perspective, we have long believed that identifying legacy process challenges is an active stimulant for new workflows. That's the beauty of our platform. The architecture gives us limitless ways to accelerate speed to value for our customers. And the more workflows we drive, the more value we create. That's why we tucked in UltimateSuite, a task mining company to enhance intelligent automation across the Now platform. If we can help customers find it, ServiceNow can fix it. And we fix it in complete harmony with any existing software landscape, delivered in a consumer-grade user experience. CEOs don't want to wait another decade for technology to finally deliver on its promise. One told me, I'm tired of excuses coming into my boardroom. We need new innovation and new experiences, and we need it now. That's obviously music to our ears and nicely on brand for ServiceNow. There's plenty more to discuss about the company we are building and the progress we're making. We have more accolades than time to listen to them. Top analyst firms ranked ServiceNow as a leader in 14 separate reports in 2023 for our automation and AI capabilities. Glassdoor's recent US Best Places to Work lists ServiceNow as Number Three overall and Number One in software. One of our proudest achievements is the American Opportunity Index. This index is databased. They study what really happens to employees at America's largest companies over time. ServiceNow scored Fifth, and that's out of 400 companies overall and ServiceNow was the Number One technology company on the index. That means that people who have fought hard to build a great company are being rewarded with a great life. This all means so much to us because culture is the glue that binds a winning team together. We have world-class professionals at ServiceNow who care deeply about our customers and our partners. Since Fred Luddy invented the company, we've all made our contributions to help ServiceNow emerge as the hungry and humble winner it is. We believe in our platform. We stick together and we try to have some fun along the way too. That's why the results show up the way they do. It's also why over 1 million people applied to work here last year. To all of our shareholders who continue to invest your trust and ServiceNow, we thank you, and we've got you back. We're building a masterpiece here, and we're only getting started. 2024 will show that we're putting AI to work for the world because now, as ever, the world works with ServiceNow. I look forward to the questions and the discussion we'll have shortly. In the meantime, I'd like to turn the call over to our outstanding Chief Financial Officer, Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Happy New Year to all of you who are listening in. Q4 was another exceptional quarter to conclude what has been a phenomenal year. Once again, we exceeded our topline growth and operating margin guidance metrics, showcasing our team's relentless focus on execution. ServiceNow's agility in responding to enterprise needs has solidified our position as the trusted intelligent platform for driving digital transformation. In Q4, subscription revenues were $2.365 billion, growing 25.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. We closed out 2023 with $8.68 billion in subscription revenues, also representing 25.5% constant currency growth. All organic at a scale that hasn't been accomplished by any other enterprise software company. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion representing an acceleration to 27.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. cRPO was $8.6 billion, representing 23% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 200 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities, business and consumer services, and education were particularly robust in the quarter. Government control continued to show impressive growth and Telecom, Media, and Technology also saw strength. As Bill noted, I'm pleased to announce that customer workflows crossed $1 billion in ACV in Q4 fast following our Creator Workflows, which hit that momentous milestone in just Q3. We now have three workflow categories generating over $1 billion in ACV, highlighting the breadth of our portfolio. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 99% in Q4, continuing to demonstrate the strategic relevance of the Now platform as it remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We ended the year with over 8,100 customers with our focus on landing the right new customers continuing to bear fruit as large new logo growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. We ended Q4 with 1,897 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. We closed 168 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year, that includes five deals over $10 million. And for the full year 2023, we saw an approximate 30% increase in deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. In Q4, our Gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution for our first full quarter of any of our new product family releases ever, including our original Pro SKU. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin exceeded 29%, approximately 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by the topline outperformance and disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 55%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. For the full year 2023 operating margin was 28% and free cash flow margin was 30%. Total free cash flow for 2023 was a robust $2.7 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $8.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q4, we repurchased 400,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have $962 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability, and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. We are raising our 2024 outlook to reflect the strong momentum with which we exited 2023. This partially reflects the early success we've seen with our Gen AI products as those investments are accelerating the build of our already robust pipeline with customers lining up to be first movers in this next wave of business transformation. As always, we continue to be prudent around our assumptions for incremental customer budgets and the macro cost in our guidance. With that in mind, let's turn to 2024 guidance. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $165 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.555 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, reflecting investments in our data centers and emerging growth opportunities, offset by 100 basis point benefit from a change in useful life of our data center equipment from four to five years resulting from an assessment completed earlier this month. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 28% to 29%, driven by continued OpEx efficiencies. We expect free cash flow margin of 31%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, overcoming an incremental point of cash tax headwinds. Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 208 million. For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $2.510 billion and $2.515 billion, representing 24% to 24.5% year-over-year growth or 23.5% to 24% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects the tremendous strength of our federal business, which has resulted in a higher mix of 12-month contracts that will create a negative 150 basis point impact to Q1 cRPO growth. We expect that these contracts will renew in Q3 as ServiceNow's federal contract renewal rates are 99%. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect 208 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, ServiceNow's Q4 outperformance is another example of the strength of our platform and our people. This team's amazing accomplishments in 2023 set the stage for continued success in 2024. ServiceNow is positioned as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation, has gained momentum throughout the year, leaders are shifting their investments into proven strategic platforms that leverage the power of AI to deliver growth across the top and bottom lines, with customers prioritizing quick time to value the Now Platform delivers. The accelerating pace of investment in workflow automation and interest in Gen AI positions us well on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill, CJ, and I would like to extend our gratitude to all our employees worldwide for their outstanding contributions to ServiceNow's success this past year. 2023 was a remarkable year, and we look forward to an even more exciting 2024. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad, your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much and congrats on an amazing finish to 2023. Bill, it's clear that Now platform is a destination of choice for enterprise AI and modern digital workflows. But I'd love to hear your view of the environment versus what you see is Now specific. It would be great if maybe you can share a bit about close rates, sales rep participation rates or even the net new ACV performance as you did last year, just to help us contextualize how it's going out there. Thanks.\nBill McDermott: Yes, Brad, thank you very much for the question. Things are going very well out there, and the momentum is terrific. What's really happening and I can say this after 186 CEO meetings in the last six months, the CEOs are now getting very involved with the Gen AI revolution. They realize there has to be architectural adjustments to their environment and the manner in which they manage their data and the platforms they're beholden to actually take advantage of Gen AI. And if you think about the half a century mess that exists out there with legacy systems, in many cases, multiples of the same system, we have one unifying force in these conversations, which is the Now platform because we cooperate with the complexity of this landscape without putting people in a position to rip and replace. So, they're looking for platforms that matter. We're one of those and I think as Gina said, we are the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. When you have that C-level executive meeting, they really get it now and with regard to Gen AI, the momentum is outstanding. As I said, that SKU has outsold any other new introduction we put into the marketplace. So, there's a real appetite to invest in Gen AI, and there's no price sensitivity around it because the business cases are so unbelievable. I mean if you're improving productivity, 40%, 50%, it just sells itself. So, I think we're in a really, really good place. The Gen AI investments are coming. We're actually getting orders because we have great product, thanks to CJ and his unbelievable engineering team. So, I would tell you at this time last year, compared to this time this year, you should be more bullish now.\nBrad Zelnick: Yes. And it's great to see it reflected in the guidance. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, the floor is yours.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. So, Bill, I don't think I've heard any other software companies say that its Gen AI products produced the strongest net new ACV of any product family. We had a contact saying it's really the only platform with real-life uses of AI right now. So, I'm wondering if you think that is accurate, and that's what's driving it or should we relate it more to the work you've done getting ahead on pricing and packaging? Should we think back to the efforts of that element AI team, which is so fantastic or maybe it's some other factor in your mind that's really allowing you to see faster adoption of AI?\nBill McDermott: Yes, I mean, I'll obviously let CJ comment on this also. But you look at the Visa strategic partnership using Gen AI solution to manage end-to-end dispute resolutions with customers. I mean this is one of the great brands in the world, one of the substantial companies. And just think about the impact Gen AI has in a radically simplifying their conversation with their customer and deflecting all the human capital it takes to resolve these cases when technology can do it. If you look at EY and the idea of instilling Gen AI governance on a single pane of glass to manage risk and compliance for some of the biggest corporations in the world. If you look at the opportunity, every single industry has a great opportunity. I was in Germany recently, and I was talking to a home appliance industry participant. Post-COVID, they went from 25% online sales to much more than 50%, and it's growing. So, when CJ and his team brought Field Service Management with Gen AI to the marketplace, just think about one call where the agent instead of -- the rep instead of using a clipboard and a pencil, he's got it on the mobile, knows exactly what part to bring, resolves the case on the spot. That's one part of it, but here is another part of it. The consumer will pay a lot more if they can get a same-day repairs agreement along with the appliance. And the margins on same-day repair are far greater than the box itself, plus you create a nice annuity stream. So, what we're talking about here is fundamentally rethinking the way business is transformed using our platform and Gen AI. And CJ, I know, and I do want to congratulate you and thank you for the job that you continue to do, bringing this innovation to the marketplace. Please give us your thoughts.\nCJ Desai: Thank you, Bill. And Mark, here is how I would say some of the questions that you asked are absolutely spot on. Element AI team was absolutely a game changer from talent perspective. And our investments in AI, that you're very familiar with since 2017, continue for us, not only on the speed of innovation, but what we learned from our customers. Let me give you a couple of quick insights. We were the first ones -- one of the first ones to release the product with use case specific generative AI starting in September. So we definitely had first mover's advantage from that perspective. However, from a customer sentiment perspective, I will tell you there were two Wall Street banks telling me specifically that they wanted to be the first ones on the Street, Wall Street in New York, to go with our Gen AI solution and one of them signed with us. And you work for one, but in the sense that this is a highly regulated environment, regulators want to know how AI is done, and we were able to sign with the first Wall Street Bank in New York in Q4. In addition, we also signed with a large manufacturing company that wants to fundamentally transform their employee productivity. And then we also signed with a very large restaurant food retailer who wanted to transform employee experience and overall shared services productivity so that their margins can go up. This is definitely a game changer. We are learning a lot from our customers. We are seeing very significant momentum and I was here when we launched 2018 September, ITSM Pro, and as Bill and Gina shared that this has exceeded all of our expectations on how well we did on the monetization of our Pro Plus SKUS. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. Congrats on being so far ahead.\nBill McDermott: Thanks a lot Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair. Your line is open.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you guys so much and I'll add my congrats. I wanted to maybe touch on the strength that you're seeing in customer and employee workflows because if I look at the net new ACV that you're driving there, the mix is relatively stronger than IT workflows there this quarter. Is that attributed to some of this AI adoption and plus SKU? Or are there other drivers there that you're seeing driving momentum in those solutions?\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Arjun, and I really appreciate it. Just a couple of statistics on the customer workflows, 18 of our top 20 deals, what we're seeing is there's a tremendous opportunity to really take ServiceNow and squarely place it on the Customer Relationship Management category. When you think about front, mid and back office and the fact that we can align all three of those things, and nobody has to lose for us to win. We could fill in all the blanks for what the current participants don't do, especially with their integration problems. It's just a fantastic opportunity for our customers. And I think it's important to note, when I gave the Field Service Management example, our net new ACV in Field Service Management, specifically was up over 50% and year-over-year. So, I think it's important to recognize that we have a whole list of new logos in this space. And employee workflows, nine of our top 20 deals and was kind of interesting. Every single CEO now is looking to make the people packed far more productive than it is and with natural language to have your employees seek the data and the information they want and have it reported back to them in just a very nice paragraph of content and data so they can do their jobs better, is kind of like in the no-brainer category. And we have some really great logos that I'm sure CJ would like to share with you as well. But both of those areas are really good. And incidentally, that employee spot that I mentioned was up 80% year-over-year.\nCJ Desai: Thank you, Bill. And Arjun, some of the questions that you asked, you're spot on. So, AI and specifically Pro Plus SKU was a catalyst, both for our employee and customer workflow. So, that's number one. Number two, within customer workflow, which had an amazing quarter, and I'm so proud of that team and ServiceNow to cross $1 billion which just a few years ago was $10 million. That's a multiple orders of magnitude growth on the difference we are making in customer service because we are ServiceNow, and we know how to do customer service. So, ServiceNow growth was unbelievable from customer service and customer workflow perspective. Two sectors, I'll call out besides Bill's point on Field Service Management. Number one, our telco products, specifically designed for telco industry, saw triple-digit growth with some of the largest telcos in the world related to customer service. And also, we saw in public sector from a direct to citizen perspective, Customer Service Management Did really well in Q4. And on employee workflow, as Gina outlined, we had many million-dollar deals across the industries, including public sector and that business, in addition to HR service delivery with workplace service delivery and legal service delivery, continues to do very well, growing very strongly.\nArjun Bhatia: Great to hear. Thank you, CJ, thank you, Bill. Congrats again.\nCJ Desai: Thank you so much Arjun.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open Kash.\nKash Rangan: Congratulations, Bill, Gina, CJ. Great to hear that you're among the first sort of software companies to give us splendid results and we feel better about 2024 already just based on your numbers. Bill, a question for you. It looks like generative AI making sales cycles easier, if I could say that, and has the potential to bring in repeat business with existing customers at a faster pace and magnitude. Can you talk a little bit about how much easier it has gotten despite the environment staying tough, but for generative AI, how much easier has it gotten for the company to generate that initial lead and close that deal and do more repeat business? That's it for me. Thank you.\nCJ Desai: Hey Kash. So, I will touch on this from a couple of things. demand environment, as Gina has outlined, it continues to be still tough, right? We are not ready to say that things have improved significantly. It is our platform's strategic relevance, as Gina called out, is very high, which has allowed us to what you saw million-dollar deals and large deals that happened in our Q4 across the globe, across the industries, the performance was very strong. So, let me just touch on that. On generative AI the demand for generative AI varies by industry, but we are -- I'll give you an example of a large manufacturing company, the CIO reached out to me in October, wanted to do a four weeks POC and purchase it in December. So, from a sales cycle perspective, that was a top-down decision moving very, very fast. A large retailer is currently also doing a proof of concept with ServiceNow Pro Plus SKU because it is a CEO initiative that Bill talked about. So, from a demand on Gen AI specifically, it is very, very clear that customers are pulling us in that direction in certain industries. And for those sales cycles, yes, they are very fast. They want to see a large manufacturing company CEO that Bill met in Germany, I had a follow-up call in December, and he said, CJ, I want to kick off on Pro Plus SKU for the specific use cases on ITSM. And you and I should review the results end of February. This is faster than ITSM Pro sales cycle. And so I would say overall environment is still similar from what we saw in Q3 to Q4, and Gina will touch on it, but Gen AI, it's on a faster cycle.\nBill McDermott: Yes. May I also just add one thing, Kash. If you think about every single industry, they all have their own personality. So, for example, I had the opportunity to meet a pharma company. And as you know, the average life cycle, for example, for clinical trials is over six and a half years. And this is an industry that drops $200 billion a year on this clinical trial process and 90% of them fail. So, if you just think about that for a minute, you say, well, what can generative AI do to automate document generation, for example, that would be in line with regulatory protocols and you come up with site contracting agreements, for example, that also include the patient, because the patient has to be engaged in the process, otherwise, they won't stay in the trial. And every time a patient opts out, they lose money, $20,000 per patient. So, generative AI on the ServiceNow platform obviously can go in there and radically cut down the cycle-time of these clinical trials. So, CEOs right out of the gates are ready to go. Your team, my team, let's figure this out. So, there's a real appetite. And I think why I'm so bullish is we have a platform that already has it.\nKash Rangan: Amazing. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith, the floor is yours.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys and again, congratulations on really strong end to 2023. I wanted to talk a little bit on the expense side of the equation. You guys really outperformed nicely on the operating margin side of the equation this quarter looking for further expansion next year. And looking at sort of where you guys are hiring, I was a little bit surprised to see more strength on the R&D side of the equation than sales and marketing. Sales and marketing headcount is only up 6%. So, you talk to us about sort of that relationship changing a little bit. R&D headcount is almost matching sales and marketing head count right now. If we went back five years ago, sales and marketing was 50% ahead of R&D. So how are the investment priorities changing now, especially as we go to 2024? And how are you guys feeling about sales capacity and sort of the necessity to expand sales capacity heading into 2024?\nGina Mastantuono: Hi Keith, this is Gina. Thanks so much for the question. So, yes, we're really proud of the beat on the topline as well as the bottom-line in Q4 and obviously continuing to expand those margins in 2024. Specifically, when you think about investments in R&D head count, it's all around continued innovation and our investments in Gen AI and AI. And so not surprising given the commentary that you've already heard, we're continuing to double down in investments on fingers on keyboards, engineers really driving the Gen AI revolution. So, you'll continue to see more of that. On the sales side, it's really about scale and leverage, right? And so sales and marketing head count, there's a lot in there. It's not just quota-bearing feet on the street sales, right? So, you've got marketing, you've got marketing operations, you have sales operations in there. If you actually were able to break it down to feet-on-the-street quota-bearing sales, you would see that growth rate much higher. And in fact, as I think about sales capacity going into 2024, we have a larger increase in ramped reps going into 2024 than we've had in years. So, from a capacity perspective, we feel great about how we're entering 2024.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent.\nGina Mastantuono: Awesome. Thanks for the question Keith.\nKeith Weiss: It seems like it really speaks to an increasing sales efficiency then. You just need less people to support any given quota-bearing sales reps.\nGina Mastantuono: Absolutely. Productivity and efficiency is going up as well as the fact that from a scale perspective, you're not growing some of the operational heads as much.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you guys.\nGina Mastantuono: And we'll be definitely increasing hiring as we go into 2024 as you would expect.\nBill McDermott: And Keith, Gina doesn't brag about this, neither does Russ Elmer, who is our Office of General Counsel lead. We're using the Now platform. So, in all the back office functions of the company, we're so automated, so productive. And they're getting things done on the Now platform that it would take other companies five and six times the headcount to do the same job. And that is really something. We actually even had with legal service delivery, AI tell us that we're spending too much time on contracts less than $250,000. Our office of General Counsel, Russ made the decision based on AI that we could fundamentally change that and reorient the workflow around those kinds of agreements, which gave us a huge rush, and he didn't have to hire anybody. And then he actually took that product and our great engineering team built it. We call it LSD, Legal Service Delivery and now lawyers all over the world, they want to jump on. So, everything we do internally with Now on Now as an external marketing force associated with it.\nCJ Desai: Yes. And Keith, Gina handled this really well in terms of sales efficiency. But one of the things that Bill mentioned that I just wanted to call out that we are really proud of our sales teams besides expansion of our platform in different buying centers, but also the new logo growth. The new logo growth for 2023 was way ahead of what our expectations were specifically in Americas and Europe compared to 2022, including the large transaction that Bill referenced. But when your sales capacity and sales efficiency specifically is improving, while you're also gaining new logos, which is just a very super proud moment for us in 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad, your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, thanks. Congrats on a great close to 2023. Gina, I was wondering if maybe you could help us understand that on the cRPO upside, if you think about the 200 basis points and could you kind of break down for us how much of it was adoption of Gen AI and the net new ACV that, that drove exceeding expectations versus just kind of more strength than expected on the renewal cohort and what drove -- what's the mechanic of the upside was in the quarter?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, sure. So, we beat our Q4 cRPO growth guidance by 200 basis points as you know. And I would say it's driven probably half and half by net new ACV outperformance and certainly, Gen AI is in there, but it's not all Gen AI. So, our core business is also doing well. And then we also did see higher early renewals than we had assumed in our guidance. And I would say it's about half and half of the total beat.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then, Bill, this is maybe for you or for CJ. But as you think about the product portfolio and some of the newer products you've talked about over the last year or so beyond Gen AI's observability or ERP workflows, where are you seeing the most demand or interest outside of Gen AI? And what are you most optimistic about in 2024 beyond Gen AI?\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. So, Samad, here is what I would say. In general, every single workflow grew for us on net new ACV, which is always a great thing that, that's a balanced performance across every single workflow. And so really proud of the team, both our go-to-market and engineering teams that we continue to deliver innovations and our go-to-market teams, they know how to sell that innovation across our product lines. So, that's number one. Number two, when I look at some of our industry products that I called out, specifically for TMT as in telco, media and tech, they are seeing very nice traction. We also released in our technology workflow under the leadership of Pablo Stern, operational technology product that also grew very nicely. Bill called out Field Service Management, Customer Service Management had an amazing not only Q4 but 2023, and then employee workflow also grew. So, as I'm walking through this list besides Gen AI and then I can tell you the same thing about security, risk, and so our asset management had a phenomenal 2023. So, I expect all these product lines to continue to have momentum besides generative AI.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Alex, the floor is yours.\nAlex Zukin: Thanks guys. So, first of all, congratulations on a fantastic quarter. And I think the amount of conversation about Gen AI and the tangible impacts of it on the model and the quarter were really great to hear about and see. I just -- I wanted to dig in a little bit to see if you could dimensionalize further either from a revenue contribution kind of cRPO or bookings contribution in the quarter or attach rate that you're seeing with Pro Plus as you go to market? And how should we think about that for fiscal 2024? What's the aspiration here for Q1? Just give us a better -- I'd say, a better indicator or something that we can kind of monitor and track where we can see the Gen AI penetration going forward? And I have a quick follow-up.\nGina Mastantuono: Sure, Alex, it's Gina. What I'd say is and we called this out in my script, right? At the end of the day, Gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution in the first full quarter of any of our new product family releases ever, including original Pro SKU. So, I get the question often, do we the adoption curve to be steeper for our Pro Plus than our Pro. Certainly, in the first full quarter of launch, it absolutely has shown that. That being said, it's very early days. And so from a revenue contribution perspective, it's not going to be huge, but it's certainly helped when I thought about my guide for 2024 and that increase of $165 million at the midpoint, right? So Gen AI, early days, but the adoption curve so far is steeper than the original Pro. We will keep an eye on it. And as the numbers get larger, we will continue to update you and everyone else as to the penetration. But right now, excitement and interest from our customer base is much stronger than we ever saw in the first -- in early days of our Pro SKU, and we're excited by that momentum at the same time being conservative as I think about the guidance for 2024 because it's still so early.\nAlex Zukin: Super helpful. And then I guess, if I think about just the opportunity around or actually just cRPO linearity throughout the year, you talked about the headwinds in the first half. How does that trend through the second half of the year? And then what other things should we be paying attention to there?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So, we called out the 150 basis point impact in Q1 that increases to about 200 basis points in Q2, so we expect similar levels from Q1 to Q2. I'm not going to guide out any further than that at this point. But what I'll tell you is that I increased the full year 2024 guide by $165 million. We remain as confident as ever in our guide of $15 billion plus in 2026. And Gen AI and the innovation in our -- all of our product portfolio is going to help drive that growth.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys. Congrats again.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Alex.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham & Co. Your line is open Mike.\nMike Cikos: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question here and I'll echo my sentiment as well along with my peers. I just wanted to come back, I think earlier during the Q&A, CJ had kind of teased and maybe the monetization here for the Plus SKUs relative to the Pro SKU exceeding your expectations. And just wanted to make sure I was interpreting that properly. Can you give us any indication for what that price capture is like relative the Pro SKUs which we've had out in the market now for a couple of years?\nCJ Desai: Yes. So, Mike, first of all, the Pro SKUs, as you know, that we launched it in 2018 Q3, so we have five years of consistent trajectory and measures on how we did on Pro across ITSM, CSM and so on. And that we shared at Financial Analyst Day in May. Gina shared that number that we got 25% uplift. When I look at Pro Plus, first, just to underscore what Gina said that it definitely exceeded our expectation, did really, really well and the fastest growth. We have launched so many products over so many years. This definitely exceeded our expectations. So, that's number one. Number two, just simple thing. When I'm looking at what, based on the volume discounts, customers leaning in, asking us to try out from POC, POE perspective, it is in line with what my expectations were on how we would get the price uplift. So, right now, as Bill said, I did not get any, Oh my God, CJ, this is not going to work for us, where is the value. We have to always earn our right and deliver the value for our customers. But right now, it is in line with my expectations.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. Thank you very much guys.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Mike.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl with UBS. Karl, the floor is yours.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Maybe I'll direct this to Bill and CJ. You both mentioned ServiceNow's largest ever new customer win with the bank. I guess I'm surprised that there's big bank out there that's not already on ServiceNow, but I'd love to hear a little bit more about that, and I'm not even sure how big a deal would have to be to be your largest new win? So, any size and color would be fabulous.\nBill McDermott: Yes, I think we were -- I think, Mike, you called it. I think we were at 23 out of 24 of the world's largest and most significant ones. And now we're at 24 out of 24. And I just seriously want to credit the amazing platform of ServiceNow, the MRA process and integrated risk management and the complexity of going into an environment like that is pretty serious stuff. And to have a marquee brand trust us and believe in us and believe in ServiceNow the way they did is really inspiring. And I really have to turn it over to CJ and give him so much credit for the hard work that he put into it. And I know firsthand because I had the front row seat to watching it and how we spent time with this wonderful customer. And CJ, I'm sure you got some color that you might want to put on that.\nCJ Desai: Yes. Karl, great to hear from you. I would say fundamentally, when I look at that particular financial services institution, 100% is true that it is on our core of the core. So, from an IT service management perspective, IT operations management perspective, this is not generative AI-specific deal, but it was very much a very strategic transaction on the foundational platform for automation and digital services at this large financial services institution. It is the largest new logo win that we had there, and it is in eight-figures of net new ACV. So, that is material.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Congrats on that.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very Karl. Appreciate it.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Karl.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Joel, the floor is yours.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you for taking the question. I will also echo the outstanding execution you guys have done. Bill, I guess this is for you. Just around the public sector vertical, it's been very strong for you for several quarters. I guess two things. Number one is, how is the spending remain subsistent, it used to be very cyclical there? And the second question around public sector is, what do you think their AI adoption cadence is going to look like from your perspective?\nBill McDermott: Yes. Well, thank you very much for the question. I really appreciate it. Our federal business is really outstanding. And for the benefit of our shareholders, I think that there's a tremendous opportunity to replicate what we're doing in the United States federal and many other governments around the world. That is clearly an ambition that we have, and we have many use cases and many references to back that up. So, CJ, I think you spent a lot of time with our team. And I know that I mentioned some of the names like United States Army, United States Postal Service as an example, really marquee wins, really, really important stuff. Why don't you build on that?\nCJ Desai: Yes. So, Joel, everything that we have seen, as you saw in 2023, consistent performance in our what we call global public sector. So, let me start there. US Federal, we highlighted the strength in Q3, followed by some of the logos that Bill discussed. However, I do want to state that we are also doing really well. Our platform is for state and local governments in the United States and that growth was also very inspiring in 2023. So not only US Federal, but also US state and local. Now, let me take an example for Q4. Besides United States, we also did really well in public sector in United Kingdom. On Bill's ask and our customers' ask, I spent some time in London with our public sector customers, and they continue to also leverage ServiceNow for similar use cases that we have seen in the US Federal. And then in Q4, our Australia public sector team also did really well, and we had significant platform expansion with some of the large central governments their agencies, including generative AI. So, it is a pretty good picture. And we see in 2024, besides these nations. When I look at Canada, when I look at Germany and many others, the opportunity remains large, as Bill called it out.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. And just as the follow-up on the public sector adopting AI. Can you just give us a little color on what you think the trajectory is there?\nCJ Desai: The trajectory, so I just want to make sure that you understand, first is that our Gen AI conversations have started with the government. One of our first logos in Q3 was with a large public sector agency, as I call it. We also had a few wins in Q4 in public sector. And as we go into 2024, across state, local and federal, across countries, we will continue to see the demand. It's early days. I would say, compared to like a financial services or manufacturing and others. But given our position of our platform and the strength we have with AI, we are definitely going to see in the second half adoption of generative AI.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. Thank you so much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Weed from AllianceBernstein. Peter, the floor is yours.\nPeter Weed: Thank you and congratulations on the major continued momentum and wins that you are seeing with the latest releases. And I guess building on that, I'd say, prior to this year, for several years, I think there have been some really nice stability in kind of expansion in NRR or customers that I think Gina had and really comforted. But I think this year, there has been some deceleration in that driven by macro. As you look out to 2024, do you see signals that we may be able to see some acceleration where NRR in 2024 might exceed what they kind of dipped to this year or is this kind of like the new normal and kind of from here, things may continue to trend down?\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Peter for the question. What I'd say is that we are -- we feel great about our expansion rates at the scale that we're at as well as on new logo growth. So, CJ mentioned earlier, our new logo growth, especially in our larger customers, has been an accelerating each and every year and each and every quarter over the last several years. And so at our scale, our expansion rates remain extremely strong, and as does our net new logo growth. And so you will continue to see a nice mix of existing customers upselling with us as well as new logos joining us. And so we hit $8.7 billion in revenue going to $10.575 billion next year. At our scale, these expansion rates are best-in-class, and we remain extremely proud of them.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. And that question will come from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Brad, the floor is yours.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the large new logo strength. We just haven't heard from a lot of enterprise applications companies around that this year. It seems like a tough environment to close big transformational new application deals. So, I wanted to ask why now? I know this has been a focus, but any color on where you're at in kind of closing that gap on some of these large global organizations? And then also, what does that mean for your expansion opportunity, does this give you more line of sight to that given that these are large organizations with big wallets just getting started with ServiceNow? Thank you.\nCJ Desai: Yes. So, Brad, I will touch on it. Besides financial services institution, we also saw many large new customer wins in manufacturing, specifically automotive. We also saw in public sector. We got new logos with new agencies and commercial business which is a massive strength for ServiceNow continue to outperform large new logos. And in my initial commentary, I stated that Americas and Europe also had large logo, new growth. So, this is something that Paul Smith and the team focused on starting with the first quarter and continued to build throughout the year. And as I told, Keith Weiss, this is something we are really, really proud of in terms of just our ability to focus on high-quality logos that matter. And even these logos, whether it's in public sector, manufacturing, financial services or our commercial segment, it's not that we have maxed out. Even this large financial services, they just bought ITSM and ITOM. When I look at a large automotive, it was just ITSM and ITOM. So, yes, we are starting at a bigger scale, but this specific account will continue to expand for us. And one last thing I'll touch on that some of the big ones who became our customer for the first time, our teams did a beautiful job working with the customer that, hey, once you implement, say, ITSM in the next six to nine months, then they have set aside budget for IT asset management or for security or risk. So, that has been also built in as we go into 2024.\nBrad Sills: Thank you, CJ. Great to hear.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Brad.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks Brad.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Darren and thank you very much everyone for joining today's call. ServiceNow closed an outstanding 2023 with a beyond expectations Q4. Here's the state of our business. Artificial intelligence is injecting new fuel into our already high-performing growth engine. The company's Q4 results tell that story. Subscription revenue grew by 25.5% at constant currency, that's 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. cRPO growth is 23% at constant currency, also 200 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 29%, that's approximately 200 basis points above our guidance. We had 168 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, up from 126 a year ago, a 33% increase. ServiceNow's Q4 performance is packed with milestones spanning the full breadth of our portfolio. With technology, customer, and creator, we now have three workflow businesses over $1 billion in ACV. We have 11 individual product lines with north of $250 million in ACV. ITSM, ITOM, and ITAM, each had double-digit deals over $1 million in Q4. Security and risk combined for 12 of the top 20 with nine deals over $1 million. Customer, Employee, and Creator workflows, each had double-digit deals over $1 million. Our large new logo count continued to accelerate in Q4. We had a record 10 new customers signing deals over $1 million in NNACV, including a $10 million win with a very large global financial services firm, which is our largest new customer logo in history. Global iconic brands such as Chipotle, Air France, TIAA, NTT, Data Group Corporation, and Busch are digitally transforming with ServiceNow. We are proud that TIAA, one of our first 10 customers, is still expanding their business with us through new out-of-the-box functionality so they can accelerate time-to-market. Following a record Q3, public sector continued its strong growth in Q4 with key wins including in the United States Army, US Postal Service, and Australian Department of Defense Digital Delivery Group. We are extremely proud to have finished 2023 operating at the rule of 55 plus. As you'll hear from Gina, our 2024 guidance reflects our ongoing belief and ServiceNow's strategic relevance. Our core business is rock solid and growing. Our perimeter is growing. Our platform adoption is growing. We are, in fact, in a new era of business transformation powered by AI. This is unlocking massive opportunity in the enterprise software industry. And ServiceNow is extremely well-positioned, not only to lead this movement, but to define it. 2023 was the latest successful milestone on this journey and we intend to make 2024 an even greater success. To say we're fired up would be an understatement. Let's spend some time framing the dimensions of this new AI world. Gartner estimates $5 trillion in tech spending in 2024, growing to $6.5 trillion by 2027. That means that spending will grow another $1 trillion in only two years, accelerating from the decade plus it took for us to get to $5 trillion. For the first time in a decade, IT services will become bigger than communication services in 2024. Gartner estimates that by 2027, nearly all of the growth in worldwide IT spending will come from software and IT services. And when you drill deeper into the Gartner forecast between 2023 and 2027, $3 trillion will be spent on AI. What we have here is a strong, durable market being supercharged by a once-in-a-generation secular trend. ServiceNow has been investing, innovating and preparing for this wave for years, which is why we're catching it so early. We have a long track record of commercializing breakthrough technologies. When our Pro SKUs were introduced, we saw very exciting traction and customer adoption. Our Pro Plus offerings, which we launched just four months ago with our Vancouver release, are outperforming the pace of the Pro upgrade cycle. Exciting. The results in our first full quarter since launch validate this trajectory. Siemens AG is using Now Assist for HR service delivery to resolve HR cases faster for its entire global workforce. This is one example of many and as always, ServiceNow's strength and our capacity to deploy net new innovation, especially our ambitious Gen AI road map. In Q4, we released significant new capabilities, Virtual Agent Update drives faster issue resolution through advanced conversational AI chat. Employees get the immediate answers they need. Businesses get higher self-solve rates, and it only takes 15 minutes to set it up. Our text to workflow capability dramatically increases developer productivity. ServiceNow's developers have been using text to code for several months. They are generating high-quality code using text to describe the type of code they want. This has increased our developer innovation speed by 52%. Now Assist for field service management reduces cost, while increasing revenue by helping technicians get the job done in the first visit; identifying the necessary equipment, providing repair recommendations, and automating follow-up at speed. Beyond the platform itself, we see AI as a 360-degree strategic imperative. It's why ServiceNow joined the AI Alliance to advance open, safe, and responsible AI. It's also why we are continuing to grow our strategic partnerships to ensure every enterprise can use AI as the cornerstone of business transformation. Today, we expanded our strategic alliance with EY to co-create solutions for generative AI governance for our customers. And of course, EY will also be using ServiceNow's generative AI capabilities to enhance experiences for all of their employees. We also unveiled another major expansion to our partner program, the latest addition in a series of investments as partners are building new business models on the ServiceNow platform. These are two examples of many. I've told ServiceNow's team worldwide that the company is now moving into Phase 5. The culmination of our long-term goal of surpassing $10 billion in ACV, which incidentally only a handful of software companies have ever achieved. We have so much runway ahead for the long-term growth of this company. There are two key elements of our strategy, execution and scale. Execution, we know is an art form. Scale is all about capitalizing on new opportunities as a truly global platform company. One of those in our market making alliance was Visa. Today, ServiceNow and Visa announced a five-year strategic alliance to transform payment service experiences. In the initial phase of the alliance, the companies will launch ServiceNow Disputes Management built with Visa, a single connected solution for dispute resolution. This Gen AI-powered solution will offer end-to-end dispute resolution for customers globally, everything from the first indication of a questionable charge through early investigation to final resolution. Another example is our growing partnership with AWS. Beginning this month, ServiceNow will be available as a SaaS offering in the AWS marketplace. From an automation perspective, we have long believed that identifying legacy process challenges is an active stimulant for new workflows. That's the beauty of our platform. The architecture gives us limitless ways to accelerate speed to value for our customers. And the more workflows we drive, the more value we create. That's why we tucked in UltimateSuite, a task mining company to enhance intelligent automation across the Now platform. If we can help customers find it, ServiceNow can fix it. And we fix it in complete harmony with any existing software landscape, delivered in a consumer-grade user experience. CEOs don't want to wait another decade for technology to finally deliver on its promise. One told me, I'm tired of excuses coming into my boardroom. We need new innovation and new experiences, and we need it now. That's obviously music to our ears and nicely on brand for ServiceNow. There's plenty more to discuss about the company we are building and the progress we're making. We have more accolades than time to listen to them. Top analyst firms ranked ServiceNow as a leader in 14 separate reports in 2023 for our automation and AI capabilities. Glassdoor's recent US Best Places to Work lists ServiceNow as Number Three overall and Number One in software. One of our proudest achievements is the American Opportunity Index. This index is databased. They study what really happens to employees at America's largest companies over time. ServiceNow scored Fifth, and that's out of 400 companies overall and ServiceNow was the Number One technology company on the index. That means that people who have fought hard to build a great company are being rewarded with a great life. This all means so much to us because culture is the glue that binds a winning team together. We have world-class professionals at ServiceNow who care deeply about our customers and our partners. Since Fred Luddy invented the company, we've all made our contributions to help ServiceNow emerge as the hungry and humble winner it is. We believe in our platform. We stick together and we try to have some fun along the way too. That's why the results show up the way they do. It's also why over 1 million people applied to work here last year. To all of our shareholders who continue to invest your trust and ServiceNow, we thank you, and we've got you back. We're building a masterpiece here, and we're only getting started. 2024 will show that we're putting AI to work for the world because now, as ever, the world works with ServiceNow. I look forward to the questions and the discussion we'll have shortly. In the meantime, I'd like to turn the call over to our outstanding Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Yes, Brad, thank you very much for the question. Things are going very well out there, and the momentum is terrific. What's really happening and I can say this after 186 CEO meetings in the last six months, the CEOs are now getting very involved with the Gen AI revolution. They realize there has to be architectural adjustments to their environment and the manner in which they manage their data and the platforms they're beholden to actually take advantage of Gen AI. And if you think about the half a century mess that exists out there with legacy systems, in many cases, multiples of the same system, we have one unifying force in these conversations, which is the Now platform because we cooperate with the complexity of this landscape without putting people in a position to rip and replace. So, they're looking for platforms that matter. We're one of those and I think as Gina said, we are the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. When you have that C-level executive meeting, they really get it now and with regard to Gen AI, the momentum is outstanding. As I said, that SKU has outsold any other new introduction we put into the marketplace. So, there's a real appetite to invest in Gen AI, and there's no price sensitivity around it because the business cases are so unbelievable. I mean if you're improving productivity, 40%, 50%, it just sells itself. So, I think we're in a really, really good place. The Gen AI investments are coming. We're actually getting orders because we have great product, thanks to CJ and his unbelievable engineering team. So, I would tell you at this time last year, compared to this time this year, you should be more bullish now. Thank you, Brad. Yes, I mean, I'll obviously let CJ comment on this also. But you look at the Visa strategic partnership using Gen AI solution to manage end-to-end dispute resolutions with customers. I mean this is one of the great brands in the world, one of the substantial companies. And just think about the impact Gen AI has in a radically simplifying their conversation with their customer and deflecting all the human capital it takes to resolve these cases when technology can do it. If you look at EY and the idea of instilling Gen AI governance on a single pane of glass to manage risk and compliance for some of the biggest corporations in the world. If you look at the opportunity, every single industry has a great opportunity. I was in Germany recently, and I was talking to a home appliance industry participant. Post-COVID, they went from 25% online sales to much more than 50%, and it's growing. So, when CJ and his team brought Field Service Management with Gen AI to the marketplace, just think about one call where the agent instead of -- the rep instead of using a clipboard and a pencil, he's got it on the mobile, knows exactly what part to bring, resolves the case on the spot. That's one part of it, but here is another part of it. The consumer will pay a lot more if they can get a same-day repairs agreement along with the appliance. And the margins on same-day repair are far greater than the box itself, plus you create a nice annuity stream. So, what we're talking about here is fundamentally rethinking the way business is transformed using our platform and Gen AI. And CJ, I know, and I do want to congratulate you and thank you for the job that you continue to do, bringing this innovation to the marketplace. Please give us your thoughts. Thanks a lot Mark. Thank you very much, Arjun, and I really appreciate it. Just a couple of statistics on the customer workflows, 18 of our top 20 deals, what we're seeing is there's a tremendous opportunity to really take ServiceNow and squarely place it on the Customer Relationship Management category. When you think about front, mid and back office and the fact that we can align all three of those things, and nobody has to lose for us to win. We could fill in all the blanks for what the current participants don't do, especially with their integration problems. It's just a fantastic opportunity for our customers. And I think it's important to note, when I gave the Field Service Management example, our net new ACV in Field Service Management, specifically was up over 50% and year-over-year. So, I think it's important to recognize that we have a whole list of new logos in this space. And employee workflows, nine of our top 20 deals and was kind of interesting. Every single CEO now is looking to make the people packed far more productive than it is and with natural language to have your employees seek the data and the information they want and have it reported back to them in just a very nice paragraph of content and data so they can do their jobs better, is kind of like in the no-brainer category. And we have some really great logos that I'm sure CJ would like to share with you as well. But both of those areas are really good. And incidentally, that employee spot that I mentioned was up 80% year-over-year. Thank you. Yes. May I also just add one thing, Kash. If you think about every single industry, they all have their own personality. So, for example, I had the opportunity to meet a pharma company. And as you know, the average life cycle, for example, for clinical trials is over six and a half years. And this is an industry that drops $200 billion a year on this clinical trial process and 90% of them fail. So, if you just think about that for a minute, you say, well, what can generative AI do to automate document generation, for example, that would be in line with regulatory protocols and you come up with site contracting agreements, for example, that also include the patient, because the patient has to be engaged in the process, otherwise, they won't stay in the trial. And every time a patient opts out, they lose money, $20,000 per patient. So, generative AI on the ServiceNow platform obviously can go in there and radically cut down the cycle-time of these clinical trials. So, CEOs right out of the gates are ready to go. Your team, my team, let's figure this out. So, there's a real appetite. And I think why I'm so bullish is we have a platform that already has it. Thank you, Kash. And Keith, Gina doesn't brag about this, neither does Russ Elmer, who is our Office of General Counsel lead. We're using the Now platform. So, in all the back office functions of the company, we're so automated, so productive. And they're getting things done on the Now platform that it would take other companies five and six times the headcount to do the same job. And that is really something. We actually even had with legal service delivery, AI tell us that we're spending too much time on contracts less than $250,000. Our office of General Counsel, Russ made the decision based on AI that we could fundamentally change that and reorient the workflow around those kinds of agreements, which gave us a huge rush, and he didn't have to hire anybody. And then he actually took that product and our great engineering team built it. We call it LSD, Legal Service Delivery and now lawyers all over the world, they want to jump on. So, everything we do internally with Now on Now as an external marketing force associated with it. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Mike. Yes, I think we were -- I think, Mike, you called it. I think we were at 23 out of 24 of the world's largest and most significant ones. And now we're at 24 out of 24. And I just seriously want to credit the amazing platform of ServiceNow, the MRA process and integrated risk management and the complexity of going into an environment like that is pretty serious stuff. And to have a marquee brand trust us and believe in us and believe in ServiceNow the way they did is really inspiring. And I really have to turn it over to CJ and give him so much credit for the hard work that he put into it. And I know firsthand because I had the front row seat to watching it and how we spent time with this wonderful customer. And CJ, I'm sure you got some color that you might want to put on that. Thank you very Karl. Appreciate it. Yes. Well, thank you very much for the question. I really appreciate it. Our federal business is really outstanding. And for the benefit of our shareholders, I think that there's a tremendous opportunity to replicate what we're doing in the United States federal and many other governments around the world. That is clearly an ambition that we have, and we have many use cases and many references to back that up. So, CJ, I think you spent a lot of time with our team. And I know that I mentioned some of the names like United States Army, United States Postal Service as an example, really marquee wins, really, really important stuff. Why don't you build on that? Thank you. Thank you, Brad."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Happy New Year to all of you who are listening in. Q4 was another exceptional quarter to conclude what has been a phenomenal year. Once again, we exceeded our topline growth and operating margin guidance metrics, showcasing our team's relentless focus on execution. ServiceNow's agility in responding to enterprise needs has solidified our position as the trusted intelligent platform for driving digital transformation. In Q4, subscription revenues were $2.365 billion, growing 25.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. We closed out 2023 with $8.68 billion in subscription revenues, also representing 25.5% constant currency growth. All organic at a scale that hasn't been accomplished by any other enterprise software company. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $18 billion representing an acceleration to 27.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. cRPO was $8.6 billion, representing 23% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 200 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities, business and consumer services, and education were particularly robust in the quarter. Government control continued to show impressive growth and Telecom, Media, and Technology also saw strength. As Bill noted, I'm pleased to announce that customer workflows crossed $1 billion in ACV in Q4 fast following our Creator Workflows, which hit that momentous milestone in just Q3. We now have three workflow categories generating over $1 billion in ACV, highlighting the breadth of our portfolio. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 99% in Q4, continuing to demonstrate the strategic relevance of the Now platform as it remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. We ended the year with over 8,100 customers with our focus on landing the right new customers continuing to bear fruit as large new logo growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. We ended Q4 with 1,897 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. We closed 168 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year, that includes five deals over $10 million. And for the full year 2023, we saw an approximate 30% increase in deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. In Q4, our Gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution for our first full quarter of any of our new product family releases ever, including our original Pro SKU. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin exceeded 29%, approximately 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by the topline outperformance and disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 55%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. For the full year 2023 operating margin was 28% and free cash flow margin was 30%. Total free cash flow for 2023 was a robust $2.7 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $8.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q4, we repurchased 400,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have $962 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability, and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. We are raising our 2024 outlook to reflect the strong momentum with which we exited 2023. This partially reflects the early success we've seen with our Gen AI products as those investments are accelerating the build of our already robust pipeline with customers lining up to be first movers in this next wave of business transformation. As always, we continue to be prudent around our assumptions for incremental customer budgets and the macro cost in our guidance. With that in mind, let's turn to 2024 guidance. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $165 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.555 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, reflecting investments in our data centers and emerging growth opportunities, offset by 100 basis point benefit from a change in useful life of our data center equipment from four to five years resulting from an assessment completed earlier this month. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 28% to 29%, driven by continued OpEx efficiencies. We expect free cash flow margin of 31%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, overcoming an incremental point of cash tax headwinds. Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 208 million. For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $2.510 billion and $2.515 billion, representing 24% to 24.5% year-over-year growth or 23.5% to 24% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects the tremendous strength of our federal business, which has resulted in a higher mix of 12-month contracts that will create a negative 150 basis point impact to Q1 cRPO growth. We expect that these contracts will renew in Q3 as ServiceNow's federal contract renewal rates are 99%. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect 208 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, ServiceNow's Q4 outperformance is another example of the strength of our platform and our people. This team's amazing accomplishments in 2023 set the stage for continued success in 2024. ServiceNow is positioned as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation, has gained momentum throughout the year, leaders are shifting their investments into proven strategic platforms that leverage the power of AI to deliver growth across the top and bottom lines, with customers prioritizing quick time to value the Now Platform delivers. The accelerating pace of investment in workflow automation and interest in Gen AI positions us well on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Bill, CJ, and I would like to extend our gratitude to all our employees worldwide for their outstanding contributions to ServiceNow's success this past year. 2023 was a remarkable year, and we look forward to an even more exciting 2024. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Hi Keith, this is Gina. Thanks so much for the question. So, yes, we're really proud of the beat on the topline as well as the bottom-line in Q4 and obviously continuing to expand those margins in 2024. Specifically, when you think about investments in R&D head count, it's all around continued innovation and our investments in Gen AI and AI. And so not surprising given the commentary that you've already heard, we're continuing to double down in investments on fingers on keyboards, engineers really driving the Gen AI revolution. So, you'll continue to see more of that. On the sales side, it's really about scale and leverage, right? And so sales and marketing head count, there's a lot in there. It's not just quota-bearing feet on the street sales, right? So, you've got marketing, you've got marketing operations, you have sales operations in there. If you actually were able to break it down to feet-on-the-street quota-bearing sales, you would see that growth rate much higher. And in fact, as I think about sales capacity going into 2024, we have a larger increase in ramped reps going into 2024 than we've had in years. So, from a capacity perspective, we feel great about how we're entering 2024. Awesome. Thanks for the question Keith. Absolutely. Productivity and efficiency is going up as well as the fact that from a scale perspective, you're not growing some of the operational heads as much. And we'll be definitely increasing hiring as we go into 2024 as you would expect. Yes, sure. So, we beat our Q4 cRPO growth guidance by 200 basis points as you know. And I would say it's driven probably half and half by net new ACV outperformance and certainly, Gen AI is in there, but it's not all Gen AI. So, our core business is also doing well. And then we also did see higher early renewals than we had assumed in our guidance. And I would say it's about half and half of the total beat. Sure, Alex, it's Gina. What I'd say is and we called this out in my script, right? At the end of the day, Gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution in the first full quarter of any of our new product family releases ever, including original Pro SKU. So, I get the question often, do we the adoption curve to be steeper for our Pro Plus than our Pro. Certainly, in the first full quarter of launch, it absolutely has shown that. That being said, it's very early days. And so from a revenue contribution perspective, it's not going to be huge, but it's certainly helped when I thought about my guide for 2024 and that increase of $165 million at the midpoint, right? So Gen AI, early days, but the adoption curve so far is steeper than the original Pro. We will keep an eye on it. And as the numbers get larger, we will continue to update you and everyone else as to the penetration. But right now, excitement and interest from our customer base is much stronger than we ever saw in the first -- in early days of our Pro SKU, and we're excited by that momentum at the same time being conservative as I think about the guidance for 2024 because it's still so early. Yes. So, we called out the 150 basis point impact in Q1 that increases to about 200 basis points in Q2, so we expect similar levels from Q1 to Q2. I'm not going to guide out any further than that at this point. But what I'll tell you is that I increased the full year 2024 guide by $165 million. We remain as confident as ever in our guide of $15 billion plus in 2026. And Gen AI and the innovation in our -- all of our product portfolio is going to help drive that growth. Thanks Alex. Thanks Mike. Thanks Karl. Thanks Peter for the question. What I'd say is that we are -- we feel great about our expansion rates at the scale that we're at as well as on new logo growth. So, CJ mentioned earlier, our new logo growth, especially in our larger customers, has been an accelerating each and every year and each and every quarter over the last several years. And so at our scale, our expansion rates remain extremely strong, and as does our net new logo growth. And so you will continue to see a nice mix of existing customers upselling with us as well as new logos joining us. And so we hit $8.7 billion in revenue going to $10.575 billion next year. At our scale, these expansion rates are best-in-class, and we remain extremely proud of them. Thanks Brad."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Darren Yip, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDarren Yip: Good afternoon and thank you for joining ServiceNow third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer.

On behalf of Gina, CJ, and our entire company, I'd like to first make a brief statement about recent events. ServiceNow has a very special team in Israel. One of our own colleagues Shlomi Sividia was at the Supernova Music Festival. He was murdered in the unprecedented and heinous attack. Shlomi was highly respected, admired, and a good friend to many. We stand in solidarity with our team and with their families. Terrorism has caused the unfathomable humanitarian crisis and now engulfs millions of people in Israel and Gaza. Our hearts pray for the innocent on all sides. Even with optimism in short supply, we choose to honor the dream of a peaceful and prosperous future for the Middle East region. God bless and protect all those in harm's way. Now for business. Of course, that's the reason we're here to discuss ServiceNow's Q3 results. We're proud that our company once again delivered beyond expectation. ServiceNow has delivered subscription revenue that grew by 24.5% in constant currency, over one point above our guidance. cRPO grew a strong 24%. That's 2.5 points above our guidance. Operating margin was 30%, more than 2.5 points above our guidance. We had 83 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV, up from 69 a year ago, a 20% increase year-over-year. Our focus on landing the right new customers, continued to deliver. Large new logo growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. ServiceNow's traction as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation has intensified. All of our workflow businesses were in 14 or more of the top 20 deals, ITSM, ITOM, ITAM, security and risk, customer, employee, and creator. Within our technology workflows, security and risk had a very strong quarter, with 10 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows had a stellar quarter with seven deals over 1 million and one deal over 10 million. From an industry perspective, this was the best US Federal quarter in ServiceNow's history. NNACV was up over 75% year-over-year. US Federal agencies are standardizing on a single platform with a core set of end-to-end solutions. We had 19 federal deals over 1 million, including three deals over 10 million. Our top deal in the quarter, the United States Air Force was the third largest deal in the company's history. You'll hear from Gina that this performance has heightened our confidence for a strong Q4. We're increasing the full year guidance on the top line and the bottom line and here is the key takeaway. AI has strengthened the market dynamics for enterprise software. ServiceNow is the fastest-growing company in this market at relative scale. We have the highest rule of 50 plus across our peer set with the highest growth of any other large-cap software company. We are the best performing enterprise software company to IPO. This is a unique, highly differentiated company that is rewriting the benchmarks to be best-in-class in the SaaS industry. Looking beyond the quarterly results, while the world's challenges are sobering, the digitization imperative is stronger than ever. Gartner forecasts that $3 trillion will be spent on AI and GenAI between 2023 and 2027. GenAI represents 36% of AI spending overall. We believe every dollar of global GDP will be impacted by AI over the next several years. This isn't a hype cycle. It is a generational movement. In the last year, ServiceNow has doubled down on our AI investments. Our Vancouver release includes generative AI-powered Now Assist for every workflow. Others issued press releases. We released product. At ServiceNow, our strategy isn't about exuberance. It's about execution. We carefully laid the groundwork for success and talent and resources and technology. This investment is accelerating our already robust pipeline with customers lining up to be first-movers in this next wave of business transformation. The question we've been asked repeatedly, does AI drive growth? The definitive answer is, yes, it does. GenAI represents a tailwind of growth for ServiceNow. We have over 300 customers in our pipeline from every industry, every buying center and every stage of testing. Our GenAI SKU drove the highest number of customer requests for a pre-release product in our history. We launched Vancouver on September 29th. That left us one day in Q3 to sign deals, and we signed four large deals. A US government agency selected our premium SKU offerings, to be an early adopter of GenAI. Real estate leader, CBRE is harnessing generative AI with ServiceNow to deliver superior service to customers and employees, while reducing costs. NVIDIA is accelerating its own ServiceNow journey with generative AI. Among other leading companies, Teleperformance joined ServiceNow's AI Lighthouse program. They will collaborate on new generative AI use cases that boost productivity while increasing customer and employee satisfaction in key industries. We have a wide range of other customer wins in the quarter as well. FedEx is using ServiceNow to simplify their IT workflows, while building a universal employee portal to improve employee experience for a 0.5 million global employees. One of the world's largest automakers selected ServiceNow to help consolidate dozens of applications into a new modern platform to accelerate their push into the EV market. Philips, Mars, Bank of California, Cleveland Clinic, the US Department of Defense, Fujitsu, Asahi Mutual Insurance, and the State of California are among many others. We see a meaningful path for all customers to recognize value from generative AI, in the quarters to come. Our innovation velocity is very high. Pipeline is growing fast and capacity to execute is well proven and this is just the beginning. Looking holistically at our business, we see progress everywhere. We have an aspiration to significantly increase the percentage of net new revenue, sourced by our partners in the coming years. This is about partners making the ServiceNow platform the core of their emerging business models. One exciting example is our customer Trane Technologies. They are a global climate innovator, which recently announced plans to acquire ServiceNow partner Nuvolo. With Nuvolo, Trane Technologies can bring world-class digital solutions, engineered on the ServiceNow platform to their global customer base. This creates a flywheel effect to ServiceNow, more use cases, drive more workflow automation. And today, we're excited to share that Deloitte and ServiceNow announced an expansion to our alliance. Deloitte will become a pioneering partner, integrating our generative AI capabilities into their leading operate services globally. This addition underscores Deloitte's commitment to enhance performance with cross-industry solutions built on the ServiceNow platform. We're also scaling our ecosystem globally, with today's announcement of a co-investment in ANSR, a market leader in enabling companies to scale technology centers. Another area that we expect to fuel long-term sustainable growth is industry verticalization. Our product development roadmap is expanding with use cases and telecommunications, financial services, retail and the public sector. And beyond any one industry, we increasingly see both intra and inter-enterprise workflow opportunities on the ServiceNow platform. This new generation of business networks is creating value chains that transcend traditional business boundaries. Our rapid pace of workflow innovation creates an even greater demand for our training and skills initiative, RiseUp with ServiceNow. As one example, FutureSkills Prime, a digital skilling initiatives of the Indian government will train thousands of learners across India in new digital skills. This partnership offers clear pathways to build careers as businesses worldwide grow at ServiceNow workforce. Bottom line this all points to grow at ServiceNow. In closing, we are building a company for the ages, by concentrating on customer value, we are creating immense shareholder value. At a strategic level, we chose to set the bar high, to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. We have an inspired team that is committed to our exponential dream. A company is only as great as each member of the team and the team is only as great as the company. That is what culture is all about. Our employee engagement scores increased across the board this year, so did our retention rates, which are already best-in class. We never went for layoffs. We went for thoughtful, careful expansion. When you look at the ongoing momentum from Knowledge '23, it's clear the approach is working. A profitable growth profile of this company speaks for itself. The market is there for us and now we're focused on Q4, delivering a strong full year and a fast start in 2024 as well. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to your questions. Now, I'll turn it over to our outstanding CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q3 marks another quarter of strong execution, as we once again significantly surpassed the high end of our topline growth and profitability guidance metrics. ServiceNow continues to demonstrate its resilience as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. Customers are seeking enhanced productivity solutions in the current macroenvironment and ServiceNow is delivering. In Q3, subscription revenues of $2.216 billion, growing 24.5% year-over-year in constant-currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 100 basis points, amazing organic growth at massive scale. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14.4 billion, representing 23.5% year-over-year constant-currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.43 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant-currency growth, and a 250 basis point beat versus our guidance. As Bill highlighted, Federal has best net new ACV quarter ever, growing over 75% year-over-year. I want to give a quick shout out to the Federal team, who has just been crushing it. Among the other industries, transportation and logistics was very strong, growing over a 100% year-over-year, followed by education, which grew over 75%. Manufacturing and CMC also saw robust growth. We had some outstanding achievements from a workflow standpoint as well. I'm pleased to announce that Creator Workflows crossed 1 billion in ACV in Q3, a monumental milestone, and our Employee Pro SKU saw over 100% growth in net new ACV year-over-year. Retention remained exceptional with the renewal rate of 98% in Q3 reaffirming the essential role the Now Platform plays in our customers' operations. Our customer cohorts displayed solid expansion as the quarter closed with 1,789 customers contributing over 1 million in ACV, with 58% year-over-year growth in those contributing over $20 million. In Q3, we successfully closed 83 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV, with four deals greater than 10 million. Notably, 18 of our top 20 net new ACV deals included eight or more products. By launching at the end of the quarter we have already -- we have also already closed four GenAI-related enterprise deals and we're seeing strong pipeline build for our plus SKUs. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, over 250 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management, and the top-line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 9%, up 300 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7 billion in cash and investments. In Q3 we repurchased, 0.5 million shares as part of our first-ever share repurchase program, with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. We are raising the full-year outlook to reflect the strength of Q3. As we have done all year, we continue to prudently factor the macro cross-wins into our guidance. This includes incremental FX headwind from a strengthening US dollar. For 2023, we are raising our subscription revenues outlook by $48 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.635 billion to $8.640 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth or 25% on a constant-currency basis. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 26.5% to 27%. And we continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and GAAP-diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.320 billion and $2.325 billion, representing 24.5% to 25% year-over-year growth or 23% to 23.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20.5% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Notably, the strength of our federal business has resulted in a higher mix of 12-month contracts that will create a one point headwind to Q4 cRPO growth and remain a headwind into 2024. We expect that these contracts will renew in 2024 as ServiceNow's federal contract renewal rate are 99%. We expect an operating margin of 27.5% and we expect 206 million GAAP-diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, our team delivered an exceptional performance across the board. With a culture focused on customer success, our people have worked relentlessly to provide solutions to meet enterprise's needs, and it's showing in our robust results. Businesses are looking to consolidate vendors and standardize on a platform with a core set of products, so they can build a predictable and reliable roadmap to drive digital transformation. ServiceNow is that strategic platform. With the addition of our Vancouver release, and the capabilities presented by GenAI, the window of opportunity is even more expansive than ever before. The result is a more powerful, and intelligent platform, that enables customers to ignite end-to-end action, across the enterprise in ways not seen before. It's an exciting opportunity to further improve productivity, and employee satisfaction, optimize processes, reduce costs, and create organizational agility. The possibilities are endless. Bill and I extent our gratitude to all our employees worldwide for their unwavering dedication and commitment that puts us at the forefront of this opportunity, and further driving ServiceNow towards its ambition of becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. If I look at the mix in product -- on the product side, it looks like ITSM and ITOM was very strong this quarter. Can you little bit speak to that? I sense it's probably the big Federal deals, but maybe more broadly what you see in the different product categories. Many thanks and congrats from me.\nCJ Desai: Hey, Raimo, thank you so much, this is CJ, for the question. Great to hear from you. ITSM and ITOM which we define from a solution perspective as service operation is code of our core. So, as Bill outlined that we had very strong new logo business, and new logos that matter, where we almost always plan with ITSM and ITOM, and in general, we are seeing that ITSM continues to have expansion rates, whether it's via Pro SKUs, or just recently added Pro Plus, and with ITOM and our AIOps strategy, we continue to execute on not only the product roadmap, but how our customers are leveraging those innovations from visibility all the way to health in that digital real estate.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nCJ Desai: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hello. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Bill, CJ, and Gina. Outstanding results. Bill, we've -- we've all been waiting for this recession. Some houses have been calling for a hard landing, and some others aren't. It looks like we've been waiting for ever since the recession to happen, it's not happening. And I'm sure that CEOs that you do business with are -- have been somewhat cautious the last three to four quarters, but it looks like things are stable, and with the tailwind of potentially a soft landing, if I could use that expression, a software landing and AI, as wind -- as wind in your sales, what does the company's growth prospects look like in '24 versus the last couple of years that we've all been slogging through this, granted that you have been executing really well outperforming your peer group. What does the growth curve look like with all these tailwinds ahead of you? Thank you so much and congrats.\nBill McDermott: Well, Kash, thank you. I think that's the reason why we've raised our guidance on top of an outstanding quarter like this because we have great confidence in the core business. All CEOs right now are either in a move to increase productivity because of the crosswinds that you referenced in the macro or take costs out. And obviously, while doing so, they also have the added challenge of new business model innovation, such as the auto industry, now dealing with the transition to EV. What's unique about ServiceNow is digital transformation can deflect so many of the cost, and hence the labor-intensive procedures that companies have to deal with to properly serve their market. On top of that, you have one-third of the productivity of knowledge workers getting torn apart by swivel chairing between on average 13 individual applications a day. Now you add the productivity tailwind of generative AI on this once-in-a-generation ServiceNow platform, and you have achieved a very important business transformation. And I think right now, CEOs are focused on business transformation, and when you can give them one common UX that is consumer-grade, that integrates with a half-a-century-old legacy mess that they have to contend with, and we can get the actions that they need done, done, done to achieve cost-out productivity and growth on, they're all about ServiceNow now, and that's why you're seeing these results, and they are sustainable.\nKash Rangan: Amazing. Thank you so much. Very inspired.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, the beat on constant-currency current RPO was one of the largest we've seen in quite a while. Could you just unpack was that mostly federal, or was it broad based? And then secondly, Gina, on the current RPO outlook for Q4, can you just help us understand the dynamic with the one point headwind a little bit better? Did Q3 also face that headwind given you booked so many of these large federal contracts? Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: So, thanks. Tyler, thanks so much for the question. So yes, we're very excited. Q3 results were just phenomenal across the board, and the beat on constant-currency cRPO was two things, specifically strong net new ACV growth, and that was primarily driven, but not entirely, primarily, not entirely driven by very strong federal business, which was just fantastic and great business for us. We also did have better federal early renewals. If you remember, we've been really prudent in how we've been forecasting early renewals, given the current macroenvironment. And so the beat this quarter was two-pronged right. So strong net new ACV growth as well as strong early renewals. To your question on the impact of Q4 cRPO and the one point headwind, how Federal agencies usually contract is one year out, right. So their contracts are only 12 months in duration. So it doesn't have a negative impact on Q3, right, because at the end of Q3, you have it in their peripheral year. But at the end of Q4, with one quarter of those contracts roll-off cRPO, it means that there is a headwind to Q4 and because Q4, sorry, because Federal was so strong, and the mix of federal in Q3 was stronger than we've ever seen before, there is that headwind into Q4. But again, as you think about the underlying business, extremely strong results, in fact, Federal business has a strong renewal rate at 99%. So as you think about the underlying health of the business going into '24, it remains very strong.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nBill McDermott: Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Yeah, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith. I wanted to congratulate the team on the 24% constant -- on the current RPO growth. That was really impressive. You know, Bill, when I looked at what you were talking about in terms of GenAI trials, and landing four customers right at the end of the quarter, in terms of your -- the team's expectation about adoption of IT -- ITSM Pro Plus versus Pro, is there -- do you see a scenario where that adoption could potentially happen faster than the cadence of adoption that you've seen over the last five years with ITSM Pro? I appreciate the -- I appreciate the thoughts.\nBill McDermott: Well I can -- I can tell you that we, first of all, I appreciate your question, Keith. You know how well we have done with the Pro version of the platform and there's still plenty of room to expand on that, but the demand that we've seen so far for Pro Plus, and the transformational nature of what customers are now able to do on the Now Platform has led to the single best type that we have seen at ServiceNow. I'll let CJ give you some color on individual customers and some of the actual stories that, I think, you'll find illuminating.\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. Thank you, Bill, and thanks for the question. So, we have one data point from the last week of September, which, I do not want to translate it to trend. However, we are having many, many conversations with some of the iconic companies, and public sector customers, around ServiceNow's generative AI offering. So when we launched in 2018 Q3 the Pro SKUs, that was a curve that followed over multiple quarters, now 20 quarters, and we know what that looks like. With Pro Plus, what I'm seeing is, it is no longer about the potential of generative AI, where they are questioning is generative AI good for us in context of ServiceNow platform, but the conversations have shifted to, hey, CJ, how long would be -- would it take for us to implement? Does our data strategy need to be aligned, and what about the security, et cetera. So the positive side of this is that we are seeing good demand, and on the cautionary side is, we will work with our customers. They are learning. Like Bill said, the four customers who leaned in and bought our products on the last day of the quarter, but as we move forward, we'll work with these customers, and as we get a couple of quarters under the belt, we will be able to tell you how this is looking versus Pro. So Pro Plus versus Pro.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the additional thoughts, CJ. Thank you very much.\nBill McDermott: And Keith, one thing to keep in mind is Pro is the necessary stepping stone to Pro Plus. So, from a shareholder value creation standpoint, it's plus-plus.\nSanjit Singh: Well noted. Thanks Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Keith.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks for taking my question. And Gina, thanks for all the detail around cRPO. That's really helpful in understanding that metric and I know we've talked about this in the past, but I mean that it's helpful. My question is really around the federal business, which is really -- it's been really strong for at least a year more than offsetting any commercial weakness when it happens like maybe a year ago or so. And just adding to what -- at least what I think is surprising commercial strength as cash sort of hit on that in periods like this quarter. I guess my question is, how sustainable is that federal business in regards to new ACV, which it sounds like it just continues. It's like the energizer bunny, it just sort of keeps on giving.\nBill McDermott: Yes. John, I'll start off and then let Gina give you some of her color as well. But our federal business, as I said, had the biggest quarter in ServiceNow's history with 75% year-over-year growth in NNACV, and we had 19 deals that were more than 1 million, including three over 10 million with the US Air Force as the third biggest deal in the history of ServiceNow. And what we're seeing is across all areas, federal agencies are really looking to consolidate contracts, point solutions, the messy middle, and they really want to standardize on a platform with a core set of products that they can grow with. And our GenAI offerings, for example, are really reinforcing our ability to help accelerate their transformation journey, and they're seeing really tremendous opportunity in GenAI on our platform. And we're already seeing early adopters show an interest in domain-specific models, which offer better security, as CJ said, and we're working with some agencies that I can tell care a lot about security. So I think it's really a tribute to ServiceNow's engineering and the way ServiceNow runs our cloud and the manner in which we care for our customers at a deep technical level and they know that they can count on that. And every agency where we've done business is highly referenceable and they're telling our story to other agencies for us. It's really a beautiful force multiplying situation. But I want to leave you with one thought. We're only getting started. With federal, with state, with local, the business transformation that's going to go on in the next decade across all of those categories will play beautifully into our growth agenda, and we'll continue to service it with 100% customer satisfaction. We are fired up with what we're able to do to transform government and make it run like a best run business.\nGina Mastantuono: The only thing, I would add, and Bill, fantastic answer. The only thing, I would add, John, is that, this is durable demand. The Federal agency's digitization agenda is only growing, and the success that we've had at Federal, we absolutely have the ability to replicate that outside of the US and public sector around the world.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you very much.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, John.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, John.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Bill, the level of confidence that we hear from SIs on maintaining this kind of 20% plus growth trajectory for their ServiceNow practices is truly standing out across the software landscape. One of them surveyed their customers, and the top three topics of interest that came back were Microsoft, Azure, and ServiceNow. So, just in light of that, that joint prioritization there, could you shed a little light on traction with your Microsoft relationship? Is that kicking in already at this stage, and are you able to go to market as a bit of a one-two punch with the Azure co-pilots and Now Assist?\nBill McDermott: Yeah. I'll start off, and then please, CJ, feel free to add your opinion on this as well, but our partnership with Microsoft is really geared to open additional addressable market for ServiceNow. And we're doing that by creating and expanding co-sell motion with Microsoft's enterprise sales teams. So that would talk to one-two punch, and ServiceNow is really helping streamline their migrations to Azure, while Azure exposes us to a much wider spectrum of customers. So we saw the partnership influence deals across geos in Q3, including government wins in Americas, and APAC as real driving forces between both Microsoft and ServiceNow. And we really are confident that the partnership, and the synergy with Microsoft does enable us to bring value to more customers, and do so at an unprecedented speed, and I do want to say, that we've been friends, with Satya and myself on a personal level for a long time, and we've done a lot of business together, and the friendship that exists with CJ and the engineering team at Microsoft is very rock-solid, and we trust each other, and we see that our mutual interest is better by working together, but also, we're doing it in the name of the customer. And I think that's the big thing. And I just want to complement CJ and our engineering team, not just for the 5,00 new innovations they brought to the platform this year, that would have been enough, but also for the hands-on relationship with great partners like Microsoft because you got to remember, everything we have has been integrated into Microsoft, from Office 365, to Dynamics, to Teams, to Azure, to AIOps, it's pretty -- pretty amazing when you think about the engineering work and talent that went into putting this together. So this isn't just by let's go to market and two is better than one. This is deep technical integration to serve customers at an unprecedented level.\nCJ Desai: Bill, you said it well. Mark, the only thing, great to hear from you. The only thing I would add is the engineering collaboration is absolutely necessary, but not sufficient when it comes to go-to-market partnership and relationship we have, working with Microsoft. So, whether it's our financial services customers or healthcare or government customers, when they are trying to leverage ServiceNow, hey, where are my assets? Are my assets healthy? Are they secure? Whether they are running on-prem, or in Azure, we have the best-in class partnership with Microsoft and that is definitely being noticed by some of our largest, as well as mid-sized customers, and brand-new customers.\nMark Murphy: Thank you for that extra texture and congrats.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Mark.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Maybe I'll direct this one to Gina. Gina, I know from the past when you've had strong Fed quarters that by virtue of those deals, they tend to have, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, a little bit more upfront RevRec. So I'm just curious, you laid out the impact on cRPO, but how does that strong Fed quarter that you saw in September impact the reported subscription revenue, and margins that you put up, and if you could, in any way, maybe size that lift given that, I think, there is more upfront RevRec? Much appreciate it.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah, it's a great question, Karl. Actually quarter-over quarter, year-over-year on-prem has remained consistent. So that hasn't been an impact and so the strength in our revenue in the quarter was the result of extremely fantastic execution by the team.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Good to hear. Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much. So it's really interesting that you signed four large deals on September 30th, literally, right after the availability of Vancouver, and Now Assist and it sounds like your GenAI Tech was a clear catalyst, if not the catalyst for these transactions. So I guess for Bill or CJ, I assume these were all existing customers, but did they all purchase Pro Plus, did any of them purchase Enterprise Plus or any have been deploying your new text-to-code functionality? Just curious to hear any additional color that you might be able to share. Thank you.\nCJ Desai: Hey, Gregg. Thanks for the question. I'll take this question. I would say, just to summarize because we, in the Vancouver release, launched Now Assist for our four flagship product lines which is ITSM, HR, customer service, and Creator. So let's start with that, and those are all resonating whether our customers want text-to-code or text-to-workflow capabilities, or they want their employees to be more productive, or they want their IT staff or customer service agents to be more productive. So, depending on the customer, and what they solving for, all of them are resonating really well. So this was driven mainly on Pro Plus, but these were Pro customers, who also bought Pro Plus. So one example, one of the customers who did buy this on September 29th, specifically, said to me, hey, CJ, you know, we had the most successful ITSM roll-out. Now, we want to buy Pro Plus, and they're on ITSM Pro already, and we just want our employee experience to be great, versus another customer that Bill mentioned, they said, not only we want to solve for our employees, but also our end customers. So these four specific transactions were across the board, resulting in very strategic and significant wins. As we move forward, I would tell you that what is still resonating with our customers is the speed to value. This is not something where now large language models need to be fine-tuned for one customer at a time, and the way our engineering team has implemented this solution, I can tell you, Generative AI is probably one of the best, if not the best complement I have seen to ServiceNow platform, where you can use generative AI to look up something to summarize something, and then you take action via ServiceNow platform.\nGregg Moskowitz: Fantastic. Thanks, CJ.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Hi. Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Bill and CJ, I was wondering if you could just talk about the concept of starting to deliver AI solutions that are more vertically oriented. How far away are you from that? How much of the verticalization do you want to take on, and how much do you want to leave to your partners to sort of take some of these use cases with GenAI into verticals with specific vertical technology? Thanks.\nCJ Desai: Thanks. So, first of all, Kirk, thank you for the question. When we start, and you know, yesterday we had our Board of Directors meeting and similar question was asked, we're first prioritized on our core set of use case that cut across every single industry. We are very focused on that, we are ITSM customer service, HR, as well as our Creator offerings. As we look forward though, there are specific use cases within financial services or healthcare types of customers or even government. So, I'll give you an example. Some of our public sector customers, they asked us, hey, CJ and the team, can you provide us a solution, that can potentially run on-prem, given the nature of that agency, and our engineering team delivered that for our public sector customer. So, I would consider that as a vertical solution, that we had to create, for our public sector customers. But as we take it to the next level, post this core set of use cases across our four workflows, we will definitely be prioritizing financial services and TMT moving forward.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. Maybe just two quick ones from me. Clearly, you know, the story of this quarter was the unbelievable Federal growth that you guys posted. Maybe ex-Federal, to the extent of the incremental challenges, or lack of thereof from the macro and pipeline, like, what's the story of the quarter ex-Fed, and then some of the deals that you guys referenced either on the Pro Plus side, or just a very large deal side, like, maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment? Are you taking them away from some of your front office peers, or kind of how does that shape up as you look at the pipeline?\nCJ Desai: Yeah, Alex, thanks for the question. This is CJ. First of all, you know, yes, Federal had a phenomenal quarter, and it's been talked about by both Bill and Gina, but we also saw strength in certain industries, and certain geographies across the board. We won't be able to produce these kind of results, and this kind of beat on cRPO with our strengths in other industries and other geographies. So that's what I would say at the highest level that there were a lot of other strengths, and even from a use case or a workflow perspective, Bill already outlined, that our employee workflow, which is now customers are asking us this question that we want our employee productivity to be high, and what is ServiceNow's solution because employees waste too much time swivel chairing or looking for information, so we saw significant growth there, but the growth was across the board, given from a workflow perspective as all four workflows grew very, very nicely. And Alex, you know, how much I pay attention to that. The second thing I would say on Pro and Pro Plus, what we are seeing is that customers understand ServiceNow strategy is very specific to ServiceNow use cases. And one of the things that I realized after having this Pro Plus conversations with customers on a large sample size that, generative AI or our Pro Plus SKU is a productivity multiplier. It's not a productivity enhancer. When you have a productivity multiplier, and you can articulate what kind of productivity gains they will get, that is when they say, okay, we got it. And now, let's forget what are the pricing, and other things. So, competitive dynamics wise, from a generative AI standpoint for overall this Pro Plus SKU, it is still in the context of ServiceNow. How much value will they get, how fast will they get that value, and how much they're willing to pay.\nBill McDermott: And, Alex, if I may build on what CJ said, I can give you some additional color, if you like. One thing that might be of interest to you is in Americas, the number of $5 million plus deals actually more than quadrupled year-over-year, and the number of $10 million plus deal doubled year-over-year, and I think as CJ laid out beautifully, technology and employee workflows were enormously successful. And in EMEA, our 1 million plus deals grew 70% year-over-year now, which means that the platform and multiple components of the solutions that our great engineering team builds is resonating, and we're seeing particular uplift now in government and manufacturing. And one interesting fact. We have these world forums coming up in London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Rotterdam, and we have 1 billion plus pipeline that's registered for those events. So, we feel good about that. And APJ, when you think about it, 1 million plus deals increased 40% year-over-year, and Japan is continuing to impress us with the unprecedented opportunity of the world's third-largest economy as Germany is as well. So, we're seeing lots of real growth opportunities on the global stage, and I think Gina pointed that out earlier as well.\nAlex Zukin: Super insightful, guys. Thank you very much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you. Thanks, Alex.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great, thank you so much. Looks like an uptick here in headcount this quarter, sales and marketing hires net adds, looks like more than 500 R&D, almost 400. Would love to get some color on some of those areas of prioritizing -- that you're prioritizing in the investment, both in sales and marketing and R&D. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah. Brad, listen, this is a tale of continued execution. We've been very focused on adding heads and investing in our R&D resources, and our quota-bearing sales. And so, you will continue to see us invest in those critical areas for us, and that's been something that we've been doing for quarters now. And so, we'll continue to add the quota-bearing sales, the direct sales folks, as we enter into '24. You could expect to see similar levels of growth as we enter the following year. So feel really good about where we've been investing in those same areas that we've been talking about. Quota-bearing direct sales heads as well as critical key engineering as we think about the great innovation that comes from our R&D and engineering teams across the world.\nBrad Sills: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great, thanks. I appreciate you taking the question and fantastic job with the Q3 results. Gina, you gave us some 2024 mile-markers at the Analyst Day earlier this year. It's now October, a lot's changed, but the growth profile is proven impressively durable throughout. Is there anything you're seeing that's meaningfully different here today versus where things were in May? It sounds more clear in terms of some initial value you're seeing from the GenAI capabilities, but there are there other swing factors we should keep in mind understanding Q4 is very important, but anything you can add is useful. Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah, you know, Michael, thanks for the question. We don't provide formal fiscal year guidance until next quarter. That said, given our increase in revenue this year, we remain ever confident in the goal that we put forth back in May at Analyst Day for 2024 as well as 2026. The strength of our underlying business does provide solid momentum, and the potential for upside heading into '24, but as you said, Q4 is a big quarter for us. We expect great things, but it has a significant impact on next year. So, we'll wait for the formal guide, but feel very, very confident in the numbers that we laid out for you back in May, and stay tuned as we head into '24.\nMichael Turrin: Well said. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hey, Gina. I actually wanted to follow up on that. I had a different version of that question which is, just more precisely on GenAI when you gave -- when you gave the outlook at the time of the Analyst Day, there's, obviously, already a lot of discussion about AI with the products that have been rolled out, so when you gave the '24 targets, does that embed any potential impact from GenAI specifically, or was that something that was just on the horizon, or on the com that wasn't included, just for clarification. I've gotten that question a lot.\nGina Mastantuono: Sure. Yeah, Samad, great question. As you recall, at Analyst Day, we actually showed a lot of live demos of the work that we were doing around generative AI. We talked also about the fact that we're not jumping on this AI bandwagon, but we've been investing in AI for years and years and generative AI was part of that. So as you think about our roadmap and our plan, GenAI was part of that. Now, that being said, the interest, and the understanding, and the excitement about GenAI today versus back in May is extremely exciting to us. And so, if your question is, is there potential upside as a result of GenAI, absolutely, but one quarter does not a trend make. So we will absolutely continue to keep you posted on the adoption rate of our GenAI SKUs, but we are extremely excited about the pipeline build that we've seen already, and it's just been out for a very short amount of time. And yeah, so more to come on where GenAI goes for us, but rest assured, ServiceNow is going to be a winner in the GenAI space, and we're extremely excited about pipeline build, and where we are today.\nSamad Samana: Great, and Bill, if I could squeeze one in for you, you've talked about how much interest and buzz that's been generated, and how it's increased the velocity of conversations. When you think about your Board-level conversations, are you seeing that the budget that's being carved out for spend on GenAI, is that being taken away from other parts of the overall IT budget, or is that, hey, this is a strategic imperative, and we need to find the money, whether we're growing our IT budget or not? Just how are they thinking about that -- those dollars and where they're trying to grow?\nBill McDermott: Yeah, Samad, the CEOs all have Boards of Directors, and they don't want to show up without a GenAI plan. So, this is a CEO-level decision, and I think that is why we meet with so many CEOs and the C-Suite is now completely embedded in the ServiceNow go-to-market plan, and it's working beautifully. What they are doing is as follows. According to IDC, the IT budget this year would have been about 3.5% spend, and next year, it's expected to go to, instead of incrementally increasing 3.5%, which is your typical year, it's expected, according to IDC, to incrementally go up 7%, and that's the IT budget itself. What I believe is going to happen, and based upon the CEO discussion that I'm having, and also based on my own way of thinking, I would very much like to take the position of looking at the world through the customers' eyes, and on them, 7% may or may not get it done. I might look to G&A functions to further fuel this generative AI revolution because this is really about business transformation, and truly transforming the way you run your company, and it's not a nice-to-have IT project. I do think that is one of the -- interesting question you have because, I think it's one of the reasons why I have said repeatedly the IT strategy has become the business strategy because digital transformation is an end-to-end imperative now generative AI across platforms that matter, and is only a few and we are one of them is really to me, going to get a very nice tailwind investment in 2024 regardless of the macro.\nSamad Samana: Great. I really appreciate you guys taking my questions. Thank you.\nBill McDermott: My pleasure, Samad. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Samad.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\nDerrick Wood: Oh, great, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, either for Bill or CJ, but I was hoping you could expand on your new AI Lighthouse program with NVIDIA and Accenture. You guys announced this initiative a couple months ago. It'd be great just to get a bit more color on the undertakings around this program, and how these particular partners are helping to drive more kind of generative AI investments on the ServiceNow platform.\nBill McDermott: Yes, Derrick, you know, I'll start off, and then CJ can build on it. I'd like to first acknowledge NVIDIA, in particular, has been such a great partner, really taking their fantastic GPU technology, and then working hand-in-glove with them on fine-tuning these large language models, especially beginning in IT, but even more recognized that one of the great brands, and great companies the world is using ServiceNow, to transform their company on our platform with generative AI is such a complement. And so, I just want to say thank you, Jensen. Thank you, NVIDIA, for being a great partner. And yes, with regards to Accenture, and Julie and so forth, we are really doing some great things with Accenture. They are a fantastic partner, and we're building now generative AI use cases across 300 different customers with our ecosystem, and that doesn't even touch on the broader pipeline. CJ can give you some detail on exactly what we're doing, but I really do want to say that, I am incredibly appreciative of our partners, and I want to thank our partners for recognizing that we're a good partner, and it takes a good partner to know one, and we have really built foundational trust with the ecosystem and I appreciate them all, and I think that is another tailwind effect that we're getting because I believe we're moving into a world of not just intra-enterprise, but inter-enterprise business network opportunities, and I believe our platform in generative AI will fuel a completely new frontier of solutions, and offerings, and the global economy, and I think that this is only just begun. I just want to really give you that as a thought because we'll have more to say about that in the future. CJ?\nCJ Desai: Absolutely, Bill. Right on. And, Derrick, you know, one of the things with this Lighthouse program that we were solving for is, have a great technology partner, and Jensen and the team are a great technology partner. Most of the -- most of us know NVIDIA as a great GPU provider among other engineered systems. But in this specific program, what most do not know is that NVIDIA's software team is working very closely with ServiceNow's engineering team, to really innovate on generative AI, and that is a very important point as part of this Lighthouse program is the engineering collaboration between NVIDIA and ServiceNow and a software layer, which, obviously, that pushes the hardware in the right direction. And then, when these customers, we talked about the four customers, there have been many, who start using this product, as they need to get adopted, besides Accenture, there will be other partners that we are also training, enabling so that they can implement really, really fast the solutions that come out of ServiceNow. So overall, this is a holistic strategy, engineering collaboration, and as Bill said, ecosystem collaboration, so that we can deliver the value for our customers. Customers' demands are high on the value that we will deliver, and we need great set of brands, technology, and system integrators to deliver the craft.\nDerrick Wood: Thank you for that color.\nOperator: And we have time for one last question. We'll take that question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Oh, great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. CJ, a question for you. A lot's changed in the observability market with the Splunk proposed acquisition. I'm curious, could you give us a sense for your positioning in the cloud observability market? With Lightstep and other advancements there, how well-positioned do you feel to gain additional share there? Thank you.\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. So, you know, I would say observability is still fundamentally a big market. It's a big market that continues to grow. We started with Lightstep, and as you are aware that they provided a great solution for tracing, and with OTL as an OpenTelemetry, they had done some phenomenal work. Then we added the metrics capability, and just end of September we finally added logging capabilities. So now we feel that we have a full-blown cloud observability solution that we can take to the enterprise market, and we will compete head-on what the types of use cases, that we need to, with whoever we need to, and that's how I look at it. So, I'm optimistic. We have a lot of work to do. Finally, the product is there, full-blown cloud observability product between metrics, traces, and logging, we are ready to go. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

            "content": "Hey, Raimo, thank you so much, this is CJ, for the question. Great to hear from you. ITSM and ITOM which we define from a solution perspective as service operation is code of our core. So, as Bill outlined that we had very strong new logo business, and new logos that matter, where we almost always plan with ITSM and ITOM, and in general, we are seeing that ITSM continues to have expansion rates, whether it's via Pro SKUs, or just recently added Pro Plus, and with ITOM and our AIOps strategy, we continue to execute on not only the product roadmap, but how our customers are leveraging those innovations from visibility all the way to health in that digital real estate. Thanks. Absolutely. Thank you, Bill, and thanks for the question. So, we have one data point from the last week of September, which, I do not want to translate it to trend. However, we are having many, many conversations with some of the iconic companies, and public sector customers, around ServiceNow's generative AI offering. So when we launched in 2018 Q3 the Pro SKUs, that was a curve that followed over multiple quarters, now 20 quarters, and we know what that looks like. With Pro Plus, what I'm seeing is, it is no longer about the potential of generative AI, where they are questioning is generative AI good for us in context of ServiceNow platform, but the conversations have shifted to, hey, CJ, how long would be -- would it take for us to implement? Does our data strategy need to be aligned, and what about the security, et cetera. So the positive side of this is that we are seeing good demand, and on the cautionary side is, we will work with our customers. They are learning. Like Bill said, the four customers who leaned in and bought our products on the last day of the quarter, but as we move forward, we'll work with these customers, and as we get a couple of quarters under the belt, we will be able to tell you how this is looking versus Pro. So Pro Plus versus Pro. Bill, you said it well. Mark, the only thing, great to hear from you. The only thing I would add is the engineering collaboration is absolutely necessary, but not sufficient when it comes to go-to-market partnership and relationship we have, working with Microsoft. So, whether it's our financial services customers or healthcare or government customers, when they are trying to leverage ServiceNow, hey, where are my assets? Are my assets healthy? Are they secure? Whether they are running on-prem, or in Azure, we have the best-in class partnership with Microsoft and that is definitely being noticed by some of our largest, as well as mid-sized customers, and brand-new customers. Hey, Gregg. Thanks for the question. I'll take this question. I would say, just to summarize because we, in the Vancouver release, launched Now Assist for our four flagship product lines which is ITSM, HR, customer service, and Creator. So let's start with that, and those are all resonating whether our customers want text-to-code or text-to-workflow capabilities, or they want their employees to be more productive, or they want their IT staff or customer service agents to be more productive. So, depending on the customer, and what they solving for, all of them are resonating really well. So this was driven mainly on Pro Plus, but these were Pro customers, who also bought Pro Plus. So one example, one of the customers who did buy this on September 29th, specifically, said to me, hey, CJ, you know, we had the most successful ITSM roll-out. Now, we want to buy Pro Plus, and they're on ITSM Pro already, and we just want our employee experience to be great, versus another customer that Bill mentioned, they said, not only we want to solve for our employees, but also our end customers. So these four specific transactions were across the board, resulting in very strategic and significant wins. As we move forward, I would tell you that what is still resonating with our customers is the speed to value. This is not something where now large language models need to be fine-tuned for one customer at a time, and the way our engineering team has implemented this solution, I can tell you, Generative AI is probably one of the best, if not the best complement I have seen to ServiceNow platform, where you can use generative AI to look up something to summarize something, and then you take action via ServiceNow platform. Thanks. So, first of all, Kirk, thank you for the question. When we start, and you know, yesterday we had our Board of Directors meeting and similar question was asked, we're first prioritized on our core set of use case that cut across every single industry. We are very focused on that, we are ITSM customer service, HR, as well as our Creator offerings. As we look forward though, there are specific use cases within financial services or healthcare types of customers or even government. So, I'll give you an example. Some of our public sector customers, they asked us, hey, CJ and the team, can you provide us a solution, that can potentially run on-prem, given the nature of that agency, and our engineering team delivered that for our public sector customer. So, I would consider that as a vertical solution, that we had to create, for our public sector customers. But as we take it to the next level, post this core set of use cases across our four workflows, we will definitely be prioritizing financial services and TMT moving forward. Yeah, Alex, thanks for the question. This is CJ. First of all, you know, yes, Federal had a phenomenal quarter, and it's been talked about by both Bill and Gina, but we also saw strength in certain industries, and certain geographies across the board. We won't be able to produce these kind of results, and this kind of beat on cRPO with our strengths in other industries and other geographies. So that's what I would say at the highest level that there were a lot of other strengths, and even from a use case or a workflow perspective, Bill already outlined, that our employee workflow, which is now customers are asking us this question that we want our employee productivity to be high, and what is ServiceNow's solution because employees waste too much time swivel chairing or looking for information, so we saw significant growth there, but the growth was across the board, given from a workflow perspective as all four workflows grew very, very nicely. And Alex, you know, how much I pay attention to that. The second thing I would say on Pro and Pro Plus, what we are seeing is that customers understand ServiceNow strategy is very specific to ServiceNow use cases. And one of the things that I realized after having this Pro Plus conversations with customers on a large sample size that, generative AI or our Pro Plus SKU is a productivity multiplier. It's not a productivity enhancer. When you have a productivity multiplier, and you can articulate what kind of productivity gains they will get, that is when they say, okay, we got it. And now, let's forget what are the pricing, and other things. So, competitive dynamics wise, from a generative AI standpoint for overall this Pro Plus SKU, it is still in the context of ServiceNow. How much value will they get, how fast will they get that value, and how much they're willing to pay. Absolutely, Bill. Right on. And, Derrick, you know, one of the things with this Lighthouse program that we were solving for is, have a great technology partner, and Jensen and the team are a great technology partner. Most of the -- most of us know NVIDIA as a great GPU provider among other engineered systems. But in this specific program, what most do not know is that NVIDIA's software team is working very closely with ServiceNow's engineering team, to really innovate on generative AI, and that is a very important point as part of this Lighthouse program is the engineering collaboration between NVIDIA and ServiceNow and a software layer, which, obviously, that pushes the hardware in the right direction. And then, when these customers, we talked about the four customers, there have been many, who start using this product, as they need to get adopted, besides Accenture, there will be other partners that we are also training, enabling so that they can implement really, really fast the solutions that come out of ServiceNow. So overall, this is a holistic strategy, engineering collaboration, and as Bill said, ecosystem collaboration, so that we can deliver the value for our customers. Customers' demands are high on the value that we will deliver, and we need great set of brands, technology, and system integrators to deliver the craft. Absolutely. So, you know, I would say observability is still fundamentally a big market. It's a big market that continues to grow. We started with Lightstep, and as you are aware that they provided a great solution for tracing, and with OTL as an OpenTelemetry, they had done some phenomenal work. Then we added the metrics capability, and just end of September we finally added logging capabilities. So now we feel that we have a full-blown cloud observability solution that we can take to the enterprise market, and we will compete head-on what the types of use cases, that we need to, with whoever we need to, and that's how I look at it. So, I'm optimistic. We have a lot of work to do. Finally, the product is there, full-blown cloud observability product between metrics, traces, and logging, we are ready to go. Thank you, Matt."

            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and thank you everyone for joining us today. On behalf of Gina, CJ, and our entire company, I'd like to first make a brief statement about recent events. ServiceNow has a very special team in Israel. One of our own colleagues Shlomi Sividia was at the Supernova Music Festival. He was murdered in the unprecedented and heinous attack. Shlomi was highly respected, admired, and a good friend to many. We stand in solidarity with our team and with their families. Terrorism has caused the unfathomable humanitarian crisis and now engulfs millions of people in Israel and Gaza. Our hearts pray for the innocent on all sides. Even with optimism in short supply, we choose to honor the dream of a peaceful and prosperous future for the Middle East region. God bless and protect all those in harm's way. Now for business. Of course, that's the reason we're here to discuss ServiceNow's Q3 results. We're proud that our company once again delivered beyond expectation. ServiceNow has delivered subscription revenue that grew by 24.5% in constant currency, over one point above our guidance. cRPO grew a strong 24%. That's 2.5 points above our guidance. Operating margin was 30%, more than 2.5 points above our guidance. We had 83 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV, up from 69 a year ago, a 20% increase year-over-year. Our focus on landing the right new customers, continued to deliver. Large new logo growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. ServiceNow's traction as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation has intensified. All of our workflow businesses were in 14 or more of the top 20 deals, ITSM, ITOM, ITAM, security and risk, customer, employee, and creator. Within our technology workflows, security and risk had a very strong quarter, with 10 deals over 1 million. Employee workflows had a stellar quarter with seven deals over 1 million and one deal over 10 million. From an industry perspective, this was the best US Federal quarter in ServiceNow's history. NNACV was up over 75% year-over-year. US Federal agencies are standardizing on a single platform with a core set of end-to-end solutions. We had 19 federal deals over 1 million, including three deals over 10 million. Our top deal in the quarter, the United States Air Force was the third largest deal in the company's history. You'll hear from Gina that this performance has heightened our confidence for a strong Q4. We're increasing the full year guidance on the top line and the bottom line and here is the key takeaway. AI has strengthened the market dynamics for enterprise software. ServiceNow is the fastest-growing company in this market at relative scale. We have the highest rule of 50 plus across our peer set with the highest growth of any other large-cap software company. We are the best performing enterprise software company to IPO. This is a unique, highly differentiated company that is rewriting the benchmarks to be best-in-class in the SaaS industry. Looking beyond the quarterly results, while the world's challenges are sobering, the digitization imperative is stronger than ever. Gartner forecasts that $3 trillion will be spent on AI and GenAI between 2023 and 2027. GenAI represents 36% of AI spending overall. We believe every dollar of global GDP will be impacted by AI over the next several years. This isn't a hype cycle. It is a generational movement. In the last year, ServiceNow has doubled down on our AI investments. Our Vancouver release includes generative AI-powered Now Assist for every workflow. Others issued press releases. We released product. At ServiceNow, our strategy isn't about exuberance. It's about execution. We carefully laid the groundwork for success and talent and resources and technology. This investment is accelerating our already robust pipeline with customers lining up to be first-movers in this next wave of business transformation. The question we've been asked repeatedly, does AI drive growth? The definitive answer is, yes, it does. GenAI represents a tailwind of growth for ServiceNow. We have over 300 customers in our pipeline from every industry, every buying center and every stage of testing. Our GenAI SKU drove the highest number of customer requests for a pre-release product in our history. We launched Vancouver on September 29th. That left us one day in Q3 to sign deals, and we signed four large deals. A US government agency selected our premium SKU offerings, to be an early adopter of GenAI. Real estate leader, CBRE is harnessing generative AI with ServiceNow to deliver superior service to customers and employees, while reducing costs. NVIDIA is accelerating its own ServiceNow journey with generative AI. Among other leading companies, Teleperformance joined ServiceNow's AI Lighthouse program. They will collaborate on new generative AI use cases that boost productivity while increasing customer and employee satisfaction in key industries. We have a wide range of other customer wins in the quarter as well. FedEx is using ServiceNow to simplify their IT workflows, while building a universal employee portal to improve employee experience for a 0.5 million global employees. One of the world's largest automakers selected ServiceNow to help consolidate dozens of applications into a new modern platform to accelerate their push into the EV market. Philips, Mars, Bank of California, Cleveland Clinic, the US Department of Defense, Fujitsu, Asahi Mutual Insurance, and the State of California are among many others. We see a meaningful path for all customers to recognize value from generative AI, in the quarters to come. Our innovation velocity is very high. Pipeline is growing fast and capacity to execute is well proven and this is just the beginning. Looking holistically at our business, we see progress everywhere. We have an aspiration to significantly increase the percentage of net new revenue, sourced by our partners in the coming years. This is about partners making the ServiceNow platform the core of their emerging business models. One exciting example is our customer Trane Technologies. They are a global climate innovator, which recently announced plans to acquire ServiceNow partner Nuvolo. With Nuvolo, Trane Technologies can bring world-class digital solutions, engineered on the ServiceNow platform to their global customer base. This creates a flywheel effect to ServiceNow, more use cases, drive more workflow automation. And today, we're excited to share that Deloitte and ServiceNow announced an expansion to our alliance. Deloitte will become a pioneering partner, integrating our generative AI capabilities into their leading operate services globally. This addition underscores Deloitte's commitment to enhance performance with cross-industry solutions built on the ServiceNow platform. We're also scaling our ecosystem globally, with today's announcement of a co-investment in ANSR, a market leader in enabling companies to scale technology centers. Another area that we expect to fuel long-term sustainable growth is industry verticalization. Our product development roadmap is expanding with use cases and telecommunications, financial services, retail and the public sector. And beyond any one industry, we increasingly see both intra and inter-enterprise workflow opportunities on the ServiceNow platform. This new generation of business networks is creating value chains that transcend traditional business boundaries. Our rapid pace of workflow innovation creates an even greater demand for our training and skills initiative, RiseUp with ServiceNow. As one example, FutureSkills Prime, a digital skilling initiatives of the Indian government will train thousands of learners across India in new digital skills. This partnership offers clear pathways to build careers as businesses worldwide grow at ServiceNow workforce. Bottom line this all points to grow at ServiceNow. In closing, we are building a company for the ages, by concentrating on customer value, we are creating immense shareholder value. At a strategic level, we chose to set the bar high, to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. We have an inspired team that is committed to our exponential dream. A company is only as great as each member of the team and the team is only as great as the company. That is what culture is all about. Our employee engagement scores increased across the board this year, so did our retention rates, which are already best-in class. We never went for layoffs. We went for thoughtful, careful expansion. When you look at the ongoing momentum from Knowledge '23, it's clear the approach is working. A profitable growth profile of this company speaks for itself. The market is there for us and now we're focused on Q4, delivering a strong full year and a fast start in 2024 as well. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to your questions. Now, I'll turn it over to our outstanding CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Well, Kash, thank you. I think that's the reason why we've raised our guidance on top of an outstanding quarter like this because we have great confidence in the core business. All CEOs right now are either in a move to increase productivity because of the crosswinds that you referenced in the macro or take costs out. And obviously, while doing so, they also have the added challenge of new business model innovation, such as the auto industry, now dealing with the transition to EV. What's unique about ServiceNow is digital transformation can deflect so many of the cost, and hence the labor-intensive procedures that companies have to deal with to properly serve their market. On top of that, you have one-third of the productivity of knowledge workers getting torn apart by swivel chairing between on average 13 individual applications a day. Now you add the productivity tailwind of generative AI on this once-in-a-generation ServiceNow platform, and you have achieved a very important business transformation. And I think right now, CEOs are focused on business transformation, and when you can give them one common UX that is consumer-grade, that integrates with a half-a-century-old legacy mess that they have to contend with, and we can get the actions that they need done, done, done to achieve cost-out productivity and growth on, they're all about ServiceNow now, and that's why you're seeing these results, and they are sustainable. Thank you, Kash. Thanks. Well I can -- I can tell you that we, first of all, I appreciate your question, Keith. You know how well we have done with the Pro version of the platform and there's still plenty of room to expand on that, but the demand that we've seen so far for Pro Plus, and the transformational nature of what customers are now able to do on the Now Platform has led to the single best type that we have seen at ServiceNow. I'll let CJ give you some color on individual customers and some of the actual stories that, I think, you'll find illuminating. And Keith, one thing to keep in mind is Pro is the necessary stepping stone to Pro Plus. So, from a shareholder value creation standpoint, it's plus-plus. Thank you very much, Keith. Yes. John, I'll start off and then let Gina give you some of her color as well. But our federal business, as I said, had the biggest quarter in ServiceNow's history with 75% year-over-year growth in NNACV, and we had 19 deals that were more than 1 million, including three over 10 million with the US Air Force as the third biggest deal in the history of ServiceNow. And what we're seeing is across all areas, federal agencies are really looking to consolidate contracts, point solutions, the messy middle, and they really want to standardize on a platform with a core set of products that they can grow with. And our GenAI offerings, for example, are really reinforcing our ability to help accelerate their transformation journey, and they're seeing really tremendous opportunity in GenAI on our platform. And we're already seeing early adopters show an interest in domain-specific models, which offer better security, as CJ said, and we're working with some agencies that I can tell care a lot about security. So I think it's really a tribute to ServiceNow's engineering and the way ServiceNow runs our cloud and the manner in which we care for our customers at a deep technical level and they know that they can count on that. And every agency where we've done business is highly referenceable and they're telling our story to other agencies for us. It's really a beautiful force multiplying situation. But I want to leave you with one thought. We're only getting started. With federal, with state, with local, the business transformation that's going to go on in the next decade across all of those categories will play beautifully into our growth agenda, and we'll continue to service it with 100% customer satisfaction. We are fired up with what we're able to do to transform government and make it run like a best run business. Thank you, John. Yeah. I'll start off, and then please, CJ, feel free to add your opinion on this as well, but our partnership with Microsoft is really geared to open additional addressable market for ServiceNow. And we're doing that by creating and expanding co-sell motion with Microsoft's enterprise sales teams. So that would talk to one-two punch, and ServiceNow is really helping streamline their migrations to Azure, while Azure exposes us to a much wider spectrum of customers. So we saw the partnership influence deals across geos in Q3, including government wins in Americas, and APAC as real driving forces between both Microsoft and ServiceNow. And we really are confident that the partnership, and the synergy with Microsoft does enable us to bring value to more customers, and do so at an unprecedented speed, and I do want to say, that we've been friends, with Satya and myself on a personal level for a long time, and we've done a lot of business together, and the friendship that exists with CJ and the engineering team at Microsoft is very rock-solid, and we trust each other, and we see that our mutual interest is better by working together, but also, we're doing it in the name of the customer. And I think that's the big thing. And I just want to complement CJ and our engineering team, not just for the 5,00 new innovations they brought to the platform this year, that would have been enough, but also for the hands-on relationship with great partners like Microsoft because you got to remember, everything we have has been integrated into Microsoft, from Office 365, to Dynamics, to Teams, to Azure, to AIOps, it's pretty -- pretty amazing when you think about the engineering work and talent that went into putting this together. So this isn't just by let's go to market and two is better than one. This is deep technical integration to serve customers at an unprecedented level. Thank you very much, Mark. And, Alex, if I may build on what CJ said, I can give you some additional color, if you like. One thing that might be of interest to you is in Americas, the number of $5 million plus deals actually more than quadrupled year-over-year, and the number of $10 million plus deal doubled year-over-year, and I think as CJ laid out beautifully, technology and employee workflows were enormously successful. And in EMEA, our 1 million plus deals grew 70% year-over-year now, which means that the platform and multiple components of the solutions that our great engineering team builds is resonating, and we're seeing particular uplift now in government and manufacturing. And one interesting fact. We have these world forums coming up in London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Rotterdam, and we have 1 billion plus pipeline that's registered for those events. So, we feel good about that. And APJ, when you think about it, 1 million plus deals increased 40% year-over-year, and Japan is continuing to impress us with the unprecedented opportunity of the world's third-largest economy as Germany is as well. So, we're seeing lots of real growth opportunities on the global stage, and I think Gina pointed that out earlier as well. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. Yeah, Samad, the CEOs all have Boards of Directors, and they don't want to show up without a GenAI plan. So, this is a CEO-level decision, and I think that is why we meet with so many CEOs and the C-Suite is now completely embedded in the ServiceNow go-to-market plan, and it's working beautifully. What they are doing is as follows. According to IDC, the IT budget this year would have been about 3.5% spend, and next year, it's expected to go to, instead of incrementally increasing 3.5%, which is your typical year, it's expected, according to IDC, to incrementally go up 7%, and that's the IT budget itself. What I believe is going to happen, and based upon the CEO discussion that I'm having, and also based on my own way of thinking, I would very much like to take the position of looking at the world through the customers' eyes, and on them, 7% may or may not get it done. I might look to G&A functions to further fuel this generative AI revolution because this is really about business transformation, and truly transforming the way you run your company, and it's not a nice-to-have IT project. I do think that is one of the -- interesting question you have because, I think it's one of the reasons why I have said repeatedly the IT strategy has become the business strategy because digital transformation is an end-to-end imperative now generative AI across platforms that matter, and is only a few and we are one of them is really to me, going to get a very nice tailwind investment in 2024 regardless of the macro. My pleasure, Samad. Thank you. Yes, Derrick, you know, I'll start off, and then CJ can build on it. I'd like to first acknowledge NVIDIA, in particular, has been such a great partner, really taking their fantastic GPU technology, and then working hand-in-glove with them on fine-tuning these large language models, especially beginning in IT, but even more recognized that one of the great brands, and great companies the world is using ServiceNow, to transform their company on our platform with generative AI is such a complement. And so, I just want to say thank you, Jensen. Thank you, NVIDIA, for being a great partner. And yes, with regards to Accenture, and Julie and so forth, we are really doing some great things with Accenture. They are a fantastic partner, and we're building now generative AI use cases across 300 different customers with our ecosystem, and that doesn't even touch on the broader pipeline. CJ can give you some detail on exactly what we're doing, but I really do want to say that, I am incredibly appreciative of our partners, and I want to thank our partners for recognizing that we're a good partner, and it takes a good partner to know one, and we have really built foundational trust with the ecosystem and I appreciate them all, and I think that is another tailwind effect that we're getting because I believe we're moving into a world of not just intra-enterprise, but inter-enterprise business network opportunities, and I believe our platform in generative AI will fuel a completely new frontier of solutions, and offerings, and the global economy, and I think that this is only just begun. I just want to really give you that as a thought because we'll have more to say about that in the future. CJ?"

            "name": "Gina Mastantuono",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q3 marks another quarter of strong execution, as we once again significantly surpassed the high end of our topline growth and profitability guidance metrics. ServiceNow continues to demonstrate its resilience as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. Customers are seeking enhanced productivity solutions in the current macroenvironment and ServiceNow is delivering. In Q3, subscription revenues of $2.216 billion, growing 24.5% year-over-year in constant-currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by over 100 basis points, amazing organic growth at massive scale. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14.4 billion, representing 23.5% year-over-year constant-currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.43 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant-currency growth, and a 250 basis point beat versus our guidance. As Bill highlighted, Federal has best net new ACV quarter ever, growing over 75% year-over-year. I want to give a quick shout out to the Federal team, who has just been crushing it. Among the other industries, transportation and logistics was very strong, growing over a 100% year-over-year, followed by education, which grew over 75%. Manufacturing and CMC also saw robust growth. We had some outstanding achievements from a workflow standpoint as well. I'm pleased to announce that Creator Workflows crossed 1 billion in ACV in Q3, a monumental milestone, and our Employee Pro SKU saw over 100% growth in net new ACV year-over-year. Retention remained exceptional with the renewal rate of 98% in Q3 reaffirming the essential role the Now Platform plays in our customers' operations. Our customer cohorts displayed solid expansion as the quarter closed with 1,789 customers contributing over 1 million in ACV, with 58% year-over-year growth in those contributing over $20 million. In Q3, we successfully closed 83 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV, with four deals greater than 10 million. Notably, 18 of our top 20 net new ACV deals included eight or more products. By launching at the end of the quarter we have already -- we have also already closed four GenAI-related enterprise deals and we're seeing strong pipeline build for our plus SKUs. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, over 250 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management, and the top-line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 9%, up 300 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7 billion in cash and investments. In Q3 we repurchased, 0.5 million shares as part of our first-ever share repurchase program, with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. We are raising the full-year outlook to reflect the strength of Q3. As we have done all year, we continue to prudently factor the macro cross-wins into our guidance. This includes incremental FX headwind from a strengthening US dollar. For 2023, we are raising our subscription revenues outlook by $48 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.635 billion to $8.640 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth or 25% on a constant-currency basis. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 26.5% to 27%. And we continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and GAAP-diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.320 billion and $2.325 billion, representing 24.5% to 25% year-over-year growth or 23% to 23.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20.5% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Notably, the strength of our federal business has resulted in a higher mix of 12-month contracts that will create a one point headwind to Q4 cRPO growth and remain a headwind into 2024. We expect that these contracts will renew in 2024 as ServiceNow's federal contract renewal rate are 99%. We expect an operating margin of 27.5% and we expect 206 million GAAP-diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, our team delivered an exceptional performance across the board. With a culture focused on customer success, our people have worked relentlessly to provide solutions to meet enterprise's needs, and it's showing in our robust results. Businesses are looking to consolidate vendors and standardize on a platform with a core set of products, so they can build a predictable and reliable roadmap to drive digital transformation. ServiceNow is that strategic platform. With the addition of our Vancouver release, and the capabilities presented by GenAI, the window of opportunity is even more expansive than ever before. The result is a more powerful, and intelligent platform, that enables customers to ignite end-to-end action, across the enterprise in ways not seen before. It's an exciting opportunity to further improve productivity, and employee satisfaction, optimize processes, reduce costs, and create organizational agility. The possibilities are endless. Bill and I extent our gratitude to all our employees worldwide for their unwavering dedication and commitment that puts us at the forefront of this opportunity, and further driving ServiceNow towards its ambition of becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. So, thanks. Tyler, thanks so much for the question. So yes, we're very excited. Q3 results were just phenomenal across the board, and the beat on constant-currency cRPO was two things, specifically strong net new ACV growth, and that was primarily driven, but not entirely, primarily, not entirely driven by very strong federal business, which was just fantastic and great business for us. We also did have better federal early renewals. If you remember, we've been really prudent in how we've been forecasting early renewals, given the current macroenvironment. And so the beat this quarter was two-pronged right. So strong net new ACV growth as well as strong early renewals. To your question on the impact of Q4 cRPO and the one point headwind, how Federal agencies usually contract is one year out, right. So their contracts are only 12 months in duration. So it doesn't have a negative impact on Q3, right, because at the end of Q3, you have it in their peripheral year. But at the end of Q4, with one quarter of those contracts roll-off cRPO, it means that there is a headwind to Q4 and because Q4, sorry, because Federal was so strong, and the mix of federal in Q3 was stronger than we've ever seen before, there is that headwind into Q4. But again, as you think about the underlying business, extremely strong results, in fact, Federal business has a strong renewal rate at 99%. So as you think about the underlying health of the business going into '24, it remains very strong. Thanks, Tyler. The only thing, I would add, and Bill, fantastic answer. The only thing, I would add, John, is that, this is durable demand. The Federal agency's digitization agenda is only growing, and the success that we've had at Federal, we absolutely have the ability to replicate that outside of the US and public sector around the world. Thanks, John. Yeah, it's a great question, Karl. Actually quarter-over quarter, year-over-year on-prem has remained consistent. So that hasn't been an impact and so the strength in our revenue in the quarter was the result of extremely fantastic execution by the team. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. Yeah. Brad, listen, this is a tale of continued execution. We've been very focused on adding heads and investing in our R&D resources, and our quota-bearing sales. And so, you will continue to see us invest in those critical areas for us, and that's been something that we've been doing for quarters now. And so, we'll continue to add the quota-bearing sales, the direct sales folks, as we enter into '24. You could expect to see similar levels of growth as we enter the following year. So feel really good about where we've been investing in those same areas that we've been talking about. Quota-bearing direct sales heads as well as critical key engineering as we think about the great innovation that comes from our R&D and engineering teams across the world. Yeah, you know, Michael, thanks for the question. We don't provide formal fiscal year guidance until next quarter. That said, given our increase in revenue this year, we remain ever confident in the goal that we put forth back in May at Analyst Day for 2024 as well as 2026. The strength of our underlying business does provide solid momentum, and the potential for upside heading into '24, but as you said, Q4 is a big quarter for us. We expect great things, but it has a significant impact on next year. So, we'll wait for the formal guide, but feel very, very confident in the numbers that we laid out for you back in May, and stay tuned as we head into '24. Thanks, Michael. Sure. Yeah, Samad, great question. As you recall, at Analyst Day, we actually showed a lot of live demos of the work that we were doing around generative AI. We talked also about the fact that we're not jumping on this AI bandwagon, but we've been investing in AI for years and years and generative AI was part of that. So as you think about our roadmap and our plan, GenAI was part of that. Now, that being said, the interest, and the understanding, and the excitement about GenAI today versus back in May is extremely exciting to us. And so, if your question is, is there potential upside as a result of GenAI, absolutely, but one quarter does not a trend make. So we will absolutely continue to keep you posted on the adoption rate of our GenAI SKUs, but we are extremely excited about the pipeline build that we've seen already, and it's just been out for a very short amount of time. And yeah, so more to come on where GenAI goes for us, but rest assured, ServiceNow is going to be a winner in the GenAI space, and we're extremely excited about pipeline build, and where we are today. Thanks, Samad."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDarren Yip: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining ServiceNow\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll review our second quarter 2023 results and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2023. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Once again, ServiceNow's Q2 results beat expectations for all key performance metrics. Subscription revenue grew 25% in constant currency, 1% above the high-end of our guidance. CRPO grew 24% in constant currency, 1.5% above our guidance, and operating margin was 25%, 2 points above our guidance. We had 70 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, which was up from 54 a year ago or a 30% increase. As the market consolidates, customers are moving to ServiceNow as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. We have now more than 1 trillion workflows running through ServiceNow each year, and that metric is already growing at 40% annually. ServiceNow's long-term trajectory is being supercharged by Generative AI. ServiceNow is the most differentiated asset in enterprise software, AI first mover, organic innovation-led, fast top line growth, best-in-class profitability, 99% renewal rate, early stages of cross-sell expansion around our IT mode. We have said consistently, ServiceNow will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. This Q2 beat and raise is another step forward on that journey. Looking at our solutions portfolio, large deals were evenly spread in Q2, which illustrates the broad appeal of this platform. ITSM was in 16 of the top 20 deals with seven deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 13 of the top 20, also with seven deals over $1 million. Together, security and risk combined for 17 of the top 20 with eight deals over $1 million. Customer workflows had a sensational quarter, its best net new ACV growth in three years. Customer was in 16 of the top 20 deals with eight deals over $1 million. Employee Workflows were in 14 of the top 20 with seven deals over $1 million, and Creator Workflows were in 18 of the top 20, with eight deals over $1 million. Great organizations are transforming with ServiceNow, including Barclays, BT, Honda, HP, Petrobras, CSB Bank in India and Yokohama City in Japan, to name a few. We see a sustained demand environment and pipeline for all of our product businesses, geographic regions and industry verticals. We're set up very well for a strong second-half. As you'll hear from Gina, we are raising our full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin. This is an unprecedented market environment for enterprise software. Our good friend, NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, joined us at Knowledge \u201823 earlier this year. And Jensen stated the expanded NVIDIA-ServiceNow partnership is really important. Their partnership of choice for enterprise IT. He thinks it's an exciting growth opportunity for both companies. We agree. We're in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%. When you correlate that to ServiceNow's platform and our workflow leadership, it's clear we live in a great neighborhood on a super nice street, and maybe we're in the best house. With regard to artificial intelligence, especially large language models, ServiceNow strategy has been laser-focused for years. We accelerated that focus with our Element AI acquisition in 2020. Today, by some estimates, Generative AI could boost global GDP by almost $7 trillion. We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they're careful to remind me, it's all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow's AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer's enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy. As you saw at our Financial Analyst Day, ServiceNow is infusing Generative AI into all of our workflow offerings. We have since announced, Now Assist for virtual agent, which maximizes productivity by eliminating time spent searching for information. Another example is ServiceNow Generative AI controller. It allows organizations to connect ServiceNow instances to Bolt, Microsoft Azure OpenAI service, and OpenAI API large language models. We're going even further by expanding our Generative AI capabilities with case summarization and text-to-code, text-to-flow and text-to-new-application-development. Our customers are so excited for greater ROI and customer service, better employee self-service experiences and a substantial boost in developer productivity. They are ready to invest to drive these outcomes. And based on the immense value our customers will realize from our Generative AI innovation, we have a clear strategy for monetization. First, our existing Pro offerings had a record quarter in Q2 based on the hyperautomation technologies we already engineered into those products. For all new Generative AI capabilities beginning with our Vancouver release, we will introduce a new set of premium plus SKU offerings across ITSM, CSM and HR SV. We have also introduced a new ServiceNow AI Lighthouse customer program, alongside NVIDIA and Accenture, all in lockstep to accelerate value realization at the cutting edge of Generative AI. Specifically, this involves our engineers locking arms with NVIDIAs to codevelop new use cases for the enterprise. We already have the most significant pharmaceutical, financial services, manufacturing and health care companies engage with us. Additional customers will become design partners for new AI capabilities in their specific industries. We're currently evaluating a range of customers who are candidates for this program, and the interest is continuing to surge. These engagements share one sentiment perfectly in common: The propensity to buy is there. Even as our underlying growth is already strong as our Q2 results indicate, AI represents a market-making tailwind to ServiceNow. Intelligence is only relevant when it is delivered where work actually gets done. It's why our single architecture, single data model workflow platform has never been more relevant than it is right now. As AI goes to work, humans will be the real machines, because in most cases, AI augments people, it doesn't replace them. At a moment when employers face a 17-year high in unfilled job openings, Generative AI will lift human productivity, so we can chase even bigger dreams for the global economy and for the world. With our integrated suite of automation technologies, including AI, RPA and process mining, ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to lead the intelligence revolution, and we will. Looking broadly at the state of our business, we have the momentum with our upcoming Vancouver release in September, our products and engineering team will deliver even more AI innovation. Our partner ecosystem has never been more invested than they are right now. We announced an expanded strategic partnership with Cognizant to accelerate adoption of AI-driven automation. We expanded our partnership with KPMG to co-develop joint offerings through our finance and supply chain workflows. We launched a new collaboration with Guidewire to improve insurance experiences. We're also seeing extensive third-party recognition of our products. ServiceNow has been recognized for AIOps, app engine and cloud observability by prominent industry analysts. From customer service to risk to employee experience and ERP simplification, we can go on and on. This has fueled our rise into the Fortune 500 for the first time. And this is another tribute to Fred Luddy's founding vision for a hungry and humble market-leading company, and we're only getting started. In closing, this is a dynamic period for the IT industry. Think about it this way. Every leader in every department, in every business, in every industry is writing a new playbook for the AI world. CEO's are sponsoring them. The C-suite across all functions is funding them. And for the few true platforms, the opportunity is bigger than ever. ServiceNow injects speed into the business architecture. Our platform has become the de facto standard for intelligent automation. We are a growth company. We are profitable and durable. And thanks to the relentless execution and results speak for themselves, we believe in our people, our culture, our platform and our partners. The world is changing. Imagination is the only limit. ServiceNow is on the move. A CEO I spoke to this summer summed things up perfectly. She said, and I \u201cEverywhere I go, people are talking about ServiceNow. Whatever you all are doing, it's working. \" That's one of the many reasons we proudly say now as ever, the world works with ServiceNow. Thank you all very much. I look forward to your questions. But first, let me turn it over to our great CFO, Gina?\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter for ServiceNow. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range for all of our key performance metrics, delivering robust subscription revenue and CRPO growth, while continuing to drive operating margin expansion and very healthy free cash flow. In Q2, subscription revenues were $2.08 billion, growing 25% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14.2 billion, representing 22.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.2 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, transportation and logistics led the way with over 80% growth in Q2, followed by a very strong growth in education, business and consumer services, energy and utilities and government. In fact, U.S. Federal had its best Q2 ever, continuing the trend of strong growth over the past several quarters. Our best-in-class renewal rate was 99% in Q2, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. With that foundation from which to grow, top line strength in the quarter was further driven by healthy expansion of our existing customers. We ended the quarter with 1,724 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, including 45 paying us over $20 million, a 55% increase year-over-year. The Better Together Story is continuing to resonate with C-suites driving larger multiproduct deals as enterprises are looking to consolidate purchasing with our strategic platforms like ServiceNow. In Q2, 19 of our top 20 deals contained five or more products, with nine of them containing 10 or more products. In addition to our cross sales, our upsell motion also remained very strong. ITSM Pro had its strongest growth quarter since 2020, driven by both upsells from the standard SKU and seed expansions from existing customers. Overall, we closed 70 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up from [54%] (ph) a year ago, representing 30% year-over-year growth. What's more, 12 of those deals were over $5 million, of which three were over $10 million. We also saw a strong performance from our industry SKUs, with our telco and technology SKUs closing six deals over $1 million in net new ACV, and our newly launched public sector SKU gaining further momentum and landing another seven-figure deal in the quarter. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by continued disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 21%. I would also note that given our path to sustained profitability, in Q2, we recorded a large GAAP income tax benefit, reflecting a $965 million valuation allowance release related to our deferred tax assets in the U.S. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7.5 billion in cash and investments. Given the current macro environment and our strong cash position in May, the Board of Directors authorized the company's first-ever share repurchase program. The new program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.5 billion of common stock. The program's primary objective is managing the impact of dilution. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our outlook. While we continue to prudently factor the evolving macro cross win into our guidance, our first half outperformance has driven strong momentum as we head into the back half of the year. As a result, we are raising our top line and operating margin guidance. For 2023, we are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $95 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.6 billion, representing 24.5% to 25% year-over-year growth or 24% on a constant currency basis. We are raising our full-year operating margin target from 26% to 26.5%. And we continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $2.185 billion and $2.195 billion, representing 25.5% to 26% year-over-year growth, or 23% to 23.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect CRPO growth of 25.5% or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 27%, and we expect 206 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, Q2 was another tremendous quarter of outstanding execution, and we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline remains strong as we've already seen $0.5 billion of pipeline generation from our Knowledge 2023 event in May. The week-long event of keynote, panels and customer discussions showcase the power and the endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflows along with the incremental opportunities unlocked with our Gen AI road map. Over $3 billion in pipeline attended with an over 50% increase in executive program attendees. The response has been overwhelming. Our intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation uniquely positions us to seize the opportunities in front of us as we continue to deliver durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st Century. Bill and I would also like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. It's their commitment to excellence, which has propelled ServiceNow into the Fortune 500, and we couldn't be proud of. This distinction is a testament to our win as a team of core value and a culmination of the outstanding results we passionately delivered together in service to our customers, partners and investors. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Mastantuono. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And really nice quarter. And what still we're going to stand is still not a super solid spending environment. So it definitely looks like ServiceNow is outperforming in that environment. I'm sure the focal point for a lot of investors though is going to be on sort of the Gen AI. You guys continue to innovate there. You continue to roll out new solutions. And I'm not sure if this is for Bill or Gina, but maybe you could help us, kind of, understand how we should be thinking about the time frame of -- we're going to see some releases in September. But how should we be thinking about the time frame of when this actually gets adopted by customers? And maybe more for Gina. When should we start to think about seeing actually like revenue contributions coming from these Gen AI solutions in the ServiceNow model?\nGina Mastantuono: Well, thank you, Keith, for all of those comments. I appreciate that. Vancouver launch is the end of September. So if you think about from a timing perspective, we won't see it even in the market really until Q4. I'll let CJ talk a little bit more about our very exciting Lighthouse program. But as we think about longer-term guidance, right, our scale is such that it's going to take a little while for us to see real impact on the top line, but rest assured, we absolutely are very bullish on the opportunities in front of us as we think about the value that we're creating for our customers with Gen AI.\nCJ Desai: Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Keith, for the question. And the way I would answer it in terms of the demand that we are seeing from some of the largest companies, some of them that were mentioned earlier from the industry perspective is very real. They believe that Generative AI, in context of ServiceNow, will deliver higher productivity. And I stay consistent that we are going to monetize only when we get higher value that are delivered for our customer and get a fraction of that value, whether it's 10%, 90% or whatever. So if a customer gets 100 points of value, ServiceNow keeps 10%, customer gets 90% of the value. What I mean here is our premium SKUs that Bill outlined will be Pro Plus. So this will be on top of ITSM Pro, CSM Pro, HRSV Pro with an exciting new offering for ServiceNow developers that we showcased at Knowledge, which will be text-to-code, text-to-workflow. These products are being released in September. We will see. We know how our adoption curve was for ITSM Pro and CSM Pro in 2019, so we have some models. But customers want to try it first, see the value, and then we will share with you at the next earnings on how things are going.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Nice job, guys.\nCJ Desai: Thank you, Keith.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Samad Samana at Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a strong quarter. I want to maybe ask a follow-up question. Gina you mentioned Vancouver is coming out at the end of September. I guess one of the questions I wanted to ask is, is it changing how customers are thinking about renewal timing? And I want to tie that to maybe the CRPO guidance that you just gave for the third quarter. How should we think about what you're thinking about the release, the new products and maybe how that informs the short-term guidance that you've just given for the third quarter and what that maybe implies for the fourth quarter as well as we've been through the rest of this year in particular.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, it's a great question, Samad. And what I'd say is, listen, at the end of the day, what you've seen quarter-after-quarter from ServiceNow is solid execution. The demand environment is very durable. And that being said, we continue to be prudent with our guidance, right? At the end of the day, we absolutely believe that Generative AI could potentially bring renewals forward, but I'm not baking that into a guide right now. We just don't know what that's going to look like. What I can tell you is that from a -- if you think about the Q3 guide versus last year, we have a full-year now of slower macro demand, right? So really Q3 is when things started to shift. The Q3 of last year had an incredible Q4 of \u201821 and an incredible Q1 of \u201822 in that CRPO guide. Our CRPO guide now for Q3 is strong. We are reflecting lower level of early renewals as we continue to see. But you're 100% right. The Generative AI potential and opportunity could absolutely have some upside that we've not reflected into our guide right now.\nSamad Samana: Great, thanks for that. Congrats again.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Samad.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Matt Hedberg at RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. I'll offer my congrats again, guys, on the strong quarter. Hearing seat expansion within ITSM Pro is great, especially when there is some investor questions about fewer IT developers in the Gen AI world. Could you put a little bit more context, I guess, a, on what drove that; and b, given the history Bill that you have, what are the long-term trends for developers in this Gen AI world? CJ, obviously, you can comment, but I think you got some perspective there as well.\nCJ Desai: Okay. So first of all, thanks, Matt, and I will start. As it was outlined that ITSM Pro, as well as CSM Pro, which are very similar, customer-facing agents and employee-facing agents, had amazing growth in second quarter. And even when I look at the percent of total, I feel very good about the Pro trajectory that we have been on in this market for the past few years based on automation and other features that we deliver via Pro. Now on your question on seat expansion, the way I think about it is T times Q times R, where R is the rate of increase. So if you look at ITSM Pro, what we have seen is besides the 25% uplift that Gina shared at the Financial Analyst Day, the seed expansion has been 10%. And so you may ask, okay, why is that? The reason is very simple, as the world is becoming more digitized, as the corporations are becoming more digitized, the incident volumes or a customer service requests are going up. So while they are leveraging the Pro features, the seed expansion is not a coincidence, because number of incidents, whether you look at security incidents, IT incidents, our digital products continue to go up. And that's why I look at T times Q times R where R being the rate of increase on the number of if you keep the quantity constant, that R is driven by higher level of digitization. So when I think about Generative AI specifically, we look at this base of Pro and we think about Pro Plus. And given the value that is already being delivered by Pro, Pro Plus will allow you to gain additional value or whether it's the employees, whether it's our customers' customers or whether it's our agents. And that's why we feel very comfortable with the monetization strategy with Pro Plus because our customers will get value because of higher productivity, and we'll get a small percent of it.\nBill McDermott: And Matt, what I would build on from CJ's commentary, is this is the entire enchilada as it relates to transforming businesses. Generative AI and these LLM models are now putting CEOs in a position where they have to come up with a new playbook. So if you're talking, for example, to a telco, media and technology CEO, they're thinking, how do I reinvent my customer service orientation, the offers that I'm making? How do I manage the network? How do I deliver great service operations? Similarly, you might be surprised a little bit to know how forward leaning the public sector is. They're thinking like self-service citizen experience. How do I really rethink citizen-facing assisted services? How do I drive employee productivity and really rethink the way we're running things? And manufacturing, I met with one CEO that for every minute, the shop floor is down or isn't as productive as it should be, every minute is $500,000. So that factory employee, the sourcing and supply chain, building a digital factory, how do I rethink sales and service. And health care, health care CEO who's running probably the most prestigious health care institution in the world said, how do I rethink health care and completely model something that doesn't exist today as it relates to the patient care and how I can move services from an in-house establishment to somebody's home. Like it's all on the table. So the point that I want to make is this. ServiceNow is now in all of those conversations. And many of those you might have thought of as, wow, that sounds like ERP modernization, or probably sounds like a supply chain case or a manufacturing case. So actually, that's the point. We have become the intelligent enterprise for digital transformation, and we're lifting people out of soul-crushing work and modernizing these companies with a 21st Century platform that's resonating. You combine that with LLMs, the combination of NVIDIA and others, I really think this is a once-in-a-generation moment.\nMatt Hedberg: Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Mark Murphy at JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you. I'll add my congrats. Bill, it sounds like you generated real pipeline coming out of the conference last month. Can you comment on the trend in business confidence and willingness to invest? In particular, is the exit velocity coming out of June and July turning a corner, if you think -- if you compare to how it felt coming out of April and March? And I'm also just curious, is there more consistency in the U.S. or Europe and Asia at the moment?\nBill McDermott: Well, thank you very much for the question, Mark. First of all, when we get to the C-level, and we're talking to the corner office, it's all about innovation. And there is no lack of interest in digital transformation. There is no lack of interest in rethinking the employee or the customer experience or even how you empower people to do their best work, especially engineers and IT professionals because the digital strategy has become the business strategy. So the whole thing for us is not so much based on one month or one quarter versus another. It's having a chance to portray the broad vision and the completeness of vision we have with C-level decision-makers that understand what transformation really is all about. So that is the only limiting factor just making sure we get a chance to explain the breadth and depth of our story. In terms of the geographic scenario, we're growing in all of them very well. They each have their own individual scenarios. Obviously, you're well aware of energy and security and obviously, the Ukrainian situation, which is just a human tragedy. Americas is extremely strong. Europe is strong in spite of that because they need technology to dig their way out of a lot of the complexity. And Asia is going well for us, especially in Japan, where we have a new leader now, and we really feel like we planted a flag in Japan, and we have a new frontier that's going to grow really fast. So we're feeling good about all the geos. Some of the industries are doing incredible things. And yet at the same time, I want to make the point back to the platform. We had 19 of our top 20 deals with five or more products in the deal bomb. And in nine of the deals, we had 10 or more products. And that's a tribute to CJ and an amazing engineering team, but also in concert with Paul and our go-to-market machine, the collaboration on taking innovation from the factory and getting it in the hands of the customer quickly is really establishing itself as an art form here. And I'm super proud of the team, and I just want to give it up for the team.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Mark.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: We'll go next now to John DiFucci at Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks for taking my -- hi Gina, how are you? Thanks for taking my question. So Gina, you said the Fed vertical or the U.S. Fed had its best quarter ever, which is really interesting. I guess, just a little more color on that. Were you referring to new ACV? And if so, whatever you can share with us, like a rough gauge of that? Like how much it grew maybe or anything that you can share further on that?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So John, what I said was that it had its best Q2 ever. And so Q3, as you know, is always a big quarter for Fed. But what I said was continuing the trend. So it had its best Q1 ever. It had its best Q2 ever. It had it best Q4 as well. And so it's not bigger than Q3, but it had a great quarter. It saw $10 million deals, including one over $8 million. And what you're really seeing is that our message around accelerating digital transformation journey is resonating. If you think about what they're looking to really partner with ServiceNow and platforms like ServiceNow, much more through an enterprise lens, more strategic, more multiyear, and they're really looking to digitally transform the citizen experience across the board. And so we're really excited about the continued trends that we're seeing. We have an incredible new leader in Dr. Raj Iyer doing incredible work with that whole team. And so you can only imagine that the opportunity remains really strong.\nBill McDermott: And if I could just build one thing on Gina's commentary, John. You might remember the great Kevin Haverty that ran all of our sales force for double-digit years. Kevin, is not only with us, but he oversees the whole government business as an entity for the corporation, and we see amazing opportunities to take what we have done in U.S. federal also state and local, don't forget, 40 out of the 50 states here run in ServiceNow. We see a great opportunity to take that to Asia, specifically India and Japan, obviously, across Europe, Germany, France, the U.K., to name a few, and we also see expansive opportunities in the Middle East. And I just want to shout out to Kevin because him being here and being a part of our future, and also mentoring Raj and really building a powerhouse is just so exciting to me personally. And I love the Fed team, and I just want to give them a little shout out, too, because they're amazing.\nJohn DiFucci: Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Gina. And nice job. Nice job, Kevin.\nBill McDermott: Yes, thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, John.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Rob Owens at Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great, thank you for taking my question. And I know there's been a lot of discussion around pipeline and enthusiasm towards the second half, but I just want to drill down, I guess, more from an economic standpoint. There's been a lot of discussion, I guess, around the edges here. But as you look at the second-half, willingness to invest from customers, and obviously, ServiceNow is taking share and executing this environment. But do you think that there's an all clear signal here that you're giving us with the strength in this quarter? I just want you to paint the landscape for us. Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I would not say that we're giving you an all clear sign on the economy, right? I think we continue to execute extremely well, but from a macro perspective, I would say that there's not a whole lot of change, except for the commentary on Gen AI, right? So everyone is really excited about the productivity gains and the value that Gen AI is going to create for the business. What that means for the back half is, I believe, it's early to tell. But at the end of the day, what I'll tell you is our pipeline remains healthy, and we actually see higher pipeline coverage ratios going into Q3 than we saw last year. A lot of momentum coming out of Knowledge \u201823. I talked about in my script, over $3 billion in pipeline attended that Knowledge Conference, and we saw a 50% increase in the executive program attending. So if you think of the C-suite, the higher-up folks are coming to understand what ServiceNow can do and provide. And so we've created approximately $0.5 billion in pipeline to-date out of that event. And we continue to see strong demand for our team to fly out and do demos, similar to what we presented at K23, especially around Gen AI. And so I'd be cautious, like there's not a whole lot of change in the macro, but there's a lot of excitement about what Gen AI, and in particular, with ServiceNow's Gen AI strategy can do for customers in the short, mid and long-term.\nBill McDermott: And one set of facts, Rob, that might be interesting to you and others is the loyalty effect. You understand cloud economics, of course, but there's also the human effect of loyalty. Right now, we took a very strong position with our employees that we would remain a loyal to them, no matter the weather conditions in the marketplace, that we would do it together. And we now have the best retention rates in the history of the company. We have 99% retention rate with our customers. So if you take the loyalty effect into consideration, the net present value of what that means, and you combine it with the net new ACV that we think we can get out of this amazing platform and the innovators that are leading the charge for us, we have a tremendous sense of purpose and confidence within the company. And I think that really is fun to watch, and it's pretty thrilling to see what we can do with our customers. And I'm excited about this brave new world. And we're really fired up and ready to go over here.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for the fine points around the topic.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. One for you, Bill and one for CJ. And Gina, we'll get to you on the follow-up calls. Bill, when you look at the last 12 months, challenging time for the economy, but ServiceNow out-executed gain share. So when the cycle turns towards being more constructive. What does ServiceNow pricing power look like? And how do you get value for your Generative AI investments and gain share of the precious IT budget? And one for you, CJ. You talked about $100 of value and how you keep 10. Why not more than 10? And could you tell us how the customer gets that $90 of value? I mean I'm sure that you've done some process mapping, some fancy map financials, et cetera. Just curious to get your thoughts. Thank you so much and congrats once again.\nBill McDermott: Yes, Kash, Thank you so much for the question. First of all, the pricing power in a technology company is always representative of its innovation. And again, I can't thank the leaders from CJ all the way through the engineering organization of this company for their great leadership. And I believe strongly, we have something you can reference that's quite fact-based. We have already introduced AI into the ServiceNow platform for some time, as CJ said. And we're seeing the Pro version of the ServiceNow platform grow more than 50%, 5-0 percent, year-on-year. And in terms of putting a figure on it, with Pro Plus, where we are building those LLM models into the ServiceNow platform and extending those partnerships, I'll let CJ talk about what we think we can get, but it is on top, and it is pretty significant because the business cases for the customers are so compelling.\nCJ Desai: Yes, thank you, Bill, and spot on. So Kash, we have always thought about pricing of services in the context of what value our customers get, whether when we launched ITSM Pro, which was exactly five years ago, and we have kept the same price for ITSM Pro over the past five years. Now in terms of Pro Plus, based on very specific use cases, right? So I'll start with specific use cases, which we call domain specific. Those large language models we do not need to run super large language models because we are saying that, hey, for ITSM, this model will give additional productivity on top of Pro. And that productivity based on the use case could be significant. So from a pricing perspective, on the list price, we would like to be at least minimum, 60% plus when we start on top of Pro. So you're a Pro customer, you're already getting the value. We have seen it over the past five years, and we have seen the seat expansion happen as well. So on Pro Plus, you start with 60% plus. Customers are trying out this large language models. The models have accuracy, they are trying to learn themselves. Hey, do I take the prediction that comes out of large language model? Do I just accept it? But we fundamentally believe, which is what I shared at the Financial Analyst Day, that Generative AI is a tailwind for our business, but most importantly, the value that customers get. So I want to start with explaining the value, because you can say somebody is more productive for a particular task that they are repeating over and over again, but what percent of their day they spend on the task. And how do we look at the particular work week or a customer service agent or an IT agent. And then if we can say, okay, for your industry, for these use cases on ServiceNow, we believe we can deliver very high value, and hence, there is a premium we have Pro Plus. And we'll start with the 10%, 90% map. And as we see more and more value getting delivered, of course, we are going to ask for higher prices.\nKash Rangan: Very lucid. Thank you so much. Congrats again.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Kash.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: We'll go next now to [Steve] (ph) Bachman at BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, it\u2019s Keith Bachman. I wanted to follow-up on that. Just a clarification. In the past, you've had ITSM Pro and Enterprise. Will there still be an Enterprise? Or does the Pro Plus subsume that in some way? And then the question is, at the analyst event that you had, we talked a lot about as Gen AI rolls out, you're not sure what the seat may -- seat count may impact, too. But in the Lighthouse program, I just wondered if you've got any perspective from any customers as they're thinking about rolling out Gen AI solutions where you've had additional thoughts or feedback on how that may increase the seat count. I know, CJ, you said what the seat count has been doing. So I'm really asking on a prospective basis, what seat count may do as you roll out these Gen AI solutions for ITSM, CSM, HR, et cetera?\nCJ Desai: Absolutely. So first of all, thank you, Keith. Lots of questions in there. And I would say when we launched ITSM Pro in September 2018, the exact same question was asked. And at that point, I said, okay, listen, if -- even if Q remains the same, with the 50% on the list price uplift, we should be able to deliver value for our customers. And how it has played out, though, is that not only we have been able to get 25% uplift on ITSM Pro, but in addition, the seat count went up by 10%, which is the rate of increase. Now when I look at Generative AI, to answer your first question, not only is Pro Plus, because it's also Enterprise Plus. Because Enterprise features are things like process mining, workforce optimization, skills mapping for the workforce in IT or customer service. So these are not related to AI feature set. So enterprise has a very different payload than Pro. So we are Pro Plus as well as Enterprise Plus. So that's number one. And number two, in your question around early customer conversations, customers are still dealing with labor shortage. They are still trying to figure out how they can make their labor force more productive. It is always about efficiency so they can get more work done. And in that environment, I have formed belief right now that Generative AI is a catalyst so that their employee base is still more productive. And so even if Q remains the same, I'm still optimistic on the rate of increase, as well as the price we will get because of the value we are going to deliver.\nKeith Bachman: Okay, many thanks.\nBill McDermott: Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next now to Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I think a lot of us are kind of taken aback by some of the pricing commentary on Pro Plus. So I wanted to maybe -- I had other questions, but I'll throw them to the side. I guess as we think about the potential for that type of uplift, can you walk us through, specifically, is this more going to come from a fee increase? Is it more of a consumption dynamic? Is there any thoughts about the percentage of adopting aspirationally you anticipate throughout your client base? And finally, from an investment perspective, is there a big CapEx cycle required? You mentioned the intensity of the models might not be needed to be foundational models in every case. So just can you contextualize some of those points?\nCJ Desai: Yes, absolutely, Alex. So I'm going to have Gina answer the CapEx and COGS question, and then I'll answer your pricing question.\nGina Mastantuono: So from a CapEx perspective, Alex, baked into our margin guide for this year, I'm not concerned, right? So any incremental demand is reflected in the free cash flow for 2023. As we think about going forward, at this point, we don't see any large requirements for increases. But as we see where demand kind of starts coming through in Q3 and Q4, the back half of the year, I'll reflect that in my guide for 2024. But rest assured, as you have known us to always do, if there is some pressure on gross margins as a result of a little bit more CapEx, we'll be offsetting that with operational efficiencies as we continue to roll out Gen AI capabilities within our own organization.\nCJ Desai: Got it. So Alex, the two things that I do want to share based on Gina's comments is, number one, we do not require large language model with hundreds of billions of parameters because for our domain specific use case, we can run what we have seen with text-to-code, for example, is one-tenth per size of OpenAI model. So that allows us to run it efficiently. It allows us to run while respecting the privacy of our customers' data. So that's number one, and that goes into the COGS answer that Gina gave based on the initial demand and customers that we are working with. Now in terms of your question around P times Q. The uplift that we believe we can absolutely price it as would be on the price. So if the quantity remains the same, the uplift will be on top of Pro with the list price, 60% uplift. And then, of course, our sales team works with enterprise discounts, all that you know how that plays out. And that's why if you assume that, why is that 60% is the number? It is all based on the value that we believe our customers will derive with additional Gen AI features that we are going to release for ITSM or whether it's for customer service management, those things, definitely, there is a cost of R&D and as well as cost to run something like that, but it will always be based on the value they get. So I feel pretty comfortable on the uplift list price on that specific price at the seat level. And then the second thing I would say is that we have seen, because of digitization on ITSM Pro, which was the point I was trying to make earlier, the seats have expanded by 10% over the last five years, while the price uplift that we have realized, which was 50% on top of ITSM, and we got 25%.\nBill McDermott: And Alex, one thing I would also like you to know and everybody else is we're getting a lot of new logos. And every time you get a new logo, you get new seats. The other thing is on the platform expansion in the company, we are now in a world where we're selling multi-product solutions, business solutions, to significant companies and industries, and we're communicating with all the personas. So one data point that you might find interesting is that 19 of the top 20 deals this quarter, there was five or more products in there. That's a lot of seats. In nine of our deals, there was 10 or more products in the deal. And then finally, if you think about large-scale enterprise deals, we are growing our deals in the $20-plus million category 50% year-on-year. So we're getting a lot of new seats. And I think that is something that you should always keep in mind. New logos, expanding on the platform in every company, going into new geos, and new personas, all new seats. And then if you apply the logic of innovation and pricing, as CJ said, you're going to get a lot of good outcomes for the customer and for the shareholders.\nAlex Zukin: Sounds like a pretty good recipe for success, guys. Congrats.\nBill McDermott: Thank you, Alex.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Karl Kierstead at UBS.\nKarl Kierstead: Thank you. Hey Gina, three months ago, you guys put up a solid quarter, but you did tell us that the FINS vertical, which is one of your largest, felt a little wobblier. Macro uncertainty picked up. Do you mind just giving us an update with the passage of three months, how that vertical tracked for ServiceNow in the quarter and how it might through year-end? Thanks so much.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. We -- so if you remember, I talked about the fact that we actually, in Q1, despite the macro stuff going on within that industry, we saw growth in Q1, and that was cycling huge growth in Q1 of 2022. And so we were really pleased with what we saw in Q1. And I would say we continue to see strength in financial services, and we had good growth in there and actually very good as we talked about deals with Barclays, for example. And so we continue to be demonstrating really strong value in all our financial services customers. So continued strength their costs.\nCJ Desai: Yes. And I'll just add one thing, Karl, on Gina's point, is that specifically in Q2, within Fin in the banking sector, we saw measurable progress across our portfolio, both in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe. So the platform is resonating. The largest of the largest bank expanded. And I can tell you that one bank, which expanded with us, is now close to -- at a TCV level, $100 million when they renewed with us in Q2. So we are seeing that banks are back, and there is a very decent pipeline in the second-half as well.\nKarl Kierstead: Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Peter Weed at AllianceBernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. I think one of the areas you've been emphasizing as kind of a future growth lever has been the ramping up of channel and its ability to really deliver alongside ServiceNow. And in the past, you've talked maybe 15%, 20% of revenue is kind of really channel directed and more was supported. How is that going? And how large do you see that getting to over the coming year? And is this something that you might start breaking out, something that you might speak about regularly in your earnings going forward?\nBill McDermott: Yes, it's a good question, Peter. One of the things that I would just share with the group here is we have really, really great partnerships. And I mentioned the Cognizant partnership, they're accelerating their adoption of AI-driven automation with us and taking that to market. KPMG, reimagining finance, supply chain and procurement. We talked a little bit about Accenture. They're the first mover in joining the ServiceNow customer Lighthouse program. But we also have other channel partners that are developing giving our sales force expanded reach, very large technology companies and reporting on that might be worth doing in the future, certainly wouldn't be against it. But you're right, that a lot of the technology partners, whether they're hyperscalers, they're part of the technology stack or they're just strong technology companies, they recognize the power of their solutions when you combine it with workflow automation from ServiceNow, because then instead of selling boxes or products in a SKU, they move into business solutions. And then they can customize that story by industry. And we're even having some situation in the channel where we're developing smaller bite-sized turnkey solutions that can be sold in a virtual world. So we can do a lot with the channel. I think it's early days for those technology channel partners. The SIs have all adopted us. All have now -- the big ones all have billion-plus practices. One is beyond $5 billion. So you're on a good point, and we'll be sure to talk about that a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Brad Sills of Bank of America.\nBrad Sills: Oh, great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about Customer Workflows. You called out some strengths there, and you can see it in the net new ACV contribution this quarter. We're certainly hearing that from the channel as well. What would you attribute that strength to? It's such a broad portfolio? Are there any applications or use cases that you're seeing there? And might we expect to see creator follow the trend that you're seeing there with customer? Perhaps there's a channel play here, where there's some pipeline builds and some execution against that. Any color on just what's driving the strength in Customer Workflows and could greater follow that?\nCJ Desai: Yes. So thank you so much, Brad. So first of all, I would start with, through for CSM also had its best quarter besides Customer Workflow overall, including our field service management also had a great quarter. So when I think about this category, we were very good on tying front office to the mid office to the back office, and that has been our differentiator, not just the engagement layer, but actually getting work done when a customer raises a request. And now we have some of the largest brands in the world, which showed up at our Knowledge \u201823 event on how they are using our Customer Workflow solution, all the way from engagement layer, to mid-office and back-office workflows. So that's number one. The other comments that were shared earlier by Gina is that we are also seeing, in certain specific industries, Customer Workflows resonate really, really well. One is telco, as Gina shared on our industry-specific SKUs, but also when I look at public sector, when I look at government-to-citizen experience, all of that on our ability to get work done on ServiceNow platform and leveraging our back-office experience and tying that to the front office is resonating at the largest brands in United States and Europe. And I remain extremely optimistic on this particular product line as we have transformed how customer can be served better when you tie the front office to the mid office and back office. And on Creator, also very, very nice growth in Q2 driven by just -- there was an earlier comment on U.S. Federal, but we are seeing App Engine, which provides low-code capabilities for our customers, the ability to integrate with all the systems that are available as well as our platform encryption and just the security features of our platform, that is resonating really well from financial services to health care and many other organizations, including sub-verticals within public sector. So App Engine, when you think about low code and the text-to-code innovation that we will deliver in September, which we showcased at our Knowledge Conference, there is so much demand. And Bill touched on this early on when I speak to some of our largest customers, our midsized customers, the backlog on ServiceNow remains very high. And what I mean by backlog, they want to automate more things using ServiceNow. They don't have enough people who can automate more things using ServiceNow. So with Generative AI and text-to-code and text-to-workflow capabilities, that's what really excites them so that they can reduce the backlog, automate more using our platform, so they get higher value and become an efficient organization.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, CJ.\nCJ Desai: You bet.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question this afternoon. We'll take that now from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe a quick high-level question on the end. If you think about AI and adoption, this year could be tough for corporates, because the IT budget was set for enterprises last year. There was a lot of inflation from the vendor side. And so you're kind of squeezing AI out of the kind of tightened budget. How do you think about next year? And Bill, maybe in some of your conversations with Board members -- with Boards, like how are they thinking about the generational shift and how that impacts how you budget and how you plan for the coming years? Thank you and congratulations.\nBill McDermott: Yes, thank you very much. I want to go back to one of the comments I made earlier. There is no lack of interest in the C-suite for Gen AI. In fact, every one of them knows they have to have a playbook, and they're extremely focused on this. And most of the really forward-leaning ones are demanding of their C-suite direct reports that they're using this in their everyday business activities to run a better company, to run a more margin-efficient company and ultimately, a company that takes better care of their people and their customers. So this is set in stone now. This is real. This is happening. And what's interesting about IT budgets, and this is something that I shared a little bit with Alex earlier, where in IT as the standard, which is great, because the IT strategy has easily become the business strategy, but we are now going across all the personas in an enterprise. And what's great about the cloud business model, a lot of these personas have their own budgets and they're going to fund their own initiatives, and they're looking at ServiceNow now as a company that can fundamentally change the game. So I think that the future is bright. And whether you're thinking about customer and employee service desk where you have virtual agents that are serving queries and general how-twos, you think about text-to-code, you think about automating a classification of different cases and how you resolve them, how you take operational support, not only across IT, but proactively manage cases that go through all the other departments, how you have touchless correspondence and literally onboard all the business processes. So if you're Gina, you're thinking about, who are my partners, who am I going to procure things from, how am I going to make this onboarding process and all the visibility into all business operations completely seamless. So this is what's happening in every company right now. And I think we're going to be a big benefactor, because we became a platform company, and we now have the relationship capital with these executives to go way beyond just the IT budget. Not that, that's not a good place to be, but it's better when you can go into the entirety of the budget. And that's where all the user counts are. That's where the business model innovation is, and that's where we have the biggest impact. So that's where we're going to be. So I think the future, as you look into 2024, is going to be extremely bright. And I think we have to now do all the hard work to make sure we're the benefactor of a big cut of that overall budget in the company, whether it's at the department level or the central IT level.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes, okay. Excellent, thank you. Congrats.\nBill McDermott: Thank you very much, Raimo.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentleman, that will bring us to the conclusion of ServiceNow second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great evening. Good-bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "CJ Desai",
            "content": "Thank you, Gina. Thank you, Keith, for the question. And the way I would answer it in terms of the demand that we are seeing from some of the largest companies, some of them that were mentioned earlier from the industry perspective is very real. They believe that Generative AI, in context of ServiceNow, will deliver higher productivity. And I stay consistent that we are going to monetize only when we get higher value that are delivered for our customer and get a fraction of that value, whether it's 10%, 90% or whatever. So if a customer gets 100 points of value, ServiceNow keeps 10%, customer gets 90% of the value. What I mean here is our premium SKUs that Bill outlined will be Pro Plus. So this will be on top of ITSM Pro, CSM Pro, HRSV Pro with an exciting new offering for ServiceNow developers that we showcased at Knowledge, which will be text-to-code, text-to-workflow. These products are being released in September. We will see. We know how our adoption curve was for ITSM Pro and CSM Pro in 2019, so we have some models. But customers want to try it first, see the value, and then we will share with you at the next earnings on how things are going. Thank you, Keith. Okay. So first of all, thanks, Matt, and I will start. As it was outlined that ITSM Pro, as well as CSM Pro, which are very similar, customer-facing agents and employee-facing agents, had amazing growth in second quarter. And even when I look at the percent of total, I feel very good about the Pro trajectory that we have been on in this market for the past few years based on automation and other features that we deliver via Pro. Now on your question on seat expansion, the way I think about it is T times Q times R, where R is the rate of increase. So if you look at ITSM Pro, what we have seen is besides the 25% uplift that Gina shared at the Financial Analyst Day, the seed expansion has been 10%. And so you may ask, okay, why is that? The reason is very simple, as the world is becoming more digitized, as the corporations are becoming more digitized, the incident volumes or a customer service requests are going up. So while they are leveraging the Pro features, the seed expansion is not a coincidence, because number of incidents, whether you look at security incidents, IT incidents, our digital products continue to go up. And that's why I look at T times Q times R where R being the rate of increase on the number of if you keep the quantity constant, that R is driven by higher level of digitization. So when I think about Generative AI specifically, we look at this base of Pro and we think about Pro Plus. And given the value that is already being delivered by Pro, Pro Plus will allow you to gain additional value or whether it's the employees, whether it's our customers' customers or whether it's our agents. And that's why we feel very comfortable with the monetization strategy with Pro Plus because our customers will get value because of higher productivity, and we'll get a small percent of it. Yes, thank you, Bill, and spot on. So Kash, we have always thought about pricing of services in the context of what value our customers get, whether when we launched ITSM Pro, which was exactly five years ago, and we have kept the same price for ITSM Pro over the past five years. Now in terms of Pro Plus, based on very specific use cases, right? So I'll start with specific use cases, which we call domain specific. Those large language models we do not need to run super large language models because we are saying that, hey, for ITSM, this model will give additional productivity on top of Pro. And that productivity based on the use case could be significant. So from a pricing perspective, on the list price, we would like to be at least minimum, 60% plus when we start on top of Pro. So you're a Pro customer, you're already getting the value. We have seen it over the past five years, and we have seen the seat expansion happen as well. So on Pro Plus, you start with 60% plus. Customers are trying out this large language models. The models have accuracy, they are trying to learn themselves. Hey, do I take the prediction that comes out of large language model? Do I just accept it? But we fundamentally believe, which is what I shared at the Financial Analyst Day, that Generative AI is a tailwind for our business, but most importantly, the value that customers get. So I want to start with explaining the value, because you can say somebody is more productive for a particular task that they are repeating over and over again, but what percent of their day they spend on the task. And how do we look at the particular work week or a customer service agent or an IT agent. And then if we can say, okay, for your industry, for these use cases on ServiceNow, we believe we can deliver very high value, and hence, there is a premium we have Pro Plus. And we'll start with the 10%, 90% map. And as we see more and more value getting delivered, of course, we are going to ask for higher prices. Absolutely. So first of all, thank you, Keith. Lots of questions in there. And I would say when we launched ITSM Pro in September 2018, the exact same question was asked. And at that point, I said, okay, listen, if -- even if Q remains the same, with the 50% on the list price uplift, we should be able to deliver value for our customers. And how it has played out, though, is that not only we have been able to get 25% uplift on ITSM Pro, but in addition, the seat count went up by 10%, which is the rate of increase. Now when I look at Generative AI, to answer your first question, not only is Pro Plus, because it's also Enterprise Plus. Because Enterprise features are things like process mining, workforce optimization, skills mapping for the workforce in IT or customer service. So these are not related to AI feature set. So enterprise has a very different payload than Pro. So we are Pro Plus as well as Enterprise Plus. So that's number one. And number two, in your question around early customer conversations, customers are still dealing with labor shortage. They are still trying to figure out how they can make their labor force more productive. It is always about efficiency so they can get more work done. And in that environment, I have formed belief right now that Generative AI is a catalyst so that their employee base is still more productive. And so even if Q remains the same, I'm still optimistic on the rate of increase, as well as the price we will get because of the value we are going to deliver. Yes, absolutely, Alex. So I'm going to have Gina answer the CapEx and COGS question, and then I'll answer your pricing question. Got it. So Alex, the two things that I do want to share based on Gina's comments is, number one, we do not require large language model with hundreds of billions of parameters because for our domain specific use case, we can run what we have seen with text-to-code, for example, is one-tenth per size of OpenAI model. So that allows us to run it efficiently. It allows us to run while respecting the privacy of our customers' data. So that's number one, and that goes into the COGS answer that Gina gave based on the initial demand and customers that we are working with. Now in terms of your question around P times Q. The uplift that we believe we can absolutely price it as would be on the price. So if the quantity remains the same, the uplift will be on top of Pro with the list price, 60% uplift. And then, of course, our sales team works with enterprise discounts, all that you know how that plays out. And that's why if you assume that, why is that 60% is the number? It is all based on the value that we believe our customers will derive with additional Gen AI features that we are going to release for ITSM or whether it's for customer service management, those things, definitely, there is a cost of R&D and as well as cost to run something like that, but it will always be based on the value they get. So I feel pretty comfortable on the uplift list price on that specific price at the seat level. And then the second thing I would say is that we have seen, because of digitization on ITSM Pro, which was the point I was trying to make earlier, the seats have expanded by 10% over the last five years, while the price uplift that we have realized, which was 50% on top of ITSM, and we got 25%. Yes. And I'll just add one thing, Karl, on Gina's point, is that specifically in Q2, within Fin in the banking sector, we saw measurable progress across our portfolio, both in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe. So the platform is resonating. The largest of the largest bank expanded. And I can tell you that one bank, which expanded with us, is now close to -- at a TCV level, $100 million when they renewed with us in Q2. So we are seeing that banks are back, and there is a very decent pipeline in the second-half as well. Yes. So thank you so much, Brad. So first of all, I would start with, through for CSM also had its best quarter besides Customer Workflow overall, including our field service management also had a great quarter. So when I think about this category, we were very good on tying front office to the mid office to the back office, and that has been our differentiator, not just the engagement layer, but actually getting work done when a customer raises a request. And now we have some of the largest brands in the world, which showed up at our Knowledge \u201823 event on how they are using our Customer Workflow solution, all the way from engagement layer, to mid-office and back-office workflows. So that's number one. The other comments that were shared earlier by Gina is that we are also seeing, in certain specific industries, Customer Workflows resonate really, really well. One is telco, as Gina shared on our industry-specific SKUs, but also when I look at public sector, when I look at government-to-citizen experience, all of that on our ability to get work done on ServiceNow platform and leveraging our back-office experience and tying that to the front office is resonating at the largest brands in United States and Europe. And I remain extremely optimistic on this particular product line as we have transformed how customer can be served better when you tie the front office to the mid office and back office. And on Creator, also very, very nice growth in Q2 driven by just -- there was an earlier comment on U.S. Federal, but we are seeing App Engine, which provides low-code capabilities for our customers, the ability to integrate with all the systems that are available as well as our platform encryption and just the security features of our platform, that is resonating really well from financial services to health care and many other organizations, including sub-verticals within public sector. So App Engine, when you think about low code and the text-to-code innovation that we will deliver in September, which we showcased at our Knowledge Conference, there is so much demand. And Bill touched on this early on when I speak to some of our largest customers, our midsized customers, the backlog on ServiceNow remains very high. And what I mean by backlog, they want to automate more things using ServiceNow. They don't have enough people who can automate more things using ServiceNow. So with Generative AI and text-to-code and text-to-workflow capabilities, that's what really excites them so that they can reduce the backlog, automate more using our platform, so they get higher value and become an efficient organization. You bet."

            "name": "Bill McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Once again, ServiceNow's Q2 results beat expectations for all key performance metrics. Subscription revenue grew 25% in constant currency, 1% above the high-end of our guidance. CRPO grew 24% in constant currency, 1.5% above our guidance, and operating margin was 25%, 2 points above our guidance. We had 70 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, which was up from 54 a year ago or a 30% increase. As the market consolidates, customers are moving to ServiceNow as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. We have now more than 1 trillion workflows running through ServiceNow each year, and that metric is already growing at 40% annually. ServiceNow's long-term trajectory is being supercharged by Generative AI. ServiceNow is the most differentiated asset in enterprise software, AI first mover, organic innovation-led, fast top line growth, best-in-class profitability, 99% renewal rate, early stages of cross-sell expansion around our IT mode. We have said consistently, ServiceNow will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st Century. This Q2 beat and raise is another step forward on that journey. Looking at our solutions portfolio, large deals were evenly spread in Q2, which illustrates the broad appeal of this platform. ITSM was in 16 of the top 20 deals with seven deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 13 of the top 20, also with seven deals over $1 million. Together, security and risk combined for 17 of the top 20 with eight deals over $1 million. Customer workflows had a sensational quarter, its best net new ACV growth in three years. Customer was in 16 of the top 20 deals with eight deals over $1 million. Employee Workflows were in 14 of the top 20 with seven deals over $1 million, and Creator Workflows were in 18 of the top 20, with eight deals over $1 million. Great organizations are transforming with ServiceNow, including Barclays, BT, Honda, HP, Petrobras, CSB Bank in India and Yokohama City in Japan, to name a few. We see a sustained demand environment and pipeline for all of our product businesses, geographic regions and industry verticals. We're set up very well for a strong second-half. As you'll hear from Gina, we are raising our full-year guidance for subscription revenue and operating margin. This is an unprecedented market environment for enterprise software. Our good friend, NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, joined us at Knowledge \u201823 earlier this year. And Jensen stated the expanded NVIDIA-ServiceNow partnership is really important. Their partnership of choice for enterprise IT. He thinks it's an exciting growth opportunity for both companies. We agree. We're in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%. When you correlate that to ServiceNow's platform and our workflow leadership, it's clear we live in a great neighborhood on a super nice street, and maybe we're in the best house. With regard to artificial intelligence, especially large language models, ServiceNow strategy has been laser-focused for years. We accelerated that focus with our Element AI acquisition in 2020. Today, by some estimates, Generative AI could boost global GDP by almost $7 trillion. We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they're careful to remind me, it's all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow's AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer's enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy. As you saw at our Financial Analyst Day, ServiceNow is infusing Generative AI into all of our workflow offerings. We have since announced, Now Assist for virtual agent, which maximizes productivity by eliminating time spent searching for information. Another example is ServiceNow Generative AI controller. It allows organizations to connect ServiceNow instances to Bolt, Microsoft Azure OpenAI service, and OpenAI API large language models. We're going even further by expanding our Generative AI capabilities with case summarization and text-to-code, text-to-flow and text-to-new-application-development. Our customers are so excited for greater ROI and customer service, better employee self-service experiences and a substantial boost in developer productivity. They are ready to invest to drive these outcomes. And based on the immense value our customers will realize from our Generative AI innovation, we have a clear strategy for monetization. First, our existing Pro offerings had a record quarter in Q2 based on the hyperautomation technologies we already engineered into those products. For all new Generative AI capabilities beginning with our Vancouver release, we will introduce a new set of premium plus SKU offerings across ITSM, CSM and HR SV. We have also introduced a new ServiceNow AI Lighthouse customer program, alongside NVIDIA and Accenture, all in lockstep to accelerate value realization at the cutting edge of Generative AI. Specifically, this involves our engineers locking arms with NVIDIAs to codevelop new use cases for the enterprise. We already have the most significant pharmaceutical, financial services, manufacturing and health care companies engage with us. Additional customers will become design partners for new AI capabilities in their specific industries. We're currently evaluating a range of customers who are candidates for this program, and the interest is continuing to surge. These engagements share one sentiment perfectly in common: The propensity to buy is there. Even as our underlying growth is already strong as our Q2 results indicate, AI represents a market-making tailwind to ServiceNow. Intelligence is only relevant when it is delivered where work actually gets done. It's why our single architecture, single data model workflow platform has never been more relevant than it is right now. As AI goes to work, humans will be the real machines, because in most cases, AI augments people, it doesn't replace them. At a moment when employers face a 17-year high in unfilled job openings, Generative AI will lift human productivity, so we can chase even bigger dreams for the global economy and for the world. With our integrated suite of automation technologies, including AI, RPA and process mining, ServiceNow is uniquely positioned to lead the intelligence revolution, and we will. Looking broadly at the state of our business, we have the momentum with our upcoming Vancouver release in September, our products and engineering team will deliver even more AI innovation. Our partner ecosystem has never been more invested than they are right now. We announced an expanded strategic partnership with Cognizant to accelerate adoption of AI-driven automation. We expanded our partnership with KPMG to co-develop joint offerings through our finance and supply chain workflows. We launched a new collaboration with Guidewire to improve insurance experiences. We're also seeing extensive third-party recognition of our products. ServiceNow has been recognized for AIOps, app engine and cloud observability by prominent industry analysts. From customer service to risk to employee experience and ERP simplification, we can go on and on. This has fueled our rise into the Fortune 500 for the first time. And this is another tribute to Fred Luddy's founding vision for a hungry and humble market-leading company, and we're only getting started. In closing, this is a dynamic period for the IT industry. Think about it this way. Every leader in every department, in every business, in every industry is writing a new playbook for the AI world. CEO's are sponsoring them. The C-suite across all functions is funding them. And for the few true platforms, the opportunity is bigger than ever. ServiceNow injects speed into the business architecture. Our platform has become the de facto standard for intelligent automation. We are a growth company. We are profitable and durable. And thanks to the relentless execution and results speak for themselves, we believe in our people, our culture, our platform and our partners. The world is changing. Imagination is the only limit. ServiceNow is on the move. A CEO I spoke to this summer summed things up perfectly. She said, and I \u201cEverywhere I go, people are talking about ServiceNow. Whatever you all are doing, it's working. \" That's one of the many reasons we proudly say now as ever, the world works with ServiceNow. Thank you all very much. I look forward to your questions. But first, let me turn it over to our great CFO, Gina? And Matt, what I would build on from CJ's commentary, is this is the entire enchilada as it relates to transforming businesses. Generative AI and these LLM models are now putting CEOs in a position where they have to come up with a new playbook. So if you're talking, for example, to a telco, media and technology CEO, they're thinking, how do I reinvent my customer service orientation, the offers that I'm making? How do I manage the network? How do I deliver great service operations? Similarly, you might be surprised a little bit to know how forward leaning the public sector is. They're thinking like self-service citizen experience. How do I really rethink citizen-facing assisted services? How do I drive employee productivity and really rethink the way we're running things? And manufacturing, I met with one CEO that for every minute, the shop floor is down or isn't as productive as it should be, every minute is $500,000. So that factory employee, the sourcing and supply chain, building a digital factory, how do I rethink sales and service. And health care, health care CEO who's running probably the most prestigious health care institution in the world said, how do I rethink health care and completely model something that doesn't exist today as it relates to the patient care and how I can move services from an in-house establishment to somebody's home. Like it's all on the table. So the point that I want to make is this. ServiceNow is now in all of those conversations. And many of those you might have thought of as, wow, that sounds like ERP modernization, or probably sounds like a supply chain case or a manufacturing case. So actually, that's the point. We have become the intelligent enterprise for digital transformation, and we're lifting people out of soul-crushing work and modernizing these companies with a 21st Century platform that's resonating. You combine that with LLMs, the combination of NVIDIA and others, I really think this is a once-in-a-generation moment. Well, thank you very much for the question, Mark. First of all, when we get to the C-level, and we're talking to the corner office, it's all about innovation. And there is no lack of interest in digital transformation. There is no lack of interest in rethinking the employee or the customer experience or even how you empower people to do their best work, especially engineers and IT professionals because the digital strategy has become the business strategy. So the whole thing for us is not so much based on one month or one quarter versus another. It's having a chance to portray the broad vision and the completeness of vision we have with C-level decision-makers that understand what transformation really is all about. So that is the only limiting factor just making sure we get a chance to explain the breadth and depth of our story. In terms of the geographic scenario, we're growing in all of them very well. They each have their own individual scenarios. Obviously, you're well aware of energy and security and obviously, the Ukrainian situation, which is just a human tragedy. Americas is extremely strong. Europe is strong in spite of that because they need technology to dig their way out of a lot of the complexity. And Asia is going well for us, especially in Japan, where we have a new leader now, and we really feel like we planted a flag in Japan, and we have a new frontier that's going to grow really fast. So we're feeling good about all the geos. Some of the industries are doing incredible things. And yet at the same time, I want to make the point back to the platform. We had 19 of our top 20 deals with five or more products in the deal bomb. And in nine of the deals, we had 10 or more products. And that's a tribute to CJ and an amazing engineering team, but also in concert with Paul and our go-to-market machine, the collaboration on taking innovation from the factory and getting it in the hands of the customer quickly is really establishing itself as an art form here. And I'm super proud of the team, and I just want to give it up for the team. Thank you, Mark. And if I could just build one thing on Gina's commentary, John. You might remember the great Kevin Haverty that ran all of our sales force for double-digit years. Kevin, is not only with us, but he oversees the whole government business as an entity for the corporation, and we see amazing opportunities to take what we have done in U.S. federal also state and local, don't forget, 40 out of the 50 states here run in ServiceNow. We see a great opportunity to take that to Asia, specifically India and Japan, obviously, across Europe, Germany, France, the U.K., to name a few, and we also see expansive opportunities in the Middle East. And I just want to shout out to Kevin because him being here and being a part of our future, and also mentoring Raj and really building a powerhouse is just so exciting to me personally. And I love the Fed team, and I just want to give them a little shout out, too, because they're amazing. Yes, thank you. And one set of facts, Rob, that might be interesting to you and others is the loyalty effect. You understand cloud economics, of course, but there's also the human effect of loyalty. Right now, we took a very strong position with our employees that we would remain a loyal to them, no matter the weather conditions in the marketplace, that we would do it together. And we now have the best retention rates in the history of the company. We have 99% retention rate with our customers. So if you take the loyalty effect into consideration, the net present value of what that means, and you combine it with the net new ACV that we think we can get out of this amazing platform and the innovators that are leading the charge for us, we have a tremendous sense of purpose and confidence within the company. And I think that really is fun to watch, and it's pretty thrilling to see what we can do with our customers. And I'm excited about this brave new world. And we're really fired up and ready to go over here. Yes, Kash, Thank you so much for the question. First of all, the pricing power in a technology company is always representative of its innovation. And again, I can't thank the leaders from CJ all the way through the engineering organization of this company for their great leadership. And I believe strongly, we have something you can reference that's quite fact-based. We have already introduced AI into the ServiceNow platform for some time, as CJ said. And we're seeing the Pro version of the ServiceNow platform grow more than 50%, 5-0 percent, year-on-year. And in terms of putting a figure on it, with Pro Plus, where we are building those LLM models into the ServiceNow platform and extending those partnerships, I'll let CJ talk about what we think we can get, but it is on top, and it is pretty significant because the business cases for the customers are so compelling. Thank you, Kash. Thanks. And Alex, one thing I would also like you to know and everybody else is we're getting a lot of new logos. And every time you get a new logo, you get new seats. The other thing is on the platform expansion in the company, we are now in a world where we're selling multi-product solutions, business solutions, to significant companies and industries, and we're communicating with all the personas. So one data point that you might find interesting is that 19 of the top 20 deals this quarter, there was five or more products in there. That's a lot of seats. In nine of our deals, there was 10 or more products in the deal. And then finally, if you think about large-scale enterprise deals, we are growing our deals in the $20-plus million category 50% year-on-year. So we're getting a lot of new seats. And I think that is something that you should always keep in mind. New logos, expanding on the platform in every company, going into new geos, and new personas, all new seats. And then if you apply the logic of innovation and pricing, as CJ said, you're going to get a lot of good outcomes for the customer and for the shareholders. Thank you, Alex. Yes, it's a good question, Peter. One of the things that I would just share with the group here is we have really, really great partnerships. And I mentioned the Cognizant partnership, they're accelerating their adoption of AI-driven automation with us and taking that to market. KPMG, reimagining finance, supply chain and procurement. We talked a little bit about Accenture. They're the first mover in joining the ServiceNow customer Lighthouse program. But we also have other channel partners that are developing giving our sales force expanded reach, very large technology companies and reporting on that might be worth doing in the future, certainly wouldn't be against it. But you're right, that a lot of the technology partners, whether they're hyperscalers, they're part of the technology stack or they're just strong technology companies, they recognize the power of their solutions when you combine it with workflow automation from ServiceNow, because then instead of selling boxes or products in a SKU, they move into business solutions. And then they can customize that story by industry. And we're even having some situation in the channel where we're developing smaller bite-sized turnkey solutions that can be sold in a virtual world. So we can do a lot with the channel. I think it's early days for those technology channel partners. The SIs have all adopted us. All have now -- the big ones all have billion-plus practices. One is beyond $5 billion. So you're on a good point, and we'll be sure to talk about that a lot. Yes, thank you very much. I want to go back to one of the comments I made earlier. There is no lack of interest in the C-suite for Gen AI. In fact, every one of them knows they have to have a playbook, and they're extremely focused on this. And most of the really forward-leaning ones are demanding of their C-suite direct reports that they're using this in their everyday business activities to run a better company, to run a more margin-efficient company and ultimately, a company that takes better care of their people and their customers. So this is set in stone now. This is real. This is happening. And what's interesting about IT budgets, and this is something that I shared a little bit with Alex earlier, where in IT as the standard, which is great, because the IT strategy has easily become the business strategy, but we are now going across all the personas in an enterprise. And what's great about the cloud business model, a lot of these personas have their own budgets and they're going to fund their own initiatives, and they're looking at ServiceNow now as a company that can fundamentally change the game. So I think that the future is bright. And whether you're thinking about customer and employee service desk where you have virtual agents that are serving queries and general how-twos, you think about text-to-code, you think about automating a classification of different cases and how you resolve them, how you take operational support, not only across IT, but proactively manage cases that go through all the other departments, how you have touchless correspondence and literally onboard all the business processes. So if you're Gina, you're thinking about, who are my partners, who am I going to procure things from, how am I going to make this onboarding process and all the visibility into all business operations completely seamless. So this is what's happening in every company right now. And I think we're going to be a big benefactor, because we became a platform company, and we now have the relationship capital with these executives to go way beyond just the IT budget. Not that, that's not a good place to be, but it's better when you can go into the entirety of the budget. And that's where all the user counts are. That's where the business model innovation is, and that's where we have the biggest impact. So that's where we're going to be. So I think the future, as you look into 2024, is going to be extremely bright. And I think we have to now do all the hard work to make sure we're the benefactor of a big cut of that overall budget in the company, whether it's at the department level or the central IT level. Thank you very much, Raimo."

            "name": "Gina Mastantuono",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another exceptionally strong quarter for ServiceNow. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance range for all of our key performance metrics, delivering robust subscription revenue and CRPO growth, while continuing to drive operating margin expansion and very healthy free cash flow. In Q2, subscription revenues were $2.08 billion, growing 25% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14.2 billion, representing 22.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.2 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, transportation and logistics led the way with over 80% growth in Q2, followed by a very strong growth in education, business and consumer services, energy and utilities and government. In fact, U.S. Federal had its best Q2 ever, continuing the trend of strong growth over the past several quarters. Our best-in-class renewal rate was 99% in Q2, demonstrating the resilience of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. With that foundation from which to grow, top line strength in the quarter was further driven by healthy expansion of our existing customers. We ended the quarter with 1,724 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, including 45 paying us over $20 million, a 55% increase year-over-year. The Better Together Story is continuing to resonate with C-suites driving larger multiproduct deals as enterprises are looking to consolidate purchasing with our strategic platforms like ServiceNow. In Q2, 19 of our top 20 deals contained five or more products, with nine of them containing 10 or more products. In addition to our cross sales, our upsell motion also remained very strong. ITSM Pro had its strongest growth quarter since 2020, driven by both upsells from the standard SKU and seed expansions from existing customers. Overall, we closed 70 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up from [54%] (ph) a year ago, representing 30% year-over-year growth. What's more, 12 of those deals were over $5 million, of which three were over $10 million. We also saw a strong performance from our industry SKUs, with our telco and technology SKUs closing six deals over $1 million in net new ACV, and our newly launched public sector SKU gaining further momentum and landing another seven-figure deal in the quarter. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by continued disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 21%. I would also note that given our path to sustained profitability, in Q2, we recorded a large GAAP income tax benefit, reflecting a $965 million valuation allowance release related to our deferred tax assets in the U.S. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7.5 billion in cash and investments. Given the current macro environment and our strong cash position in May, the Board of Directors authorized the company's first-ever share repurchase program. The new program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.5 billion of common stock. The program's primary objective is managing the impact of dilution. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our outlook. While we continue to prudently factor the evolving macro cross win into our guidance, our first half outperformance has driven strong momentum as we head into the back half of the year. As a result, we are raising our top line and operating margin guidance. For 2023, we are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $95 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.6 billion, representing 24.5% to 25% year-over-year growth or 24% on a constant currency basis. We are raising our full-year operating margin target from 26% to 26.5%. And we continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84%, free cash flow margin of 30%, and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $2.185 billion and $2.195 billion, representing 25.5% to 26% year-over-year growth, or 23% to 23.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect CRPO growth of 25.5% or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 27%, and we expect 206 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, Q2 was another tremendous quarter of outstanding execution, and we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline remains strong as we've already seen $0.5 billion of pipeline generation from our Knowledge 2023 event in May. The week-long event of keynote, panels and customer discussions showcase the power and the endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflows along with the incremental opportunities unlocked with our Gen AI road map. Over $3 billion in pipeline attended with an over 50% increase in executive program attendees. The response has been overwhelming. Our intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation uniquely positions us to seize the opportunities in front of us as we continue to deliver durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company in the 21st Century. Bill and I would also like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. It's their commitment to excellence, which has propelled ServiceNow into the Fortune 500, and we couldn't be proud of. This distinction is a testament to our win as a team of core value and a culmination of the outstanding results we passionately delivered together in service to our customers, partners and investors. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Well, thank you, Keith, for all of those comments. I appreciate that. Vancouver launch is the end of September. So if you think about from a timing perspective, we won't see it even in the market really until Q4. I'll let CJ talk a little bit more about our very exciting Lighthouse program. But as we think about longer-term guidance, right, our scale is such that it's going to take a little while for us to see real impact on the top line, but rest assured, we absolutely are very bullish on the opportunities in front of us as we think about the value that we're creating for our customers with Gen AI. Thanks, Keith. Yes, it's a great question, Samad. And what I'd say is, listen, at the end of the day, what you've seen quarter-after-quarter from ServiceNow is solid execution. The demand environment is very durable. And that being said, we continue to be prudent with our guidance, right? At the end of the day, we absolutely believe that Generative AI could potentially bring renewals forward, but I'm not baking that into a guide right now. We just don't know what that's going to look like. What I can tell you is that from a -- if you think about the Q3 guide versus last year, we have a full-year now of slower macro demand, right? So really Q3 is when things started to shift. The Q3 of last year had an incredible Q4 of \u201821 and an incredible Q1 of \u201822 in that CRPO guide. Our CRPO guide now for Q3 is strong. We are reflecting lower level of early renewals as we continue to see. But you're 100% right. The Generative AI potential and opportunity could absolutely have some upside that we've not reflected into our guide right now. Thank you, Samad. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Mark. Yes. So John, what I said was that it had its best Q2 ever. And so Q3, as you know, is always a big quarter for Fed. But what I said was continuing the trend. So it had its best Q1 ever. It had its best Q2 ever. It had it best Q4 as well. And so it's not bigger than Q3, but it had a great quarter. It saw $10 million deals, including one over $8 million. And what you're really seeing is that our message around accelerating digital transformation journey is resonating. If you think about what they're looking to really partner with ServiceNow and platforms like ServiceNow, much more through an enterprise lens, more strategic, more multiyear, and they're really looking to digitally transform the citizen experience across the board. And so we're really excited about the continued trends that we're seeing. We have an incredible new leader in Dr. Raj Iyer doing incredible work with that whole team. And so you can only imagine that the opportunity remains really strong. Thanks, John. Yes. I would not say that we're giving you an all clear sign on the economy, right? I think we continue to execute extremely well, but from a macro perspective, I would say that there's not a whole lot of change, except for the commentary on Gen AI, right? So everyone is really excited about the productivity gains and the value that Gen AI is going to create for the business. What that means for the back half is, I believe, it's early to tell. But at the end of the day, what I'll tell you is our pipeline remains healthy, and we actually see higher pipeline coverage ratios going into Q3 than we saw last year. A lot of momentum coming out of Knowledge \u201823. I talked about in my script, over $3 billion in pipeline attended that Knowledge Conference, and we saw a 50% increase in the executive program attending. So if you think of the C-suite, the higher-up folks are coming to understand what ServiceNow can do and provide. And so we've created approximately $0.5 billion in pipeline to-date out of that event. And we continue to see strong demand for our team to fly out and do demos, similar to what we presented at K23, especially around Gen AI. And so I'd be cautious, like there's not a whole lot of change in the macro, but there's a lot of excitement about what Gen AI, and in particular, with ServiceNow's Gen AI strategy can do for customers in the short, mid and long-term. Thanks, Rob. Thanks, Kash. Thanks, Keith. So from a CapEx perspective, Alex, baked into our margin guide for this year, I'm not concerned, right? So any incremental demand is reflected in the free cash flow for 2023. As we think about going forward, at this point, we don't see any large requirements for increases. But as we see where demand kind of starts coming through in Q3 and Q4, the back half of the year, I'll reflect that in my guide for 2024. But rest assured, as you have known us to always do, if there is some pressure on gross margins as a result of a little bit more CapEx, we'll be offsetting that with operational efficiencies as we continue to roll out Gen AI capabilities within our own organization. Thanks, Alex. Yes. We -- so if you remember, I talked about the fact that we actually, in Q1, despite the macro stuff going on within that industry, we saw growth in Q1, and that was cycling huge growth in Q1 of 2022. And so we were really pleased with what we saw in Q1. And I would say we continue to see strength in financial services, and we had good growth in there and actually very good as we talked about deals with Barclays, for example. And so we continue to be demonstrating really strong value in all our financial services customers. So continued strength their costs. Thanks, Karl."

I would now like to turn the call over to Darren Yip, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDarren Yip: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer. During today's call, we will review our first quarter 2023 results and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2023. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2022 10-K, for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenue, remaining performance obligations or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation. which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. ServiceNow had an outstanding first quarter. Subscription revenue grew 27% in constant currency, which was 150 basis points above the high end of our guidance. The RPO grew 25% in constant currency, 100 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was 26%, 2 full points above our guidance. We have 66 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. We saw a strong, sustained demand to ServiceNow's platform. In January, we committed the company to performing beyond expectations. We said it, we did it. Our Q2 guidance reflects our strong conviction in the fundamentals of this business. We remain laser-focused on net new innovation, new business growth and profitability. ServiceNow is a growth company that consistently executes in any environment, and we will continue to do exactly that, execute. Looking at the big picture, there's no question this remains a complicated macro environment. C-level leaders are managing an endless array of headlines and mixed signals. When you filter all that noise, it comes down to one simple reality. There is an app for everything, but nobody wants every app. This consolidation is a tailwind for ServiceNow as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. We are now seeing conversations up level to business transformation. This is bringing CEOs directly into the process as principal executive sponsors. Nearly 40% of CEOs think their company will no longer be economically viable in a decade if they continue on the current path. They aren't interested in turf battles between departments, a one enterprise level investment to drive business impact. This isn't merely an inspection of what historically has been a big cost center. This is CEOs engaging on a strategic level, insisting on a clear roster of technology partners to drive very specific business outcomes. For example, when it comes to technology in the age of generative AI, it's a build-buy-operate conversation. They're looking for a single platform that can orchestrate the entire technology value chain. ServiceNow does just that. Businesses are also working hard to transform their customer experience. The AI opportunity here is when you integrate the front, middle and back offices to better serve that customer. This is a ServiceNow core competency. On the internal side, it's about reducing the number of touch points for employees to get work done. People can't maximize their potential by juggling multiple systems with different user experiences. Our customers use ServiceNow as the one-stop digital hub to create a consumer-grade experience at work. Whether it's efficiency, productivity, cost takeout or business model innovation, ServiceNow has never been more relevant. This is a message I hear directly from CEOs who know they need to shake things up, and they want our help to do it. Once again, these secular trends are fueling ServiceNow. About 70% of global tech equity value comes from firms that rely on network effects, and we see growing platform adoption across all of our businesses. ITSM was at 18 of our top 20 deals with 3 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 14 of the top 20 with 5 deals over $1 million. With increased focus on cost takeout, ITAM had a very strong quarter in 14 of our top 20 with 3 deals over $1 million. Security and risk were in 12 of the top 20 with 3 deals over $1 million. Customer workflows was hot in Q1 in 18 of the top 20 with 9 deals over $1 million. And this is worth emphasizing because ServiceNow is more relevant than ever as businesses invest in a differentiated experience for their end consumers. Very exciting indeed what we're doing with customer service management. Employee workflows was in 10 of the top 20 with 4 deals over $1 million. Creative workflows was in 18 of the top 20 with 3 deals over $1 million. Major global brands continue to accelerate their own transformation by working with ServiceNow. Marriott, Group Bimbo, Navy Federal Credit Union, Travelers, the U.S. Air Force and Schneider Electric, just to name a few. Look at banking as one example. PNC works with ServiceNow to modernize the way it manages disputes, which will reduce losses and improve case closures. We also saw major co-innovation milestones in the quarter. For example, ServiceNow and AT&T have created a global telecom product to help communication service providers manage 5G and fiber network in majority. Q1 was also the latest step forward for our organic innovation machine. The ServiceNow Utah release was engineered to drive faster business outcomes for our customers. The release includes AI-powered process mining, with robotic process automation capabilities, additional search enhancements, expanded workforce optimization and health and safety incident management. These are all designed to help increase automation, simplify experiences and offer greater organizational agility. It bears repeating that while customers are aware of market excitement for individual technologies like generative AI, they expect a platform strategy to integrate the various tools. ServiceNow has AI, process mining, RPA, low-code and many other technologies built natively into a single workflow automation platform. Of course, we will have much more to say about all of this at our Knowledge event in Las Vegas on May 16. I hope you can join us. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to Deborah Black, Vice President, Engineering at Netflix, who is the newest member of ServiceNow's Board of Directors. We're so proud to have Debbie's leadership on our journey to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. In closing, I'll simply reiterate things we've said consistently. First, businesses need ServiceNow. Enterprise software is mission-critical. The demand environment is robust. Second, ServiceNow is a unique company performing at a very high level. We are delivering strong growth, aggressively managing costs and creating immense shareholder value. The company has momentum everywhere. We're performing very well across the best places to work scorecards, including Glassdoor. Our brand recognition is increasing as we rise on lists like Fortune's Most Admired Companies. Our market opportunity is expanding, and this is the early days of a truly generational growth story. Finally, we know the trust is the ultimate human currency. What we have here is a platform, a culture and a company that is built entirely on trust. The results tell that story. We just eclipsed the $2 billion threshold in a single quarter, and we were the fastest ever to do that on an organic basis. This is about a fast growth, durable, predictable cloud business model. This will be the red thread at our Financial Analyst Day in a few weeks. We look forward to seeing you all there. Businesses work with ServiceNow. People work with ServiceNow. The world works with ServiceNow, and we're only getting started. I'd like to thank you very much for your time today. I'm looking forward to your questions. And for now, I'll hand things over to Gina.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. We saw resilient demand as the Now Platform continues to deliver the productivity improvements and our prices are looking for in the current macro environment. The quarter was yet another example of consistent execution from our team. In Q1, subscription revenues were $2.02 billion, going 27% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 150 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.01 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities, government and transportation and logistics led the way, followed by strong growth in education. Financial services net new ACV also continued to grow despite a tough comp and volatility in the banking sector. New customer ACV growth remained an area of strength, and the average deal size was up significantly year-over-year. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98% in Q1, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our customer cohorts have also continued to show solid expansion. We ended the quarter with 1,682 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 20% year-over-year. We're continuing to see healthy customer engagement with enterprise buying patterns demonstrating the extensibility of the Now Platform. We closed 66 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up from 52 a year ago. In Q1, 18 of our top 20 deals contained 5 or more products, showcasing how ServiceNow is providing customers the single platform they need to orchestrate their technology value chain. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by continued disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 35%. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7.2 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability. Moving to our outlook. Our pipeline continues to look robust for the remainder of the year, and we're excited about what the Utah release and Knowledge 2023 can further contribute to those opportunities. While we've seen market resiliency, we continue to prudently factor in the evolving macro cost with each of our guidance. As Bill mentioned, we remain laser-focused on balancing net new innovation and new business growth with cost management and profitability. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2023 guidance. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.47 billion and $8.52 billion, representing 23% to 23.5% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, operating margin of 26%, a free cash flow of 30%. And we continue to expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $206 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $2.04 billion and $2.045 billion, representing 23.5% to 24% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 50 basis point FX headwind. We expect CRPO growth of 22.5% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 50 basis point FX tailwind or 23% on a reported basis. We expect an operating margin of 23%, and we expect $205 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q1 was a very strong quarter. We're extremely proud of our team's performance, and we can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication. It's their collective commitment to our culture that has enabled us to be named one of Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For, yet again in 2023. The consistency of our results exemplifies the strength of our platform and our people. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. ServiceNow's intelligent automation is a deflationary force that helps enterprises retool their business to get more done with less. And since we use the Now Platform ourselves extensively, we continue to see the benefit from those efficiencies, generating incremental opportunities for further operational leverage. That's why ServiceNow is so well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. You can hear more about that momentum in our new products and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 16 in Las Vegas. We look forward to seeing you there. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Congratulations on another excellent quarter. So I wanted to ask CJ or Bill. You seem to be in a great position to embed AI into your Pro SKUs and try to unlock new efficiencies. Can you speak to how you see that opportunity playing out? And as chatbots become more powerful, do you see that affecting the headcount or seat count of a typical IT help desk or a contact center if you try to project that forward a few years down the road?\nChirantan Desai: Mark, first of all, thanks for the question. Here is what I would say. When we started the ITSM Pro journey in 2018 Q4, the exact question was asked because we embedded machine learning and AI into ITSM Pro, and that was a game changer both for our customers and our shareholders. When I look at specifically generative AI, we absolutely believe that besides our core machine learning and AI features that are in platform today, it is a clear and. And this particular and versus an or provides more productivity not only for the employees of our customers, but for the customer service agent or IT agents as you asked. And wherever we can capture that additional value, we will monetize that further via additional SKUs that we offer on top of our current offerings. So overall, I feel very good about generative AI and what it does for our business. And we have learned a lot through our ITSM Pro traction over last 4 years now, 4-plus years, and I feel very optimistic for next 3 to 5 years related to it is an accretive to our top line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America.\nBradley Sills: Wonderful, and great to see a nice start to the fiscal year here. I wanted to ask a question around the non-IT mix. If you take customer and employee, plus creator combined, it's 43% of new ACV this quarter, which is the highest I can remember. The question is, what is it about Now that you're seeing success kind of taking ServiceNow outside of the IT department? Obviously, you have these great products to address more workflow automation. But is there something about the go-to-market, whether it's direct or in the channel, that you'd call out here where you're seeing that real traction outside of IT?\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Thank you very much for the question, Brad. And I think it underscores the importance of ServiceNow becoming the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. As I said, the C-level decision-makers now, CEO, the CFO, obviously, the head of technology, along with the head of HR and the various other departments in the company, are aligning their business strategy on technology platforms that truly matter and can impact business results. And they're moving away from the apple of the day and platforms that don't matter. They're also taking antiquated platforms and building our innovation on top of them. So if you want to think about our unfair advantage, we actually started in IT and have extended that beautifully into HR, into the customer service management and into creator. Think about the importance of creator. 75% of the app development that will take place in the next 2 years will be done by the customers themselves on a low-code platform like ServiceNow. We feel we have a pole position. Customer service management, everybody is trying to align the front, mid and back office to give a seamless, self-service, direct-to-consumer experience on the mobile. It's our core competency. And when you think about the employee experience, there's wonderful systems of record out there that do what they're supposed to do, but our expertise is really taking a technology view of recruiting, hiring, onboarding, providing all the services and with generative AI actually giving the employee next best action and fundamentally changing the game on the productivity curve. All of this is aligning the executive team around platform strategy, and our teammates here at ServiceNow are proud and confident in that platform. They can tell the story by industry, by persona, and they can bring countless examples to the first meeting now, and they are aligning the executives. One of the biggest requests we get is, \"Hey, can we have an off-site with our entire management team with your team so we can figure out the best next step for the relationship?\" That's a very different outcome than we were doing 4 years ago, where it was a more land-and-expand kind of approach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Congratulations on a really nice start of the year. I want to dig in a little bit on the thread that Mark Murphy started pulling out in terms of the impacts of generative AI. And the question that I get a lot from investors is, does it necessitate that ServiceNow has to change their pricing model? And is there an ability to do that? So maybe if you could kind of walk us through, like as this functionality creates more automation and it's more just the workflows in the platform, the data in the platform that's driving the value, is there a necessity or a potential of changing the pricing model to be more consumption- or volume-oriented versus like a seat-based model?\nChirantan Desai: Yes. So Keith, this is CJ, and I'll address it. We think in multiple buckets. So when we look at technology workflows, as you know, that CMDB is the core foundation. And all the ITSM processes or ITOM or our security and fast-growing products like risk and asset management, they are all driven through our CMDB for a single end-to-end platform for transformation from a technology standpoint. So when I look at that for the most part, as you know, Keith, we have good, better, best packages. And we are pretty consistent in how we drive the go-to-market, as Bill described, overall at a platform level. The same thing is true for customer service management and HR as an employee workflow. And then when I look at creator workflow, we also have opportunity to expand ServiceNow ecosystem significantly, where anybody could be a ServiceNow developer by using text to code or text to workflow or, someday, text to app that they can create. So overall, when I look at the 4 buckets, the good, better, best mechanism that we have put in place is working beautifully. The traction is great. We are getting the uplift as we have shared with you and will share more at the Financial Analyst Day. Now in terms of additional pricing because now with generative AI, what I told Mark, is an and, as in you can get higher productivity for specific use cases. Whether it's incident deflection or whether it's related to the agent productivity, we believe that we can absolutely monetize that. We are fairly early, I'll share more with you at the Financial Analyst Day, on what that pricing model will look like, whether it's an add-on, whether it's a bundle. And we are working through the details, but we are only going to charge where we provide value for our customers, and that is the first principle we are looking at.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. I will stay tuned for Analyst Day for more details. Appreciate the color.\nWilliam McDermott: Keith, you would have been very impressed if you saw CJ and his engineering team in yesterday's Board meeting. We're actually dealing with real technology, real-time demos, real customer references, which you're going to get to see, and you're going to get to see examples and business cases that we're already working on at Financial Analyst Day. He's a little bit modest, and he deserves to be because he's got the best team in the business, but wait until you see Financial Analyst Day. It's really going to knock your socks off.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: So Bill, I wanted to ask you, ServiceNow is one of the few tech companies that we focus on that's still growing headcount, and you guys added more employees in 1Q than you did the last couple of quarters of last year. I'm curious, what's underlying that confidence in adding talent in what appears to be maybe a little bit of a slowing world? And how should we think about that strengthening your position in a world where maybe your competitors are actually going to have to go back and rehire when we come back on the other side of this?\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Samad, thank you very much for the question. And first of all, everybody is entitled to their strategy, and there's lots of great companies out there that have taken a different approach to managing headcount and the people packed. We have been highly intentional throughout the last 4-year journey that I can personally speak to on hiring in the first place. And we have been very biased towards great engineering, especially fingers on keyboards, and go-to-market folks that actually carry a quota and keeping the company extremely lean on G&A, where most of our investments have been in F. So we started into this macro scenario that the world is in right now in a thoughtful position to begin with. And therefore, we're still managing our headcount tightly. It's not like we're boldly hiring, and especially now we've doubled down on exactly that, quota bearing and fingers on keyboards. And the good news, and I really believe, we have a new dimension here where our culture is actually attracting people in the marketplace, and we're hiring truly best-in-class talent. We call it 9s and 10s here. If you're an 8.5, you don't get in the door now. So I would like you to take away from this answer, they're being very thoughtful about hiring. The numbers are commensurate with the new business they're bringing in the door, not the existing business. And they'll continue to do that in a way that manages the margin profile in importance with what shareholder value expectations are in the marketplace. And I honestly believe we'll look back at this moment and how we're managing the people part of the business and putting people first as something that created a very special, highly differentiated company as it relates to people's desire to work here. It's pretty interesting.\nGina Mastantuono: And Samad, I would just add, we're remaining extremely flexible and agile with how we're adding heads, and so we're being very cautious in the current environment. And you could absolutely expect that we will continue to be cautious and disciplined with how we're thinking about our hiring vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis our growth for the remainder of the year and really always.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. I mean we -- internally, we call it a checkbook approach.\nSamad Samana: Thanks to both of you, and we see it in the great margins, and look forward to seeing the team at the Analyst Day in a few weeks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. I'll offer my congrats as well. Gina, you talked about a strong pipeline exiting 4Q and obviously delivered a strong quarter here. How do you feel about the pipeline as we enter the quarter? And obviously, there's been some additional volatility in financial services, and it sounds like that was fairly stable for you guys this quarter. But maybe talk about the visibility you have entering the quarter.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So pipeline remains robust. We feel really good about pipeline moving into Q2 and beyond. From a metrics perspective versus same time last year across the board, we're in better shape. As you talk about the direct exposure to financial services, we actually saw growth and had some great customer wins in the quarter despite the macro headwinds. And so really feel great about where we're currently landing pipe, our Knowledge event, our Utah release. We're really excited about how we can continue to increase the opportunities in the back half of the year as a result. And so from that perspective, we feel really good about where we are. And as always, because 85% of our net new comes from existing customers, the visibility to our pipe for Q2 and the back half remains strong as well.\nWilliam McDermott: And one thing you may find interesting, Matt -- one thing you may find interesting is financial services, as Gina said, continued to perform. And in EMEA, 2 of our top 5 deals were in financial services, including one with one of Europe's largest banks.\nMatthew Hedberg: See you in a couple of weeks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.\nS. Kirk Materne: I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Bill, I was kind of curious on your impressions on just consolidation in this kind of macro environment. I think for a while, you've always said no one has to lose for you to win. I'm just wondering if that's changing a little bit in terms of your opportunity to go and maybe replace systems that have just gotten either antiquated or go after more greenfield that's adjacent to where you're selling. So just kind of curious if the consolidation wave is picking up, I guess, from your point of view.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Thank you very much for the question, Kirk. We stand by. No one has to lose for us to win, and I really do believe the systems of record that team up with ServiceNow would see dramatic increases in their win rates. That's obviously up to them, but there's no question that, that would happen. Because the power of the ServiceNow platform versus point solution is pretty clear. C-level decision-makers want an enterprise-wide workflow capability to drive their performance, and it's just that simple. And when you have a lot of point solutions that optimize the department but don't tie into the greater workflow across the domains or the functions, it doesn't really help at the corporate level. And I think that's the coherence that we bring to the enterprise productivity story. And frankly, the one thing I would say is that customers aren't interested in forced marches with upgrades to technology that's not delivering business impact. It's kind of like thinking about why would I do a heart transplant when I can do a simple bypass and gain massive, new productivity with a platform that drives a great user experience, empowers my employees, [ statisticize ] my customers and enables my creators? In fact, on the banking case, in particular, what you were seeing is some serious focus on risk management across the whole bank and using us to consolidate all the point solutions so there would be one dashboard or one version of the truth to protect that house. So you're seeing more and more of a platform approach to decision-making in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: Great start to the year, Bill and team. But curious, the strategy to expanding the base of customers, you've done a great job. You've got 7,700 customers, a lot of million dollar wins. But if you look at enterprise software beyond $10 billion to $15 billion, $20 billion in revenue, those companies have always had a base of the pyramid that has a big chunk of commercial customers, SMB customers. I'm curious how you think about ServiceNow's strategy to expand the base of the pyramid going forward.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Kash. I mean think of it this way. We are very focused, and I mentioned this as 1 of the 3 things that we're focused. We're very focused on net new business. And this is going to come from upper mid-market in particular, lots of new logos there. There's a lot of individual companies that talk a lot about their climb into the enterprise. We might just meet them where they live right now in smaller establishments. We'll see how that goes. But I can also tell you, we have a great focus on the Fortune 2000. And in particular, we have an amazing focus on the Marquee 250 with a true build-out of a go-to-market machine. And we're doing that by industry, and we're doing that with all the assets across the company. And we've collectively put that together in a way with the full power of the platform, the content, the thought leadership and obviously the solution power where the customer gets everything from ServiceNow. So I would like you to think about the top of the pyramid, the larger part or the big part of the pyramid and obviously the mid-market up as areas in which we are getting stronger by the minute and extremely focused.\nChirantan Desai: I'll just add one thing, Kash, that from a product strategy perspective, as Gina shared, we are very focused on top of the house of the pyramid, as you call it, in terms of expansion strategy, whether it's just additional products that we continue to deliver release after release or creating vertical-specific solutions for those industries where we can get higher ASP uplift vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis selling horizontal solution. And as Bill mentioned, whether you call that commercial segment, mid-market segment, we are absolutely focused on that as well from a new logo perspective. We have commercial go-to-market selling motion that allows us to move up, and those customers sometimes become massive customers, and that is an area of focus for new logos or new business in addition to the existing one.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add on new logo piece that our net new customer ACV growth remains an area of strength for us. I talked about this in my script that the average deal size is up significantly year-over-year, and that really is demonstrating the durable demand and the mission-critical nature of our platform in this environment. We actually landed our largest net new logo deal in EMEA this quarter with ITZBund. And we've evolved our focus to really make sure that we're going after those right new logos, those right new customers, those that offer us the best ROI and have the greatest opportunity to continue to expand with us. Not all logos are created equal, and we're really targeting those logos that can grow with us over time. And so it's easier to expand an existing customer. The fact that our new logo ACV continues to grow and do well is a continued area of strength for us that we're very proud of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Congratulations on the strong start to the year. The last time that ServiceNow had grown CRPO sequentially into Q1, we'd have to go back to 2019, but you just did it and you did it in a really challenging environment. So aside from what sounded like good sales execution, clearly, would you attribute the CRPO outperformance to the fact that you had fewer early renewals into Q4? Or is there another reason that you would highlight?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I would say that our beat versus the guide was fully due to higher net new ACV in the quarter. So great results from our incredible sales execution team across the board.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Gina, maybe just a follow-up on that, on the expansion fulfillment. One of the things that we've been hearing out in the sector is that there are seat headwinds as headcount growth is moderating at end customers. What are you seeing in your growth algorithm from a seat expansion versus upsell/cross-sell dynamic? And how has that changed at all?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. It's a great question, and we got that question a lot if you remember back in 2020. We're not really seeing any compression, right, where we're continuing to see expansion across the enterprise expansion geographically within a company and a customer and really as an upsell on the other workflows. And so seat compression has not been an issue that we've been seeing. Obviously, keeping a close eye on it given the macro, but not something that's been an issue for us thus far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: Congrats on a solid quarter. Maybe, Bill, can you talk a little bit about the macro from 2 different respects? One being, are you starting to kind of settle into this new longer sales cycle, customers making you pitch ROI every time, everywhere? And you're getting ready to kind of anniversary this in June, meaning it's a sense of like a stabilization or a new normal? And then maybe just comment on the demand environment vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis U.S. versus international because it does feel a little bit different depending on which geo you're in.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Alex, and it's a really good question. It is absolutely clear to everybody that our customers are operating in a complex environment. And the environment they're operating differs by industry, but all of them have a set of challenges that they're dealing with. So we have completely retooled the go-to-market machine in acknowledgment of our customers' challenges. So we're able to go in with content and thought leadership that's very specific to their industry. We have tremendous insight and depth in what's going on specifically with their business. We have excellent outside-in protocols and real detailed account plans and relationship plans. And obviously, at the end of the day, all of the sales that happen in this environment has to be backed by an unbreakable business case, not just a business case, an unbreakable one. And we have built that resilience into the go-to-market machine, and I'm extremely proud of our sales leadership in this company, and that goes for all the executives that report to me on the P4, but also the regional leaders and our feet on the street, I believe, to be the best in the business. So that's one thing. The demand environment, there is no shortage of demand. The whole idea here is to educate our customers on the art of the possible and make sure that we align business and IT. So the business executives are participating in this conversation because leaving them out shrinks the size of the deal, and that's why Gina is telling you the ACV is growing, including a new business, gives you a good signal that we are really educated and know what we're doing. But also by aligning the entire executive team, you derisk the last-minute surprise or the last-minute push because you have multiple executives pushing for the ServiceNow brand as an answer to their problems. So I would say the demand environment, there's no shortage of it, you just have to understand how to manage it. But our coverage today, and we manage all this on ServiceNow on a CEO dashboard, is better than ever.\nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add from a geo perspective, demand, pretty strong across the board. Americas had a strong quarter in Q1 with particular strength in health care and life sciences and state, local and education. We've focused verticalization strategy. That's really driven some strong momentum there. So we feel really good about results in Americas as well as demand. The number of million-dollar deals increased over 30% year-over-year, so that's great news. EMEA had a really strong Q1 as well. [ U.K.I. ], strong demand, great momentum. Central Europe continued to outperform. Renewal rates continue to be strong at 99% in EMEA despite the macro. So again, strong durable demand across the board. And then from an Asia Pac perspective, selling into the C-suite has been working well and really helping to drive larger transformational deals. We landed 7 $1 million-plus deals in APAC in Q1. So really strong demand across the board from a geography perspective as well, Alex.\nAleksandr Zukin: Your unfair advantage is very clear.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Great. I appreciate the strong set of results for Q1. The 2Q guide for CRPO suggests growth down a bit from what you just delivered, Gina. You've talked about prudence over the past several quarters. Can you maybe step through what you're factoring into Q2 for CRPO? How much is seasonality versus anything more specific to this year? And any update you can provide just around the change in early renewal dynamics you saw last quarter, I think, is also a useful context.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Great question. So from an overarching perspective, as I said before, the durable demand that we're seeing has really kept our business resilient, so strong Q1 CRPO. The Q2 guide, if you remember, beginning in Q2 of last year is when the macro headwinds really started to hit us. And so we've seen muted growth in the past couple of quarters as a result, which is driving a little bit of a decel in Q2. The other thing, as you rightly recall, on absolutely continuing to remain prudent in our guided assumptions given the uncertainty in the macro environment. And so again, feel really good about the guide. It's a strong guide given the current uncertainty. But those are kind of a couple of the things that are going into the number. With respect to early renewals, what I'll say is that early renewals actually exceeded our forecast slightly this quarter. And so as I talked about at the end of Q4, we really factored in some prudent assumptions with respect to early renewals given the current macro. And basically, they are lining up as expected.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen.\nJames Wood: Great. I'll add my congrats. Bill, I wanted to ask about the Microsoft partnership and the co-sell agreement. I think you guys announced that a year ago. I imagine you've been laying some groundwork. Can you just give an update as to how that partnership is trending, what kind of dividends you see in 2023 and what you may be looking to do around generative AI with them?\nWilliam McDermott: Yes, absolutely. Those conversations, Derrick, are very active. As you know, we're very proud of our relationship with Microsoft. Also, a big tip of the cap to Microsoft and Satya and his team for an outstanding quarter. I was very, very happy to see that for them. And at the end of the day, we continue to help accelerate Azure adoption for our mutual customers, which is opening additional addressable market for ServiceNow, particularly with ITOM and ITAM. I agree with you 100% that CJ can give you an update on what we're doing in the area of generative AI, but I think that, that work is in flight and in progress, and we think that's a big opportunity for both companies to work closely together. CJ?\nChirantan Desai: Absolutely. So here's what I would say, Derrick, is at the highest level, when we think about our partnership with Microsoft, certain products such as our ITOM product, which gives you visibility into Azure, and overall our product set that allows you to consume public cloud services, is going in the right direction. Our footprint of ITOM with Azure cloud continues to expand. So that's number one. From a go-to-market standpoint, whether it's in U.S. federal cloud with our IL5 certification just going live on Microsoft Azure cloud or the Australian government certification, we have had some recent wins in Australia and a few other geographies, where our go-to-market teams are working really well together. We will share more on generative AI with Microsoft, but we absolutely plan to leverage OpenAI as well as Microsoft Azure capabilities when it comes to how ServiceNow use cases will work in conjunction with OpenAI and Microsoft Azure.\nJames Wood: Great. Look forward to Knowledge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from MoffettNathanson.\nPeter Sterling Auty: You touched a little bit on my question in the last answer, but I just want to dive deeper and better understand the traction. What's driving the traction you're seeing in your observability solutions? How much of it is maturation in the Lightstep functionality and what you've built on top of it? How much of it might just be price and what you're able to bundle together as a platform?\nChirantan Desai: Yes. So I would say, overall, I put, including observability, all that in the ITOM umbrella, right? You can point out a cloud observability that our Lightstep team has done well, and they had an amazing win with a very large fintech company, where we are going to actually displace an incumbent that does metrics and tracing. And we beat all the top competitors to win that deal in Q1. This is an example. But overall, when I look at ITOM, and that deals with the cloud estate, whether it's private or public cloud, and as customers, our joint customers with hyperscalers are trying to optimize their cloud spend or expand, we are the right workflow platform when it comes to the workloads that are running in those clouds. And with ITOM specifically, we saw that our grow and enterprise adoption has actually increased, including higher selling volume in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, our cloud discovery that happens via ITOM with Azure, AWS, GCP is also on the rise with a number of customers using those capabilities.\nWilliam McDermott: And Sterling, the one build I would give on this, just for you to know, Microsoft and ServiceNow understand each other and have like-minded ways of going to market and including not just geographically but in industry. So as CJ said, this Australian government agency we're referring to is one example. But then you can go to South Africa, and you would see us doing something very interesting for an insurance provider, where we also displaced an aging legacy system. So we're on the front end of innovation by industry and geo, and we really have common goals and shared values around making these customers successful, and we both know how to do it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi.\nTyler Radke: Gina, just as we look at the updated guidance for the full year, I'm wondering if you could just walk us through some of the assumptions both on the subscription revenue side and margin side. It looked like you did beat by more than -- you're raising the full year guide if you account for currency. So just wondering if there's any extra conservatism or moving pieces. And then the same thing on margins, there was strong outperformance this quarter.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Tyler, thanks for the question. So we did raise the full year revenue guide by FX, and we did raise it slightly about $4 million for [ our fees ]. But given the current macro uncertainty and given that we're only at the end of Q1, we wanted to remain prudent in our guide for the full year, which shouldn't be surprising to you. There's many, many years that we haven't really raised in Q1 with such a big portion of the year still to go. So it's really about being prudent in the current uncertainty more so than anything else. We feel really good about the beat in Q1. And our guide, while prudent to reflect the current macro, I think still should send a strong signal to our investors on the durability and strength of the Now Platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. And I'll echo my congrats on a strong start to the year. For Bill or Gina, I've been getting a lot of questions on your net new ACV growth for last year, which was disclosed in your proxy as 14%. And considering the backdrop and tough prior year compare, it seems very healthy to me. But what factors should we consider in bridging to your $16 billion-plus target, which implies close to mid-20s compounded growth? And how would you characterize the company's net new ACV target for this year?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, Brad. Great question. So yes, net new ACV growth in 2022 given the current macro backdrop was very healthy given that environment. We've talked about the fact that the current macro as well as the FX movement would likely weigh on that guide for '24 and '26. What I can tell you and what I'm excited about is to make sure you come to Financial Analyst Day in May, where we'll be really focused on the longer-term strategy as well as updating those relative numbers for you. And so we don't guide for net new ACV, as you know, but we will give a lot of clarity as to what we're thinking for the mid- and longer term at FAD in just next month. So look forward to seeing you there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Maybe this one for Gina. Gina, on the call 3 months ago, when you were asked about the shape of the CRPO trajectory throughout the year, you guided to a deceleration throughout calendar '23. Just given that you outperformed in Q1, and conversely, the 2Q CRPO guide is a little bit below expectations, is that still the right framework to think about the second half?\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I mean, listen, Karl, I think that given the current macro, deceleration is very normal and expected, but you'll continue to see us really driving strong demand across the board. And so we absolutely think that demand remains robust and strong, and that we will continue to perform. But yes, given the current macro vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis last year, we'll definitely see a little bit of deceleration throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: One quick question on the platform side. So that's the one product area that really kind of gained a relative share for you guys this quarter. What are you seeing in terms of adoption out there? Because there's obviously a lot of like system of record guys that have a platform. They have the stand-alone local guys that kind of want to be a platform. And then you guys, you seem to be getting share. Is that kind of a function of, in the downturn or in tougher times, you have a consolidation to the core strategic ventures that's playing out there? Or is this more a longer-term theme?\nChirantan Desai: Listen, we are, first of all, Raimo, super pleased with our creator workflow performance that has many aspects to it. But the key aspect to it is, of course, our low-code engine and our automation technologies. This platform, as you described it, you're 100% right that there are many companies even with point solutions that market themselves as a platform company. We are truly a platform company. And when we sell creator workflows, that is sometimes used to extend our out-of-box applications. And sometimes, as Bill mentioned, customers use to create many, many new applications to digitize their processes. That business in itself is a very nice business that has been growing significantly over the last 3 to 4 years, and I feel very optimistic on that. And the reason I feel optimistic versus point solutions that you described or a system of record, because you cannot have all these applications being developed randomly without governance. Our key buyer tends to be IT organization. We serve IT organization. We have governance features on how you develop these apps. Where does the data reside? And when we say that to our customers, they say, \"We would rather use your platform to create new applications than a point solution or from a system of record that only has system of record data.\" And the second thing that's really working for our platform is we organically build our integration or automation engine that not only integrates with all the 600-, 700-plus applications out there in the world, but allows you to automate any processes via RPA, machine learning and many new AI technologies that we are going to deliver. I am extremely optimistic and bullish on this aspect of our platform, AKA creator workforce.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Great quarter. You mentioned that you saw a strong demand across front, middle and back office, and you also mentioned that you saw a strong demand for customer workflows. So in a down market, one wonders about front office. So I was wondering, how you were seeing that demand? And what specifically were the type of customer workflows that you were addressing and whether they were competitive or not with some of the systems of record?\nChirantan Desai: Yes. So Michael, first of all, I'll just address on customer workflow. Customer workflow, as Bill called it, was hot and shows a great quarter. What we saw, Michael, what we shared last year at the Financial Analyst Day with you and the team is we have now created industry-specific solutions, whether that's for insurance, for state, local and federal government, whether it's for health care and life sciences. All of those investments that we have made in the past few years are working really well in the context of customer service, and we are getting higher ASP. In addition, our field service management product is also resonating, and there are some of our competitors who have announced end of life or replatforming their field service management offering. We are absolutely capturing that opportunity, being a single platform company to have field service management solution alongside of customer service management solution that is industry-specific. I'm really proud of the product and engineering teams as well as our sales team on how they executed our horizontal and vertical capabilities for largest insurance companies, health care companies or state, local and federal government.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. ServiceNow had an outstanding first quarter. Subscription revenue grew 27% in constant currency, which was 150 basis points above the high end of our guidance. The RPO grew 25% in constant currency, 100 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was 26%, 2 full points above our guidance. We have 66 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. We saw a strong, sustained demand to ServiceNow's platform. In January, we committed the company to performing beyond expectations. We said it, we did it. Our Q2 guidance reflects our strong conviction in the fundamentals of this business. We remain laser-focused on net new innovation, new business growth and profitability. ServiceNow is a growth company that consistently executes in any environment, and we will continue to do exactly that, execute. Looking at the big picture, there's no question this remains a complicated macro environment. C-level leaders are managing an endless array of headlines and mixed signals. When you filter all that noise, it comes down to one simple reality. There is an app for everything, but nobody wants every app. This consolidation is a tailwind for ServiceNow as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. We are now seeing conversations up level to business transformation. This is bringing CEOs directly into the process as principal executive sponsors. Nearly 40% of CEOs think their company will no longer be economically viable in a decade if they continue on the current path. They aren't interested in turf battles between departments, a one enterprise level investment to drive business impact. This isn't merely an inspection of what historically has been a big cost center. This is CEOs engaging on a strategic level, insisting on a clear roster of technology partners to drive very specific business outcomes. For example, when it comes to technology in the age of generative AI, it's a build-buy-operate conversation. They're looking for a single platform that can orchestrate the entire technology value chain. ServiceNow does just that. Businesses are also working hard to transform their customer experience. The AI opportunity here is when you integrate the front, middle and back offices to better serve that customer. This is a ServiceNow core competency. On the internal side, it's about reducing the number of touch points for employees to get work done. People can't maximize their potential by juggling multiple systems with different user experiences. Our customers use ServiceNow as the one-stop digital hub to create a consumer-grade experience at work. Whether it's efficiency, productivity, cost takeout or business model innovation, ServiceNow has never been more relevant. This is a message I hear directly from CEOs who know they need to shake things up, and they want our help to do it. Once again, these secular trends are fueling ServiceNow. About 70% of global tech equity value comes from firms that rely on network effects, and we see growing platform adoption across all of our businesses. ITSM was at 18 of our top 20 deals with 3 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 14 of the top 20 with 5 deals over $1 million. With increased focus on cost takeout, ITAM had a very strong quarter in 14 of our top 20 with 3 deals over $1 million. Security and risk were in 12 of the top 20 with 3 deals over $1 million. Customer workflows was hot in Q1 in 18 of the top 20 with 9 deals over $1 million. And this is worth emphasizing because ServiceNow is more relevant than ever as businesses invest in a differentiated experience for their end consumers. Very exciting indeed what we're doing with customer service management. Employee workflows was in 10 of the top 20 with 4 deals over $1 million. Creative workflows was in 18 of the top 20 with 3 deals over $1 million. Major global brands continue to accelerate their own transformation by working with ServiceNow. Marriott, Group Bimbo, Navy Federal Credit Union, Travelers, the U.S. Air Force and Schneider Electric, just to name a few. Look at banking as one example. PNC works with ServiceNow to modernize the way it manages disputes, which will reduce losses and improve case closures. We also saw major co-innovation milestones in the quarter. For example, ServiceNow and AT&T have created a global telecom product to help communication service providers manage 5G and fiber network in majority. Q1 was also the latest step forward for our organic innovation machine. The ServiceNow Utah release was engineered to drive faster business outcomes for our customers. The release includes AI-powered process mining, with robotic process automation capabilities, additional search enhancements, expanded workforce optimization and health and safety incident management. These are all designed to help increase automation, simplify experiences and offer greater organizational agility. It bears repeating that while customers are aware of market excitement for individual technologies like generative AI, they expect a platform strategy to integrate the various tools. ServiceNow has AI, process mining, RPA, low-code and many other technologies built natively into a single workflow automation platform. Of course, we will have much more to say about all of this at our Knowledge event in Las Vegas on May 16. I hope you can join us. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to Deborah Black, Vice President, Engineering at Netflix, who is the newest member of ServiceNow's Board of Directors. We're so proud to have Debbie's leadership on our journey to be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. In closing, I'll simply reiterate things we've said consistently. First, businesses need ServiceNow. Enterprise software is mission-critical. The demand environment is robust. Second, ServiceNow is a unique company performing at a very high level. We are delivering strong growth, aggressively managing costs and creating immense shareholder value. The company has momentum everywhere. We're performing very well across the best places to work scorecards, including Glassdoor. Our brand recognition is increasing as we rise on lists like Fortune's Most Admired Companies. Our market opportunity is expanding, and this is the early days of a truly generational growth story. Finally, we know the trust is the ultimate human currency. What we have here is a platform, a culture and a company that is built entirely on trust. The results tell that story. We just eclipsed the $2 billion threshold in a single quarter, and we were the fastest ever to do that on an organic basis. This is about a fast growth, durable, predictable cloud business model. This will be the red thread at our Financial Analyst Day in a few weeks. We look forward to seeing you all there. Businesses work with ServiceNow. People work with ServiceNow. The world works with ServiceNow, and we're only getting started. I'd like to thank you very much for your time today. I'm looking forward to your questions. And for now, I'll hand things over to Gina. Yes. Thank you very much for the question, Brad. And I think it underscores the importance of ServiceNow becoming the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation. As I said, the C-level decision-makers now, CEO, the CFO, obviously, the head of technology, along with the head of HR and the various other departments in the company, are aligning their business strategy on technology platforms that truly matter and can impact business results. And they're moving away from the apple of the day and platforms that don't matter. They're also taking antiquated platforms and building our innovation on top of them. So if you want to think about our unfair advantage, we actually started in IT and have extended that beautifully into HR, into the customer service management and into creator. Think about the importance of creator. 75% of the app development that will take place in the next 2 years will be done by the customers themselves on a low-code platform like ServiceNow. We feel we have a pole position. Customer service management, everybody is trying to align the front, mid and back office to give a seamless, self-service, direct-to-consumer experience on the mobile. It's our core competency. And when you think about the employee experience, there's wonderful systems of record out there that do what they're supposed to do, but our expertise is really taking a technology view of recruiting, hiring, onboarding, providing all the services and with generative AI actually giving the employee next best action and fundamentally changing the game on the productivity curve. All of this is aligning the executive team around platform strategy, and our teammates here at ServiceNow are proud and confident in that platform. They can tell the story by industry, by persona, and they can bring countless examples to the first meeting now, and they are aligning the executives. One of the biggest requests we get is, \"Hey, can we have an off-site with our entire management team with your team so we can figure out the best next step for the relationship?\" That's a very different outcome than we were doing 4 years ago, where it was a more land-and-expand kind of approach. Keith, you would have been very impressed if you saw CJ and his engineering team in yesterday's Board meeting. We're actually dealing with real technology, real-time demos, real customer references, which you're going to get to see, and you're going to get to see examples and business cases that we're already working on at Financial Analyst Day. He's a little bit modest, and he deserves to be because he's got the best team in the business, but wait until you see Financial Analyst Day. It's really going to knock your socks off. Yes. Samad, thank you very much for the question. And first of all, everybody is entitled to their strategy, and there's lots of great companies out there that have taken a different approach to managing headcount and the people packed. We have been highly intentional throughout the last 4-year journey that I can personally speak to on hiring in the first place. And we have been very biased towards great engineering, especially fingers on keyboards, and go-to-market folks that actually carry a quota and keeping the company extremely lean on G&A, where most of our investments have been in F. So we started into this macro scenario that the world is in right now in a thoughtful position to begin with. And therefore, we're still managing our headcount tightly. It's not like we're boldly hiring, and especially now we've doubled down on exactly that, quota bearing and fingers on keyboards. And the good news, and I really believe, we have a new dimension here where our culture is actually attracting people in the marketplace, and we're hiring truly best-in-class talent. We call it 9s and 10s here. If you're an 8.5, you don't get in the door now. So I would like you to take away from this answer, they're being very thoughtful about hiring. The numbers are commensurate with the new business they're bringing in the door, not the existing business. And they'll continue to do that in a way that manages the margin profile in importance with what shareholder value expectations are in the marketplace. And I honestly believe we'll look back at this moment and how we're managing the people part of the business and putting people first as something that created a very special, highly differentiated company as it relates to people's desire to work here. It's pretty interesting. Yes. I mean we -- internally, we call it a checkbook approach. And one thing you may find interesting, Matt -- one thing you may find interesting is financial services, as Gina said, continued to perform. And in EMEA, 2 of our top 5 deals were in financial services, including one with one of Europe's largest banks. Yes. Thank you very much for the question, Kirk. We stand by. No one has to lose for us to win, and I really do believe the systems of record that team up with ServiceNow would see dramatic increases in their win rates. That's obviously up to them, but there's no question that, that would happen. Because the power of the ServiceNow platform versus point solution is pretty clear. C-level decision-makers want an enterprise-wide workflow capability to drive their performance, and it's just that simple. And when you have a lot of point solutions that optimize the department but don't tie into the greater workflow across the domains or the functions, it doesn't really help at the corporate level. And I think that's the coherence that we bring to the enterprise productivity story. And frankly, the one thing I would say is that customers aren't interested in forced marches with upgrades to technology that's not delivering business impact. It's kind of like thinking about why would I do a heart transplant when I can do a simple bypass and gain massive, new productivity with a platform that drives a great user experience, empowers my employees, [ statisticize ] my customers and enables my creators? In fact, on the banking case, in particular, what you were seeing is some serious focus on risk management across the whole bank and using us to consolidate all the point solutions so there would be one dashboard or one version of the truth to protect that house. So you're seeing more and more of a platform approach to decision-making in the market. Thank you very much, Kash. I mean think of it this way. We are very focused, and I mentioned this as 1 of the 3 things that we're focused. We're very focused on net new business. And this is going to come from upper mid-market in particular, lots of new logos there. There's a lot of individual companies that talk a lot about their climb into the enterprise. We might just meet them where they live right now in smaller establishments. We'll see how that goes. But I can also tell you, we have a great focus on the Fortune 2000. And in particular, we have an amazing focus on the Marquee 250 with a true build-out of a go-to-market machine. And we're doing that by industry, and we're doing that with all the assets across the company. And we've collectively put that together in a way with the full power of the platform, the content, the thought leadership and obviously the solution power where the customer gets everything from ServiceNow. So I would like you to think about the top of the pyramid, the larger part or the big part of the pyramid and obviously the mid-market up as areas in which we are getting stronger by the minute and extremely focused. Thank you very much for the question, Alex, and it's a really good question. It is absolutely clear to everybody that our customers are operating in a complex environment. And the environment they're operating differs by industry, but all of them have a set of challenges that they're dealing with. So we have completely retooled the go-to-market machine in acknowledgment of our customers' challenges. So we're able to go in with content and thought leadership that's very specific to their industry. We have tremendous insight and depth in what's going on specifically with their business. We have excellent outside-in protocols and real detailed account plans and relationship plans. And obviously, at the end of the day, all of the sales that happen in this environment has to be backed by an unbreakable business case, not just a business case, an unbreakable one. And we have built that resilience into the go-to-market machine, and I'm extremely proud of our sales leadership in this company, and that goes for all the executives that report to me on the P4, but also the regional leaders and our feet on the street, I believe, to be the best in the business. So that's one thing. The demand environment, there is no shortage of demand. The whole idea here is to educate our customers on the art of the possible and make sure that we align business and IT. So the business executives are participating in this conversation because leaving them out shrinks the size of the deal, and that's why Gina is telling you the ACV is growing, including a new business, gives you a good signal that we are really educated and know what we're doing. But also by aligning the entire executive team, you derisk the last-minute surprise or the last-minute push because you have multiple executives pushing for the ServiceNow brand as an answer to their problems. So I would say the demand environment, there's no shortage of it, you just have to understand how to manage it. But our coverage today, and we manage all this on ServiceNow on a CEO dashboard, is better than ever. Yes, absolutely. Those conversations, Derrick, are very active. As you know, we're very proud of our relationship with Microsoft. Also, a big tip of the cap to Microsoft and Satya and his team for an outstanding quarter. I was very, very happy to see that for them. And at the end of the day, we continue to help accelerate Azure adoption for our mutual customers, which is opening additional addressable market for ServiceNow, particularly with ITOM and ITAM. I agree with you 100% that CJ can give you an update on what we're doing in the area of generative AI, but I think that, that work is in flight and in progress, and we think that's a big opportunity for both companies to work closely together. CJ? And Sterling, the one build I would give on this, just for you to know, Microsoft and ServiceNow understand each other and have like-minded ways of going to market and including not just geographically but in industry. So as CJ said, this Australian government agency we're referring to is one example. But then you can go to South Africa, and you would see us doing something very interesting for an insurance provider, where we also displaced an aging legacy system. So we're on the front end of innovation by industry and geo, and we really have common goals and shared values around making these customers successful, and we both know how to do it."

            "content": "Mark, first of all, thanks for the question. Here is what I would say. When we started the ITSM Pro journey in 2018 Q4, the exact question was asked because we embedded machine learning and AI into ITSM Pro, and that was a game changer both for our customers and our shareholders. When I look at specifically generative AI, we absolutely believe that besides our core machine learning and AI features that are in platform today, it is a clear and. And this particular and versus an or provides more productivity not only for the employees of our customers, but for the customer service agent or IT agents as you asked. And wherever we can capture that additional value, we will monetize that further via additional SKUs that we offer on top of our current offerings. So overall, I feel very good about generative AI and what it does for our business. And we have learned a lot through our ITSM Pro traction over last 4 years now, 4-plus years, and I feel very optimistic for next 3 to 5 years related to it is an accretive to our top line. Yes. So Keith, this is CJ, and I'll address it. We think in multiple buckets. So when we look at technology workflows, as you know, that CMDB is the core foundation. And all the ITSM processes or ITOM or our security and fast-growing products like risk and asset management, they are all driven through our CMDB for a single end-to-end platform for transformation from a technology standpoint. So when I look at that for the most part, as you know, Keith, we have good, better, best packages. And we are pretty consistent in how we drive the go-to-market, as Bill described, overall at a platform level. The same thing is true for customer service management and HR as an employee workflow. And then when I look at creator workflow, we also have opportunity to expand ServiceNow ecosystem significantly, where anybody could be a ServiceNow developer by using text to code or text to workflow or, someday, text to app that they can create. So overall, when I look at the 4 buckets, the good, better, best mechanism that we have put in place is working beautifully. The traction is great. We are getting the uplift as we have shared with you and will share more at the Financial Analyst Day. Now in terms of additional pricing because now with generative AI, what I told Mark, is an and, as in you can get higher productivity for specific use cases. Whether it's incident deflection or whether it's related to the agent productivity, we believe that we can absolutely monetize that. We are fairly early, I'll share more with you at the Financial Analyst Day, on what that pricing model will look like, whether it's an add-on, whether it's a bundle. And we are working through the details, but we are only going to charge where we provide value for our customers, and that is the first principle we are looking at. I'll just add one thing, Kash, that from a product strategy perspective, as Gina shared, we are very focused on top of the house of the pyramid, as you call it, in terms of expansion strategy, whether it's just additional products that we continue to deliver release after release or creating vertical-specific solutions for those industries where we can get higher ASP uplift vis-A\u0303 -vis selling horizontal solution. And as Bill mentioned, whether you call that commercial segment, mid-market segment, we are absolutely focused on that as well from a new logo perspective. We have commercial go-to-market selling motion that allows us to move up, and those customers sometimes become massive customers, and that is an area of focus for new logos or new business in addition to the existing one. Absolutely. So here's what I would say, Derrick, is at the highest level, when we think about our partnership with Microsoft, certain products such as our ITOM product, which gives you visibility into Azure, and overall our product set that allows you to consume public cloud services, is going in the right direction. Our footprint of ITOM with Azure cloud continues to expand. So that's number one. From a go-to-market standpoint, whether it's in U.S. federal cloud with our IL5 certification just going live on Microsoft Azure cloud or the Australian government certification, we have had some recent wins in Australia and a few other geographies, where our go-to-market teams are working really well together. We will share more on generative AI with Microsoft, but we absolutely plan to leverage OpenAI as well as Microsoft Azure capabilities when it comes to how ServiceNow use cases will work in conjunction with OpenAI and Microsoft Azure. Yes. So I would say, overall, I put, including observability, all that in the ITOM umbrella, right? You can point out a cloud observability that our Lightstep team has done well, and they had an amazing win with a very large fintech company, where we are going to actually displace an incumbent that does metrics and tracing. And we beat all the top competitors to win that deal in Q1. This is an example. But overall, when I look at ITOM, and that deals with the cloud estate, whether it's private or public cloud, and as customers, our joint customers with hyperscalers are trying to optimize their cloud spend or expand, we are the right workflow platform when it comes to the workloads that are running in those clouds. And with ITOM specifically, we saw that our grow and enterprise adoption has actually increased, including higher selling volume in Q1 of this year. In addition to that, our cloud discovery that happens via ITOM with Azure, AWS, GCP is also on the rise with a number of customers using those capabilities. Listen, we are, first of all, Raimo, super pleased with our creator workflow performance that has many aspects to it. But the key aspect to it is, of course, our low-code engine and our automation technologies. This platform, as you described it, you're 100% right that there are many companies even with point solutions that market themselves as a platform company. We are truly a platform company. And when we sell creator workflows, that is sometimes used to extend our out-of-box applications. And sometimes, as Bill mentioned, customers use to create many, many new applications to digitize their processes. That business in itself is a very nice business that has been growing significantly over the last 3 to 4 years, and I feel very optimistic on that. And the reason I feel optimistic versus point solutions that you described or a system of record, because you cannot have all these applications being developed randomly without governance. Our key buyer tends to be IT organization. We serve IT organization. We have governance features on how you develop these apps. Where does the data reside? And when we say that to our customers, they say, \"We would rather use your platform to create new applications than a point solution or from a system of record that only has system of record data.\" And the second thing that's really working for our platform is we organically build our integration or automation engine that not only integrates with all the 600-, 700-plus applications out there in the world, but allows you to automate any processes via RPA, machine learning and many new AI technologies that we are going to deliver. I am extremely optimistic and bullish on this aspect of our platform, AKA creator workforce. Yes. So Michael, first of all, I'll just address on customer workflow. Customer workflow, as Bill called it, was hot and shows a great quarter. What we saw, Michael, what we shared last year at the Financial Analyst Day with you and the team is we have now created industry-specific solutions, whether that's for insurance, for state, local and federal government, whether it's for health care and life sciences. All of those investments that we have made in the past few years are working really well in the context of customer service, and we are getting higher ASP. In addition, our field service management product is also resonating, and there are some of our competitors who have announced end of life or replatforming their field service management offering. We are absolutely capturing that opportunity, being a single platform company to have field service management solution alongside of customer service management solution that is industry-specific. I'm really proud of the product and engineering teams as well as our sales team on how they executed our horizontal and vertical capabilities for largest insurance companies, health care companies or state, local and federal government."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q1 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metrics. We saw resilient demand as the Now Platform continues to deliver the productivity improvements and our prices are looking for in the current macro environment. The quarter was yet another example of consistent execution from our team. In Q1, subscription revenues were $2.02 billion, going 27% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 150 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $14 billion, representing 24% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $7.01 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance. From an industry perspective, energy and utilities, government and transportation and logistics led the way, followed by strong growth in education. Financial services net new ACV also continued to grow despite a tough comp and volatility in the banking sector. New customer ACV growth remained an area of strength, and the average deal size was up significantly year-over-year. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98% in Q1, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations. Our customer cohorts have also continued to show solid expansion. We ended the quarter with 1,682 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 20% year-over-year. We're continuing to see healthy customer engagement with enterprise buying patterns demonstrating the extensibility of the Now Platform. We closed 66 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, up from 52 a year ago. In Q1, 18 of our top 20 deals contained 5 or more products, showcasing how ServiceNow is providing customers the single platform they need to orchestrate their technology value chain. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by continued disciplined spend management. Our free cash flow margin was 35%. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $7.2 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability. Moving to our outlook. Our pipeline continues to look robust for the remainder of the year, and we're excited about what the Utah release and Knowledge 2023 can further contribute to those opportunities. While we've seen market resiliency, we continue to prudently factor in the evolving macro cost with each of our guidance. As Bill mentioned, we remain laser-focused on balancing net new innovation and new business growth with cost management and profitability. With that in mind, let's turn to our 2023 guidance. We are raising our subscription revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint to a range of $8.47 billion and $8.52 billion, representing 23% to 23.5% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, operating margin of 26%, a free cash flow of 30%. And we continue to expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $206 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $2.04 billion and $2.045 billion, representing 23.5% to 24% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 50 basis point FX headwind. We expect CRPO growth of 22.5% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 50 basis point FX tailwind or 23% on a reported basis. We expect an operating margin of 23%, and we expect $205 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q1 was a very strong quarter. We're extremely proud of our team's performance, and we can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication. It's their collective commitment to our culture that has enabled us to be named one of Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For, yet again in 2023. The consistency of our results exemplifies the strength of our platform and our people. We're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty and significant productivity gains. ServiceNow's intelligent automation is a deflationary force that helps enterprises retool their business to get more done with less. And since we use the Now Platform ourselves extensively, we continue to see the benefit from those efficiencies, generating incremental opportunities for further operational leverage. That's why ServiceNow is so well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. You can hear more about that momentum in our new products and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 16 in Las Vegas. We look forward to seeing you there. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A. And Samad, I would just add, we're remaining extremely flexible and agile with how we're adding heads, and so we're being very cautious in the current environment. And you could absolutely expect that we will continue to be cautious and disciplined with how we're thinking about our hiring vis-A\u0303 -vis our growth for the remainder of the year and really always. Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So pipeline remains robust. We feel really good about pipeline moving into Q2 and beyond. From a metrics perspective versus same time last year across the board, we're in better shape. As you talk about the direct exposure to financial services, we actually saw growth and had some great customer wins in the quarter despite the macro headwinds. And so really feel great about where we're currently landing pipe, our Knowledge event, our Utah release. We're really excited about how we can continue to increase the opportunities in the back half of the year as a result. And so from that perspective, we feel really good about where we are. And as always, because 85% of our net new comes from existing customers, the visibility to our pipe for Q2 and the back half remains strong as well. And I would just add on new logo piece that our net new customer ACV growth remains an area of strength for us. I talked about this in my script that the average deal size is up significantly year-over-year, and that really is demonstrating the durable demand and the mission-critical nature of our platform in this environment. We actually landed our largest net new logo deal in EMEA this quarter with ITZBund. And we've evolved our focus to really make sure that we're going after those right new logos, those right new customers, those that offer us the best ROI and have the greatest opportunity to continue to expand with us. Not all logos are created equal, and we're really targeting those logos that can grow with us over time. And so it's easier to expand an existing customer. The fact that our new logo ACV continues to grow and do well is a continued area of strength for us that we're very proud of. Yes. I would say that our beat versus the guide was fully due to higher net new ACV in the quarter. So great results from our incredible sales execution team across the board. Yes. It's a great question, and we got that question a lot if you remember back in 2020. We're not really seeing any compression, right, where we're continuing to see expansion across the enterprise expansion geographically within a company and a customer and really as an upsell on the other workflows. And so seat compression has not been an issue that we've been seeing. Obviously, keeping a close eye on it given the macro, but not something that's been an issue for us thus far. And I would just add from a geo perspective, demand, pretty strong across the board. Americas had a strong quarter in Q1 with particular strength in health care and life sciences and state, local and education. We've focused verticalization strategy. That's really driven some strong momentum there. So we feel really good about results in Americas as well as demand. The number of million-dollar deals increased over 30% year-over-year, so that's great news. EMEA had a really strong Q1 as well. [ U.K.I. ], strong demand, great momentum. Central Europe continued to outperform. Renewal rates continue to be strong at 99% in EMEA despite the macro. So again, strong durable demand across the board. And then from an Asia Pac perspective, selling into the C-suite has been working well and really helping to drive larger transformational deals. We landed 7 $1 million-plus deals in APAC in Q1. So really strong demand across the board from a geography perspective as well, Alex. Yes. Great question. So from an overarching perspective, as I said before, the durable demand that we're seeing has really kept our business resilient, so strong Q1 CRPO. The Q2 guide, if you remember, beginning in Q2 of last year is when the macro headwinds really started to hit us. And so we've seen muted growth in the past couple of quarters as a result, which is driving a little bit of a decel in Q2. The other thing, as you rightly recall, on absolutely continuing to remain prudent in our guided assumptions given the uncertainty in the macro environment. And so again, feel really good about the guide. It's a strong guide given the current uncertainty. But those are kind of a couple of the things that are going into the number. With respect to early renewals, what I'll say is that early renewals actually exceeded our forecast slightly this quarter. And so as I talked about at the end of Q4, we really factored in some prudent assumptions with respect to early renewals given the current macro. And basically, they are lining up as expected. Yes. Tyler, thanks for the question. So we did raise the full year revenue guide by FX, and we did raise it slightly about $4 million for [ our fees ]. But given the current macro uncertainty and given that we're only at the end of Q1, we wanted to remain prudent in our guide for the full year, which shouldn't be surprising to you. There's many, many years that we haven't really raised in Q1 with such a big portion of the year still to go. So it's really about being prudent in the current uncertainty more so than anything else. We feel really good about the beat in Q1. And our guide, while prudent to reflect the current macro, I think still should send a strong signal to our investors on the durability and strength of the Now Platform. Yes, Brad. Great question. So yes, net new ACV growth in 2022 given the current macro backdrop was very healthy given that environment. We've talked about the fact that the current macro as well as the FX movement would likely weigh on that guide for '24 and '26. What I can tell you and what I'm excited about is to make sure you come to Financial Analyst Day in May, where we'll be really focused on the longer-term strategy as well as updating those relative numbers for you. And so we don't guide for net new ACV, as you know, but we will give a lot of clarity as to what we're thinking for the mid- and longer term at FAD in just next month. So look forward to seeing you there. Yes. I mean, listen, Karl, I think that given the current macro, deceleration is very normal and expected, but you'll continue to see us really driving strong demand across the board. And so we absolutely think that demand remains robust and strong, and that we will continue to perform. But yes, given the current macro vis-A\u0303 -vis last year, we'll definitely see a little bit of deceleration throughout the year."

I really appreciate you joining today. There's a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report. I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow's growth trajectory. The first is elite level execution. With our Q3 results, we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution. We outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. cRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31%, more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. We landed our second largest new logo deal ever and our second customer crossed the $100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow's platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams, ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals with double-digit deals over $1 million. It's also worth noting that IT asset management was in all of our top 20 deals. Q3 was another strong performance for Security and Risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over $1 million. As we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over $1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over $1 million and creative workflow was strong again in 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over $1 million. Here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment. ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the Rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution. The second tailwind behind ServiceNow's success is our growing strategic relevance. For years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems. Organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess, so they can modernize for the AI world, ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platforms. And we integrate with all those other systems, orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer-grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here. When public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control, the cost, security and integration. And ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI. We do see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower, which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver. ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With Now Assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six over $5 million and two over $10 million, and this continues to be our fastest-growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross-enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest gen AI release to date, Xanadu. This included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged Now Assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft CoPilot integration and more. Xanadu expanded industry vertical AI-powered automation for telco, tech, public sector, banking, insurance and manufacturing. We released Now Assist with security, procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers. Xanadu showcased ServiceNow's leadership with Agentic AI. And until now, generative AI and the enterprise require human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow single architecture platform and cross enterprise data, ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond pro-based activity to deep contextual comprehension. This is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy. This is why IDC also forecast businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once-in-a-generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result. The fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a prescient identity for our brand. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow Assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project, Banco do Brasil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation. The Veteran Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission-critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI-powered solutions to improve its colleague experience. After rolling out Now Assist globally, EY works ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks, to deliver faster resolutions or enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life-saving mission. Mercedes Benz works with ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cybersecurity driving the integration of Gen AI into shop floor operations. Bill Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC Technologies, a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace. We announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our Gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI. Together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out-of-the-box use cases for AI agents on the Now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints. Customers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise for small single issue resolutions, all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard acknowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB, our new ultrafast database built for AI-first enterprises, which processes transactions 12 times faster, analytics 27 times faster. Customers, including Amadeus, are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB, to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems. Our data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric, which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we can do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real-time secure access to data from source. Workflow Data Fabric also includes zero copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake so customers can turn data into instant AI-powered action, all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services company is Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market. These innovations open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow, nearly doubling our TAM to $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street's to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business. This is why we created ServiceNow University, encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences. ServiceNow University represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands. Even more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors. We also rank our list for best places to work in technology in Europe, in Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind. The best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery, will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO. Amit joins from Alphabet, where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud Platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $4 billion. Before joining Google Cloud, Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle, where he presided over their growth and Platform as a Service and data analytics. With Sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world-class engineer and engineering leader. From commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Bedi, our Chief Customer Officer, who did a great job in filling it in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that we, as a company, also did a great job. In closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning. ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our world forum events are oversubscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year-over-year. By definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge for security. By virtue of our team, our technology and strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go. That not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond. I couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth year anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow with substantial outperformance across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and Gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites, the Now Platform and Now Assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions driving incredible business in every corner of the enterprise. Q3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion, growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion, representing 33% year-over-year constant currency growth, accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Current RPO was $9.36 billion, representing 23.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers. The importance of the Now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more, the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year-over-year, powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including six with new logos. Among them, 15 deals were over $5 million and six deals were over $10 million. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform, and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products. Our GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in Now Assist, including six over $5 million and two over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our Plus SKUs continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over Pro in Q3. With more proof points from real-world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence in Now Assist's ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and HRSD Enterprise Plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work. Another large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self-service by 30% while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI deals were sold direct, so we're starting to see our partner enablement for its results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners, we closed an HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency. In fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter, tripling net new ACV year-over-year led by Financial Services and TMC, which both quadrupled. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 31%, more than 150 basis points above our guidance, driven by the timing of spend, our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 17%, up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.655 billion to $10.66 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, operating margin of 29.5%, free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both the reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the, Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser-focused on delivering a complete end-to-end platform experience. With the Xanadu release marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations yet, we're empowering enterprises to quickly, seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence and we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks. I'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe ask just a market environment demand question first and then a quick follow-up on product. Bill, I mean - or Gina, you called out some unbelievable growth rates from the TMT vertical, from the retail vertical, appreciate that this is a much better year seemingly in those areas versus last year. But maybe are we back to kind of some sort of a steady medium? How do you think about it for the next 12 months, given all the tailwinds that you're seeing? Just maybe a quick tangent on how you're viewing the buying and demand environment if AI is helping you in that or not?\nWilliam McDermott: Well, Alex, thank you very much for the question. I think the overall macro is not dissimilar. It's still a value-based market out there, but it's been a value-based market for some time. And so the question then becomes who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer. And obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter and companies, especially at the C-suite, are building their future plans with real partnerships. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win. And we work for the customer. And the customer feels that and I think culture is something that gets underreported in earnings calls and ours is on fire.\nAlex Zukin: Well, by our calculations just under $90 million and Now Assist ACV, definitely is a real number. So congratulations on that. Maybe just a follow-up. Again, we haven't heard you talk about a product that doubles your TAM in quite a long time. So maybe just help us understand what the incremental opportunity is within your existing customers with this new data platform product and how you expect - how long do you expect it to take to kind of start seeing some meaningful traction there and in the P&L?\nWilliam McDermott: Well, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an upsell opportunity across the entire installed base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in. And by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours. So it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world, Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating. And by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process. And this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record, and we've been doing this for some time now. So I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is to data. And so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to in independent research firms, they said, Bill, ServiceNow pulls us off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here. And I am too.\nAlex Zukin: Excellent. Congratulations guys.\nWilliam McDermott: Thanks a lot Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the meaningful up-tick in headcount additions and OpEx growth in the back half of the year. How much of this should we think of as catch-up for what had been more modest sub-20% growth in OpEx over the past year versus a reflection of the opportunity you see ahead and anything else you can share on the expected pace of investment beyond Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Great question, Brad. So we've told you in the past that we were going to up-tick our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota-bearing reps. And so absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We are planning to continue to accelerate our headcount growth. But remember, we do it prudently. We do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different. And so you can expect similar levels of headcount growth in the next few quarters, as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with everything Now Assist, with the Agentic AI, with the workflow data fabric, all innovation that the team is driving. Not only is sales and marketing headcount up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks for that Gina. And if I could just slip in one more for Bill because I'm dying to ask them, Bill, you've mentioned multiple times now, something that I think for some go in one year and not the other, but that's elite-level execution. You're clearly out-executing others, can you shed light on how you do it, how durable it is and what you might say to skeptics concerned that we're going to begin to lap the strong execution or that there may be some pay-to-piper moment were you risk reverting to the mean of the more average execution levels of so many other companies. Thank you so much and congrats.\nWilliam McDermott: Well, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you've got to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders. And I have the best leadership team in the industry, a hard stop, and we just made that even stronger with Amit. And I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they were total class and this was done in a highly transparent wonderful way, and that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud Platform and ServiceNow. I feel like that's a necessary thing. And I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people. We actually participate in building our plans together and then we overcommunicate everything. And then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything and their professional careers, you can build a defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. Now we're not even close to hitting our peak. We're not going near it. So as you think about lapping ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the board and get more results, but all those things are in flight, and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch. And I do want to thank my partners out there. They know our word is good, and they want to be part of ServiceNow. And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise. And by being that, we integrate with everybody. We're open to all the LLMs that are out there. You can even bring your own model. And at the same time, we've integrated with all the systems of record, and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across our magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results not just on productivity, take cost out, but also on a growth level. And I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, it's constant planning, overcommunicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome, Bill. Thank you so much.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Brad.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. I'll give you just one long question. Bill, congrats on everything. Our fieldwork was showing a big ramp-up in your AI bookings in Q3. There were some comments that it could exclude heading into next year. And by the way, I can't believe the Now Assist numbers that you gave, they're just so big. And I happen to see a mention in the media about ServiceNow and CoreWeave, we've investing billions into the U.K. and it included for AI data center. So I'm curious if we should connect the dots to think that this AI inflection point is just getting so material that it's going to drive that kind of investment in specific countries or maybe leads you to work with the GPU as a service providers just to be able to power all your AI agents.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm speaking well of our company, thank you very much. I do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipeline. I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things. And it was great. Mark, you're going to kick on this. We just did a Board meeting, and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup, which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do. And he said to him, Well, let's just assume somebody is going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that sole crush people just know that Now Assist is automatically updating your health care, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most. And you didn't have to touch a single thing. You just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company. And everybody there said, oh, man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we could fix it. And that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we are looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything, and I certainly believe we're well positioned for that.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: I got couple of - [technical difficulty]\nWilliam McDermott: Kash, can you hear me?\nKash Rangan: Oh, can you hear me okay?\nWilliam McDermott: Oh there you are. We missed you, but now we can hear you.\nKash Rangan: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. I'll fire off two questions very quickly, the one - congrats on Bill, first of all. Secondly - that was not a question. Secondly, the data platform, what does that allow ServiceNow to do for its customers that you could make money and generate revenue that you could not do previously. Gina, the strength in RPO 35% besides long-term contracts, what's driving that and finally, congratulations on hiring Amit, I think it's going to be great.\nGina Mastantuono: So Kash, I'll start first on the strength of RPO. It repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter, but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only our portfolio of products getting larger and deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer. And that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth. We have really strong cRPO, but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter-after-quarter and that's testament to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers. And so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the board and that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO, but our RPO number, which is a really strong long-term measure of the health of our business.\nWilliam McDermott: And I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it. RaptorDB, the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster think about bringing next-generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers. So the performance, the speed, the scale, as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts, platform buying. This is quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the Now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations and speed of execution. So all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks, and we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an upsell opportunity for every existing installation across the world for ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that it that people will invest in, but will be well worth it for the benefits they're going to get from it. And this will be an ongoing story as we continue to build it out. But remember one thing, it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass. No other company in the world could do that. And we believe that, that will give us a very exciting position for future growth, and we're super excited. And we're rolling it out now in Q4, and we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Kash.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulation on a great quarter. One question for Gina and one question for Bill. Gina, last quarter, you talked to us about 200 basis points of duration headwind that came from the strong federal business last year. Given that you had such a strong federal quarter this year. I'm assuming those duration - or headwinds don't exist in Q3. So is that correct that you don't have that duration headwind in Q3? And then the question for Bill. Agents kind of came on to the scene in a really big way over the last couple of months. You guys have your new agent solution as well. A lot of people are talking about agents. Does that change like the sales cycle at all about if we're like Now Assist in the Pro Plus SKU now that there's this new sort of technology people are talking about in terms of the agents? Or does it just kind of flow naturally into the conversation?\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does, if you're not yet a ServiceNow customer or you're thinking about Now Assist, it further cements your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future. So not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another upsell opportunity, and we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve almost any task you can possibly think of. And these partnerships that we've established with great companies like NVIDIA and building market-making solutions, for example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out-of-the-box type solution, I think, it is really pretty breathtaking. And at an architectural level, we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third-party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model, so this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster, but also integrate better. As I said many times, 85% of digital transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now everything integrates into one platform, and you turbocharge it with Now Assist in a Agentic AI and you're off to the races.\nGina Mastantuono: And then, Keith, on your question on duration for cRPO from Fed. The mix we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as Fed kind of re-ups, but then you will see continued headwind quarter-over-quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss: Yes. So like on the duration-adjusted basis, Q2 was stronger than what was reported in Q3 didn't really have a duration headwind, but that duration headwind is going to come back into the numbers as we go through the year and get further away from the federal quarter.\nGina Mastantuono: That's exactly correct.\nKeith Weiss: Okay. Perfect.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBrad Sills: Oh great. Thank you so much. A question on headcount here as well, it's pretty remarkable really since the beginning of last year that you're starting to see R&D headcount outpace sales and marketing, historically, that was the opposite, and it looked pretty significant here by almost 2:1 ratio there. So I guess the question is, what does that say about the business? Is the gating factor to growth here really just about your ability to get out more product in categories like AI and some of these newer application categories that you're going after with the platform and less so about hiring the next rep to go win new business and go find that bigger expansion deal. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. I'd say it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quota bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter-bearing sales at a really strong way. There's lots of marketing and sales operations headcount that we were we were building up as scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear. And I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing headcount was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things. With respect to R&D headcount, it's been pretty consistent. It's always been an area of huge focus for us. And certainly, in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that consistently been a place where we have invested and we'll continue to invest. And so from our perspective, headcount growth is always, first and foremost, allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent as well as feed on the street quota-bearing sales hitting road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest problems and you'll continue to see us do just that.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful. Thanks Gena.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Brad,.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hi. Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I know the numbers can bounce a bit, but we've seen - heard the focus on customer workflows and now see the customer and employee workflow segment hit a high at 31% of net new ACV, Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to disrupt the front office there in the prepared remarks. I was hoping you could maybe frame what you're hearing from a demand perspective there for us. And maybe couple that with what the Xanadu release and agent solutions could do to help further that opportunity. Thanks.\nWilliam McDermott: Absolutely. Thank you very much, Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong. And we grew net new ACV over 50%, 5-0 percent, and it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued tracking in the front office has been going on for some time now, but we're getting known for it, and we're winning. We're winning a lot. So it's a healthy adoption of our Pro Plus offering. The industry SKUs are driving things, financial services was out in front for sure, technology and media, absolutely public sector. Technology and Media was over 300% public sector grew over 60% and the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at, it's really amazing from managed services providers to manufacturing, semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies. It's extremely, extremely exciting. And I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity. Just think about reduced time to quote higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero-touch provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that this will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow.\nMichael Turrin: That\u2019s all very clear. Thanks very much.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Maybe I'll direct this to Bill. Bill, I think a lot of your shareholders are pretty confident about how ServiceNow is doing in your enterprise commercial segments. But I'm sure you're aware, there's been a debate over the last two to three months about the federal business, partly because of the issues that you Gina raised with us three months ago that led to the leadership changes, but also in the interim where there's been issues with one of your partners at Carahsoft. I'm wondering if you could hit that - hit those issues head on, maybe give us an update and talk about how confident you are in continued good Fed bookings over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nWilliam McDermott: Sure, Karl. We didn't see any impact in Q3, and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the U.S. federal business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And as I look at the business in Fed, it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic. We had five deals greater than $5 a couple of deals over $20 million, and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. That's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind. I know because I've been there with the U.S. federal government agencies, they're looking for efficiency gains, and they know our software platform does it. They also know the implementations are stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our cooling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive, it's all working for us. And I'm very, very excited about our Gen AI SKUs for our government Community Cloud. As you know, that went generally available recently, it was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal, and we partnered Accenture as a matter of fact, to kick off a 60-day pilot with 1 agency and they ended it early to get into the Gen AI race because it works so well. So everything is thumbs up here, Karl, and I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Good. Nice to hear. Thanks Bill.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you very much for taking my question. So the growth for Now Assist and Pro Plus has obviously been highly impressive. But we've also been hearing about a real up-tick in customers choosing to upgrade from Standard to Pro as an intermediate step towards Gen AI adoption and obviously, that driving ARPU - uplift as well. So Bill, when you look across your installed base, is that something you're seeing quite a bit more of today as compared with three, six, nine months ago to the point where you would expect a second wave with these set of customers going forward?\nWilliam McDermott: Absolutely. I do, Gregg, I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you now add the Now Assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink, because the returns to them are so much greater than any pricing. And we're a very fair company in the way we do things, and it's highly transparent. I see a plus up with that. I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally, because it's such a sensation. People see the clock speed of how the system runs on it, they all want it. And Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic great engineering built into it amazing. We really hit it with our database and our, I would say, first round draft choice team that built this, it's really, really something to behold. So I am feeling extremely good. And the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow, and they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoint, its real products doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited, Gregg.\nGregg Moskowitz: Fantastic. Thank you, Bill.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDerek Wood: Thanks. Bill, really exciting to see this next new chapter of AI with autonomous agents, just wanted to kind of touch on like what technology is coming to market to power these Agentic networks. It sounds like it's from RaptorDB, Data Fabric, zero-copy integration, maybe NVIDIA's NIM advancements with various LOMs. But could you just kind of share the highlights on what is key to unlocking these new autonomous capabilities on the ServiceNow platform and when some of these capabilities are going to be coming GA.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Sure. Well, first of all, I think there's really three areas that that I would highlight for you are my top three, if that helps, just put this into some context. The Gen AI race is one that we're winning, first mover, and we intend to run the table. So Now Assist is the sensation and GenAI on the Now Platform because of the uniqueness of this platform, and its perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts, and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB it really is magnificent. Now you put RaptorDB. So Now Assist is priority one, you put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform, again, if that workflow data platform, which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform, what customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise, structured or unstructured data, to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest TAM and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that, that can be like a major catalyst. And in terms of when the product is coming, they're out. So you got Now Assist in full flight, you've got RaptorDB in full flight, Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now, and it will continue to evolve and be a big part of our future and you have the front office where wins are happening every day, and we're beautifully led there, and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the and the cross-sells cohorts that Gina talked about, and it's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start-up. And that's kind of motion that's running through ServiceNow, now. And tomorrow, when we get to ServiceNow Live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter, I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world.\nDerek Wood: Fantastic. Thanks.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about a lot of like C-level executives, how do they think about like AI as we go into next year in terms of - is that like coming out of the IT budget? Did you do a second budget? And how do you make sure that you kind of continue to gain share in that one? Just kind of talk us through the dynamic you're seeing in your conversations. Thank you.\nWilliam McDermott: Yes. I think the good news - the really good news here, Raimo, is IT budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And we really work hard on studying the world around us. And Gartner expects global IT spending to grow almost 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023. And it expects software to grow at 15%. And the secular tailwinds GenAI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities, and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers focused on digital transformation within the IT budget. It's growing. We're getting more share because clearly, we're gaining share because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about. And we're gaining share. But I also think there is new share to be gained from more investment, and really believe when I talk to the CEOs, IT is clearly their business focus within IT. Gen AI is their number one focus. And they are going to get the money from somewhere. And if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will. So on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around Gen AI. And I also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where is the new money coming from? We had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250-point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache, but there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future. And the future is Now \u2013 N-O-W, no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow. IT, other line item budgets coming in, and of course, the consolidation to a premier platform like this. Incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly. And we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels and how the channels are now leaning in and building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all that says growth.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. Congrats.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you. I will talk fast. Bill, I couldn't help but have my ears perk up a little when you said that Amit has expertise in packaging and pricing. And I was wondering if there's a reason why you called that out specifically, just especially as we think about this big AI boom period for ServiceNow. And related, just how his responsibilities as the President when he comes over and join how will they differ from maybe kind of prior iterations of that role?\nWilliam McDermott: That's a really great question, Samad. How I learned about that was actually in a live interview with Amit. And we talked about his past and everything that he's done, and he called that out as a unique professional, I guess, strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done and I see that as a skill that will help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at. And that's what you always try to do. You always try to hire great human beings, first of all, and he and he is one with a hungry humble heart, has one but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way. In terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer. We need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, build comradery with the best engineering team in the business, which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens, which he has from all of his experiences. So I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring Amit on. And we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places, including Oracle and obviously, Google with the Google Cloud platform. And as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual, it's also good for the company he came from and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of Amit and a conversation that we had. It was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good. And we want to do good because we believe good wins.\nSamad Samana: Exciting times and congrats on all the success to the whole team.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you so much, Samad.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, we will conclude today's conference call. Good bye. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Darren. Good afternoon everyone. I really appreciate you joining today. There's a lot to cover in this latest beat and raise report. I'll focus on five powerful tailwinds that underscore our strong confidence in ServiceNow's growth trajectory. The first is elite level execution. With our Q3 results, we have demonstrated once again ServiceNow's strong execution. We outperformed all top line and profitability metrics. Subscription revenue growth was 22.5% at constant currency, 200 basis points above the high end of our guidance. cRPO was 23.5% at constant currency, 150 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 31%, more than 150 basis points above our guidance. We had 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV. We landed our second largest new logo deal ever and our second customer crossed the $100 million mark in total ACV. Customer adoption of ServiceNow's platform continues to move across the enterprise end to end. For CIOs and their tech teams, ITSM and ITOM were each in at least 15 of our top 20 deals with double-digit deals over $1 million. It's also worth noting that IT asset management was in all of our top 20 deals. Q3 was another strong performance for Security and Risk as they combined for 14 of the top 20 deals with 11 deals that were over $1 million. As we see more opportunity to disrupt the front office, customer workflows had a great Q3 with 15 of the top 20 deals and 17 deals over $1 million. Employee workflows were in 13 of the top 20 with nine deals over $1 million and creative workflow was strong again in 17 of the top 20 with 13 deals over $1 million. Here's the headline. Many companies have struggled to execute in what has been a complex macro environment. ServiceNow has delivered consistently beyond the Rule of 50. We are the benchmark for elite level execution. The second tailwind behind ServiceNow's success is our growing strategic relevance. For years, we've been talking about the mess of the 20th century enterprise systems. Organizations around the world needed a platform to help them clean up that mess, so they can modernize for the AI world, ServiceNow is that chosen strategic platforms. And we integrate with all those other systems, orchestrate the silos into modern workflows and create a consistent consumer-grade user experience. It's important to understand the history here. When public cloud solutions came online as the last secular shift in the enterprise, they created sprawling governance challenges. CIOs at the direction of their CEOs were asked to get things under control, the cost, security and integration. And ServiceNow played that role. Now the C-suite is looking to ServiceNow to prevent another mess with AI. We do see the risk that every vendor's bots and agents will scatter like hornets fleeing the nest and they trust ServiceNow as the governance control tower, which is a privileged position for our platform. This brings me to the third momentum driver. ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With Now Assist we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six over $5 million and two over $10 million, and this continues to be our fastest-growing product ever and an accelerant to our cross-enterprise expansion. In Q3, we announced our biggest gen AI release to date, Xanadu. This included over 350 net new innovations delivered through 5 million-plus engineering hours. Xanadu has supercharged Now Assist with analytics generation, custom skills development, Microsoft CoPilot integration and more. Xanadu expanded industry vertical AI-powered automation for telco, tech, public sector, banking, insurance and manufacturing. We released Now Assist with security, procurement and an integrated development solution for software engineers. Xanadu showcased ServiceNow's leadership with Agentic AI. And until now, generative AI and the enterprise require human prompts to initiate action. We're now deploying autonomous AI agents that work with people, not just for them. Using ServiceNow single architecture platform and cross enterprise data, ServiceNow AI agents can uniquely advance beyond pro-based activity to deep contextual comprehension. This is like hiring an additional workforce to support people by doing the jobs they've never wanted to do in the first place. We intend to be the control point that governs the deployment of Agentic AI across enterprise. As this AI innovation on ServiceNow contributes to what IDC says will be a nearly $20 trillion global impact by 2030. That means every $1 spent on AI solutions and services will generate nearly $5 in value to the global economy. This is why IDC also forecast businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on AI in 2027 alone. So when you combine a massive once-in-a-generation technological shift with a platform that is engineered to lead the transformation ServiceNow's momentum is the result. The fourth factor is our growing brand awareness and addressable market. When you consider the countless success stories, the world works with ServiceNow was a prescient identity for our brand. The Defense Logistics Agency works with ServiceNow Assist to digitally transform, following a highly successful citizen development project, Banco do Brasil works with ServiceNow to increase visibility and automation. The Veteran Affairs IT office works with ServiceNow to ensure their mission-critical systems perform with minimal disruptions to the veterans, their families and the employees who serve them. Lloyds Banking Group works with ServiceNow to transform its people operations with AI-powered solutions to improve its colleague experience. After rolling out Now Assist globally, EY works ServiceNow to automate a wide range of tasks, to deliver faster resolutions or enhanced client service. The American Red Cross works with ServiceNow to automate risk management so they can concentrate on their life-saving mission. Mercedes Benz works with ServiceNow to support their business transformation. It's no surprise our partnerships are expanding as well. Siemens in ServiceNow announced a new collaboration aimed at enhancing industrial cybersecurity driving the integration of Gen AI into shop floor operations. Bill Canada recently announced the acquisition of HGC Technologies, a ServiceNow partner to increase their leadership in the North American marketplace. We announced an expanded strategic alliance with Zoom to integrate our Gen AI technologies, and we're just getting started. In fact, today, we unveiled a series of powerful new growth initiatives. Our partnership with NVIDIA has been a game changer for enterprises embracing AI. We're taking that to the next level by co-creating a shared vision on Agentic AI. Together, NVIDIA and ServiceNow are developing out-of-the-box use cases for AI agents on the Now platform using NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints. Customers simply turn on these capabilities and start reinventing workflows across the enterprise for small single issue resolutions, all the way to entire incident response workflows. You heard acknowledge that ServiceNow launched RaptorDB, our new ultrafast database built for AI-first enterprises, which processes transactions 12 times faster, analytics 27 times faster. Customers, including Amadeus, are already in the process of implementing RaptorDB, to supercharge processing speeds across their global systems. Our data ambition doesn't end there. We are expanding deeper with our new workflow data fabric, which will unify business and technology data, so it flows seamlessly across the enterprise. Companies have always trusted us to bring order to the chaos of 20th century enterprise architectures. Now we can do the same with their data by powering automation and AI with real-time secure access to data from source. Workflow Data Fabric also includes zero copy partnerships with established leaders like Databricks and Snowflake so customers can turn data into instant AI-powered action, all on the ServiceNow platform. One of the world's leading professional services company is Cognizant became the first systems integrator taking workflow data fabric to market. These innovations open the door to massive market opportunity for ServiceNow, nearly doubling our TAM to $0.5 trillion. We also announced a partnership with Rimini Street's to unlock value in the existing ERP market for net new innovation, digital growth and scale. All this momentum is creating an even bigger flywheel for our business. This is why we created ServiceNow University, encompassing all ServiceNow learning experiences. ServiceNow University represents a strategic investment in the global workforce with the goal to skill another 3 million learners in the next few years. With all this momentum, it's no surprise that our recognition is also growing. The American Opportunity Index assesses how well employers develop their talent. We have learned that ServiceNow will be the highest ranking technology company again this year, ranking fifth overall among 400 brands. Even more importantly, when it comes to internal advancement as measured by the index, how well we promote and build the careers of our people. ServiceNow is the top company overall with the best score among all firms across all sectors. We also rank our list for best places to work in technology in Europe, in Singapore for women and for parents, which is why we have already more than 1.5 million candidates for our open roles this year. This brings me to the final tailwind. The best people want to be at ServiceNow. I'm very proud to announce that Amit Zavery, will join ServiceNow as our President, Chief Product Officer and COO. Amit joins from Alphabet, where he was General Manager of the Google Cloud Platform. During his tenure, he helped build Google Cloud into the fourth largest enterprise software company by increasing annualized revenue from $7 billion to over $4 billion. Before joining Google Cloud, Amit had a distinguished career at Oracle, where he presided over their growth and Platform as a Service and data analytics. With Sterling educational and career credentials, Amit is a world-class engineer and engineering leader. From commercialization perspective, he's also an expert in packaging and pricing. With a compelling vision for AI business transformation, he is hungry and humble to his core. He joins an exemplar engineering leadership team that is full of highly accomplished innovators. I'd like to warmly welcome Amit and all our new hires who have joined the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I'd also like to give a special shout out to Mr. Chris Bedi, our Chief Customer Officer, who did a great job in filling it in Q3 and aligning our whole company with our partners and customers to ensure that we, as a company, also did a great job. In closing, I could have focused on any number of factors that make ServiceNow the standout growth company it is today. There's a lot of speculation out there about which companies will be the winners in AI. We shouldn't look past the companies that are already winning. ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our world forum events are oversubscribed in some cases, more than double the attendance year-over-year. By definition, a safe haven is a place of refuge for security. By virtue of our team, our technology and strategic choices, no company is more closely aligned to where our customers need to go. That not only makes us a safe haven for customers, it also fuels our rocket ship to hit new milestones as we grow to $30 billion and beyond. I couldn't be more proud to celebrate my fifth year anniversary as CEO and to redouble my commitment to serving Fred Luddy's dream for the full potential of ServiceNow. Thank you all very much for your time. I hand things over to Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. Well, Alex, thank you very much for the question. I think the overall macro is not dissimilar. It's still a value-based market out there, but it's been a value-based market for some time. And so the question then becomes who's really got the innovation, who's really got the platform and who's really got real GenAI to tell a real use case story that delivers for the customer. And obviously, I think we answered that definitively with yet another beat and raise. So I feel like the market is really excited about AI. It's going from experimentation to actually choosing the platforms that matter and companies, especially at the C-suite, are building their future plans with real partnerships. So I'm super excited. Our pipelines are great. The global events that we're holding are double subscribed compared to last year. Our team is fired up and we're really ready to win. And we work for the customer. And the customer feels that and I think culture is something that gets underreported in earnings calls and ours is on fire. Well, I think first and foremost, just dealing with RaptorDB alone, rolling that out to the customer base with the RaptorDB Pro version is an upsell opportunity across the entire installed base of ServiceNow. So it's kind of a simple sale. It's like you want to go 25% faster, put RaptorDB in. And by the way, with the greatest engineers in the industry, it's a seamless process and it happens in hours. So it's pretty fascinating to see the executional excellence of this engineering leadership team. They know I love and admire them. But as I see the world, Alex, we have this idea of the workflow automation platform that's evolved into the AI platform for business transformation. But the data part of this is super exciting because we can now access data from any source and then align that perfectly with the workflow that we are automating. And by doing that and making everything go faster, the customer is getting all of that structured and unstructured data under control in an automated workflow or an automated process. And this has magnificent benefits. You saw the announcement that we made with Databricks and Snowflake. But clearly, we've always been able to access the data and all the systems of record, and we've been doing this for some time now. So I think the data fabric element should be thought of a lot like workflow was to applications. The data workflow fabric is to data. And so if you talk to the analysts that I've been talking to in independent research firms, they said, Bill, ServiceNow pulls us off, you just doubled your TAM. So that's exactly where the numbers come from two independent sources that are really psyched up by what we're building here. And I am too. Thanks a lot Alex. Well, thank you very much, Brad. Well, the first thing you've got to do in business is make sure you hire great people and great leaders. And I have the best leadership team in the industry, a hard stop, and we just made that even stronger with Amit. And I do want to give a shout out back to Google and Sundar and Thomas, they were total class and this was done in a highly transparent wonderful way, and that would only strengthen the relationship between Google Cloud Platform and ServiceNow. I feel like that's a necessary thing. And I just want to virtually shake hands on a really class set of people there at Google, really wonderful people. And if enough people care, we have a very clear plan here. It's highly thought of by people. We actually participate in building our plans together and then we overcommunicate everything. And then ultimately, the execution really comes down to wanting it more. And if you get 26,000 people that want to win more than anything and their professional careers, you can build a defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. Now we're not even close to hitting our peak. We're not going near it. So as you think about lapping ourselves and getting caught up in the hype of our own elite level execution, there's plenty of things we can do better. There's plenty of people that still have to get on the board and get more results, but all those things are in flight, and that gives me such optimism about what we've yet to do as we look into the future and now to build this unbelievable platform with this net new innovation on top, it's just going to unleash the will of this company in a way that is just super stunning to watch. And I do want to thank my partners out there. They know our word is good, and they want to be part of ServiceNow. And I think Jensen says it best. He says we're the AI operating system for the enterprise. And by being that, we integrate with everybody. We're open to all the LLMs that are out there. You can even bring your own model. And at the same time, we've integrated with all the systems of record, and it's an opportunity for customers to think about using AI across our magic platform that does amazing things to improve business results not just on productivity, take cost out, but also on a growth level. And I think when I look at our great customer service management leadership and how we're going to help companies grow again, it gets people internally excited because they know the world needs to grow again and with our CSM leadership and solutions we're going to keep going. So it's constant innovation, it's constant planning, overcommunicating and getting everybody involved in the pitch. Thank you very much, Brad. Yes. Well, first of all, thank you so much for your kind words, Mark, I really appreciate it. And then it means a lot to everybody hearing you representing such a great firm speaking well of our company, thank you very much. I do believe that the best days of growth are far in front of us. I see that in the pipeline. I see that at the C-suite, both in the public and the private sector. And now once we have so many referenceable customers that are doing real things. And it was great. Mark, you're going to kick on this. We just did a Board meeting, and Fred Luddy was at the labor cup, which we sponsored and he said there were a few people that didn't know what we do. And he said to him, Well, let's just assume somebody is going out on maternity leave and having to fill out all those crazy forms and go through all these internal processes and corporations that sole crush people just know that Now Assist is automatically updating your health care, your compensation and all the benefits that you rely on most. And you didn't have to touch a single thing. You just can have a nice experience as a worker in any company. And everybody there said, oh, man, you guys do that. It's like whatever you can imagine that's wearing people out, we could fix it. And that's the beauty of this. So I think that what you're looking for is also what we are looking for, which is that inflection point where the AI gear kicks into higher demand for everything, and I certainly believe we're well positioned for that. Thank you. Kash, can you hear me? Oh there you are. We missed you, but now we can hear you. And I will talk about this amazing workflow data fabric. So think of it this way in terms of the monetization of it. RaptorDB, the Pro version delivers enormous value for our customers. So think about improving transaction times by up to 53% and running reports and analytics 27 times faster think about bringing next-generation performance and scale to ServiceNow customers. So the performance, the speed, the scale, as we get bigger, the customer installs get bigger. Gina talked about all the cohorts, platform buying. This is quite a fascinating thing to see. Then think about enabling enterprises to unify disparate data and then apply the power of the Now AI platform for business transformation to drive productivity, improve operations and speed of execution. So all of this is driving performance for the customer and the migrations take hours, not days or weeks, and we have truly perfected that. So this is going to be an upsell opportunity for every existing installation across the world for ServiceNow. And to get that enhanced benefit, there will be pieces of it that it that people will invest in, but will be well worth it for the benefits they're going to get from it. And this will be an ongoing story as we continue to build it out. But remember one thing, it's pretty unique to be able to access any data regardless of the source, whether it's structured or unstructured and to compose that a data platform that perfectly coincides with the work, how it flows and what you're trying to automate on one common pane of glass. No other company in the world could do that. And we believe that, that will give us a very exciting position for future growth, and we're super excited. And we're rolling it out now in Q4, and we already have great companies like Amadeus that have adopted RaptorDB and we're counting on hundreds more. Thank you very much, Kash. Thank you very much, Keith. It flows naturally. It's yet another advancement in the ServiceNow innovation story. And I think it does, if you're not yet a ServiceNow customer or you're thinking about Now Assist, it further cements your resolve that ServiceNow is one of maybe a handful of platforms that companies are going to bet on for the future. So not disruptive, totally complementary and yet another upsell opportunity, and we intend to do very well with it. And I think a lot of people will benefit from ServiceNow agents working together with each other and with humans to proactively and predictively resolve almost any task you can possibly think of. And these partnerships that we've established with great companies like NVIDIA and building market-making solutions, for example, taking on some of the enterprise security challenges that have existed out there for years and years on an out-of-the-box type solution, I think, it is really pretty breathtaking. And at an architectural level, we don't have to try to translate between our GenAI models and some third-party system, which most people have to since everything is on one platform with one architecture and one data model, so this has given us an opportunity to innovate faster, but also integrate better. As I said many times, 85% of digital transformation ROI never came to for our customers because they couldn't integrate those old systems. Now everything integrates into one platform, and you turbocharge it with Now Assist in a Agentic AI and you're off to the races. Absolutely. Thank you very much, Michael. As I said, customer workflows were in 15 of the top 20 deals and it was very, very strong. And we grew net new ACV over 50%, 5-0 percent, and it's fantastic performance by our industry SKUs and the continued tracking in the front office has been going on for some time now, but we're getting known for it, and we're winning. We're winning a lot. So it's a healthy adoption of our Pro Plus offering. The industry SKUs are driving things, financial services was out in front for sure, technology and media, absolutely public sector. Technology and Media was over 300% public sector grew over 60% and the front office, our sales and order management product has demonstrated significant traction, significant traction. And I'm serious, it's like every industry you look at, it's really amazing from managed services providers to manufacturing, semiconductors, medical devices, chemicals, public sector agencies. It's extremely, extremely exciting. And I think the idea of our value proposition comes down to sales productivity. Just think about reduced time to quote higher deal sizes, lower fulfillment time, a zero-touch provisioning, optimizing for customer lifetime value. All this is resonating with the market in a big, big way. And I have a feeling that this will end up being the biggest business in ServiceNow. Thank you. Sure, Karl. We didn't see any impact in Q3, and we're currently not involved in any issues regarding Carahsoft with the U.S. federal business. So you should just take that one off of any concern list that you might have. And as I look at the business in Fed, it could not possibly be stronger. The net new ACV growth is fantastic. We had five deals greater than $5 a couple of deals over $20 million, and ServiceNow has become the standard platform for federal agencies as they're looking to consolidate contracts and standardize on a single vendor to drive digital transformation. That's the bandwidth that's built into this platform. So as I think about where we're going now, GenAI is top of mind. I know because I've been there with the U.S. federal government agencies, they're looking for efficiency gains, and they know our software platform does it. They also know the implementations are stellar and the referenceability is fantastic. And so I think getting things done quickly, which is one of our cooling cards, giving people great experiences that really make them happy and more productive, it's all working for us. And I'm very, very excited about our Gen AI SKUs for our government Community Cloud. As you know, that went generally available recently, it was actually in June, and we saw great traction on it with federal, and we partnered Accenture as a matter of fact, to kick off a 60-day pilot with 1 agency and they ended it early to get into the Gen AI race because it works so well. So everything is thumbs up here, Karl, and I'm very grateful for the question. Thank you. Thank you so much. Absolutely. I do, Gregg, I expect a nice second wave, Pro is still doing extremely well. When you now add the Now Assist and the premium on top of that, customers don't even blink, because the returns to them are so much greater than any pricing. And we're a very fair company in the way we do things, and it's highly transparent. I see a plus up with that. I see a plus up with RaptorDB globally, because it's such a sensation. People see the clock speed of how the system runs on it, they all want it. And Paul is now rolling that out globally in Q4. We'll see how it goes, but we're highly optimistic great engineering built into it amazing. We really hit it with our database and our, I would say, first round draft choice team that built this, it's really, really something to behold. So I am feeling extremely good. And the customer relationship, the focus and intensity around those relationships, if you come to our building in Santa Clara, it's a revolving door CEOs are flying in from all over the world. So I'm not suggesting that they don't stop other places too, but they definitely don't miss stopping in ServiceNow, and they kind of tell me that at the end of it, what they see from our team and our product is not PowerPoint, its real products doing real things with a real value proposition. So I'm really excited, Gregg. Thank you so much. Yes. Sure. Well, first of all, I think there's really three areas that that I would highlight for you are my top three, if that helps, just put this into some context. The Gen AI race is one that we're winning, first mover, and we intend to run the table. So Now Assist is the sensation and GenAI on the Now Platform because of the uniqueness of this platform, and its perfection in the way it was engineered and the fact that we never took any shortcuts, and we always protected the single platform with the single architecture, the single CMDB it really is magnificent. Now you put RaptorDB. So Now Assist is priority one, you put RaptorDB and you build out the workflow data platform, again, if that workflow data platform, which is already in flight connects to the workflow automation platform, what customer wouldn't want to connect to any data source in their enterprise, structured or unstructured data, to drive their workflow performance to get a business outcome. I literally couldn't pick one out of a lineup. And then you say, what else are you going to do? And it's really the front office, everything else is still going full pace, but the front office is getting a step function increase in terms of its focus and the innovation and the execution because it's the biggest TAM and because we're winning everywhere we go, we think that, that can be like a major catalyst. And in terms of when the product is coming, they're out. So you got Now Assist in full flight, you've got RaptorDB in full flight, Q4 will be a big quarter for that. You got the workflow data platform, which I explained, which works now, and it will continue to evolve and be a big part of our future and you have the front office where wins are happening every day, and we're beautifully led there, and we've got amazing dreams and then take all the core stuff with the upsells and the and the cross-sells cohorts that Gina talked about, and it's just so much in front of us, we feel like a scale company with the heart of a start-up. And that's kind of motion that's running through ServiceNow, now. And tomorrow, when we get to ServiceNow Live, which is an iconic cultural event that we do every quarter, I could just imagine the seats are going to be rumbling all over the world. Thank you very much. Appreciate the question, Derek. Thank you. Yes. I think the good news - the really good news here, Raimo, is IT budgets continue to grow. So the digital strategy has been and will continue to be the business strategy. And we really work hard on studying the world around us. And Gartner expects global IT spending to grow almost 10.5% next year. And that's double what it was in 2023. And it expects software to grow at 15%. And the secular tailwinds GenAI and workflow automation are clear C-suite priorities, and we're the best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. So I think it's clear to me that customers focused on digital transformation within the IT budget. It's growing. We're getting more share because clearly, we're gaining share because we're growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market, which I talked about. And we're gaining share. But I also think there is new share to be gained from more investment, and really believe when I talk to the CEOs, IT is clearly their business focus within IT. Gen AI is their number one focus. And they are going to get the money from somewhere. And if they have to take it out of another line item to fuel this, they will. So on top of IT, I think there will be money coming from other departments, especially back office functions that will be put to the front of the line around Gen AI. And I also see a consolidation effect taking place. People say to me, where is the new money coming from? We had one company recently that basically took ServiceNow by consolidating 250-point solutions that the light was so dim on, it really gave you a headache, but there's hundreds and hundreds of accounts like that all over the world that just need to really think about what they want for their future. And the future is Now \u2013 N-O-W, no pun intended. But I think that all of that is goodness for ServiceNow. IT, other line item budgets coming in, and of course, the consolidation to a premier platform like this. Incidentally, the partner ecosystem is grabbing on to ServiceNow in a way that I have never seen before and it's accelerating quickly. And we just got done with a Board meeting where our team presented some of these dynamics and the expansion of the channels and how the channels are now leaning in and building on top of and around ServiceNow in ways they never did before. And I just think all that says growth. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. That's a really great question, Samad. How I learned about that was actually in a live interview with Amit. And we talked about his past and everything that he's done, and he called that out as a unique professional, I guess, strength, but it was also he went into scenario planning and different things that he's done and I see that as a skill that will help us tremendously. Really, it's a net new add on to what I think we're good at. And that's what you always try to do. You always try to hire great human beings, first of all, and he and he is one with a hungry humble heart, has one but also has domain expertise in areas that expand the bandwidth of what ServiceNow is all about. And so in terms of his focus, and I did call it out deliberately, by the way. In terms of his focus, he's an engineer's engineer. We need an absolute thought leader that loves product, loves working with great engineers, build comradery with the best engineering team in the business, which we have and invent new growth shoots and new opportunities by seeing things through a broad lens, which he has from all of his experiences. So I just think that it was a wonderful opportunity to bring Amit on. And we always are very respectful of this because he's had great careers in other places, including Oracle and obviously, Google with the Google Cloud platform. And as I said earlier, I do really respect that when you get a great individual, it's also good for the company he came from and all the relationships that he brought with him and that was part of the ethos of Amit and a conversation that we had. It was a deeply thoughtful person and a person that wants to do good. And we want to do good because we believe good wins. Thank you so much, Samad."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q3 was another stellar quarter for ServiceNow with substantial outperformance across all of our growth and profitability metrics as digital transformation and Gen AI remain top priorities for C-suites, the Now Platform and Now Assist continue to see robust demand. ServiceNow stands out as the strategic partner to deliver intelligent solutions driving incredible business in every corner of the enterprise. Q3 subscription revenues were $2.715 billion, growing 22.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range by 200 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $19.5 billion, representing 33% year-over-year constant currency growth, accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Current RPO was $9.36 billion, representing 23.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 150 basis point beat versus our guidance and a 100 basis point acceleration from Q2. From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was very strong, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Retail and Hospitality also had a fantastic quarter, growing over 80% year-over-year. Health care and life sciences and manufacturing also saw strength. Year-to-date, U.S. Federal has demonstrated outstanding execution, further growing net new ACV on top of a phenomenal 2023. In Q3, we landed five deals over $5 million and two over $20 million. Overall, we once again achieved a robust renewal rate in the quarter reflecting the value ServiceNow consistently provides to customers. The importance of the Now platform has driven the number of customers paying us over $1 million in ACV to 2020. What's more, the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew nearly 40% year-over-year, powered by large deal momentum. We closed 96 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including six with new logos. Among them, 15 deals were over $5 million and six deals were over $10 million. The proliferation of large deal reflects a greater emphasis on selling the platform, and with it, more products per transaction. In Q3, 18 of our top 20 deals included seven or more products. Our GenAI capabilities also continue to gain commercial traction in the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we now have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in Now Assist, including six over $5 million and two over $10 million. Pricing has also remained healthy as our Plus SKUs continue to see a greater than 30% price uplift over Pro in Q3. With more proof points from real-world case studies, we're seeing rising demand from customers increasing confidence in Now Assist's ability to deliver significant productivity improvements and savings. For instance, a multinational conglomerate has seen a 75% improvement in case deflection rates with ITSM and HRSD Enterprise Plus, pushing towards its goal of automating 60% of transactional work. Another large tech company adopted ITSM Enterprise Plus to increase self-service by 30% while enhancing employee satisfaction. The majority of GenAI deals were sold direct, so we're starting to see our partner enablement for its results. For example, in Q3, with the help of one of our largest GSI partners, we closed an HRSD Enterprise Plus deal with a federal agency. In fewer than 60 days, they were fully configured and production ready. Our industry SKUs also had a phenomenal quarter, tripling net new ACV year-over-year led by Financial Services and TMC, which both quadrupled. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 31%, more than 150 basis points above our guidance, driven by the timing of spend, our top line outperformance and OpEx efficiencies. Our free cash flow margin was 17%, up over 800 basis points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $9.1 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 272,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $562 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance, given the Q3 outperformance, we are further raising our 2024 growth outlook. For 2024, we're raising our subscription revenues by $78 million at the midpoint to a range of $10.655 billion to $10.66 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth or 22.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, operating margin of 29.5%, free cash flow margin of 31% and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $2.875 billion and $2.88 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 21.5% on both the reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q3 was another spectacular quarter driven by strong demand for the, Now platform and exceptional team execution. ServiceNow continues to be laser-focused on delivering a complete end-to-end platform experience. With the Xanadu release marking our most comprehensive set of new AI innovations yet, we're empowering enterprises to quickly, seamlessly and responsibly harness the power of intelligence and we're in great company with strong partners like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Snowflake and Databricks. I'm excited about the opportunities created by our latest innovations as they fuel our durable top line growth and margin expansion on our journey to becoming the defining enterprise software company of 21st century. Bill and I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our employees worldwide for their continued hard work and dedication. Our people are our greatest strength. Their commitment to elite level execution has positioned ServiceNow among the best places to work globally. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Great question, Brad. So we've told you in the past that we were going to up-tick our headcount growth in the back half, right? The vast majority of the sales and marketing hiring is quota-bearing reps. And so absolutely, you can think about that as our confidence in the opportunity that we see in front of us. We are planning to continue to accelerate our headcount growth. But remember, we do it prudently. We do it a quarter at a time, so that we're able to pivot if we see something different. And so you can expect similar levels of headcount growth in the next few quarters, as we lean into the opportunity we see in front of us with everything Now Assist, with the Agentic AI, with the workflow data fabric, all innovation that the team is driving. Not only is sales and marketing headcount up, but our R&D head count has been consistently up and will continue to be at similar pace. So Kash, I'll start first on the strength of RPO. It repeats itself. So it's better than last quarter, but remains consistently strong. And that's really a testament to the fact that our customers are leaning in much more strategically with us and not only our portfolio of products getting larger and deal size is getting larger, but the contract terms are getting longer and longer. And that's really what's driving that incredible RPO growth. We have really strong cRPO, but that RPO growth when our average contract terms continue to move up is why you see that continuing to strengthen quarter-after-quarter and that's testament to the incremental strategic relevance that we have with our customers. And so really proud of all the results that execution elite level across the board and that's showing not only in our revenues and our cRPO, but our RPO number, which is a really strong long-term measure of the health of our business. And then, Keith, on your question on duration for cRPO from Fed. The mix we had another great quarter beat expectations from our perspective, but the mix hasn't changed significantly. So Q3, that duration definitely goes away as Fed kind of re-ups, but then you will see continued headwind quarter-over-quarter in Q1, Q2 until we get back to Q3 of next year. Does that make sense? That's exactly correct. Thanks, Keith. Yes. I'd say it's a couple of things, right? So sales and marketing, there's a lot of stuff in there, right? So it's not only quota bearing sales. So just because you saw total sales and marketing not growing as fast as R&D, it doesn't mean that we weren't growing our feet on the street quarter-bearing sales at a really strong way. There's lots of marketing and sales operations headcount that we were we were building up as scaling that now we're not increasing at the same level. So I want to be clear. And I've said this each quarter just because it looked like sales and marketing headcount was a little bit lighter. That's the leverage as we're scaling, especially on the operational side of things. With respect to R&D headcount, it's been pretty consistent. It's always been an area of huge focus for us. And certainly, in the age of AI and all of the innovation that our incredible engineering team has been focused on that consistently been a place where we have invested and we'll continue to invest. And so from our perspective, headcount growth is always, first and foremost, allocated to incredible engineering R&D talent as well as feed on the street quota-bearing sales hitting road, hitting the streets, working with our customers to solve their biggest problems and you'll continue to see us do just that. Thanks, Brad,."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2024 ServiceNow Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Darren Yip, Group Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDarren Yip: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will review our second quarter 2024 results and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2023 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you, Darren, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. By now you've all seen the press release, we crushed the quarter, we raised the full year guidance, and we've never been more excited about the future of ServiceNow. But before we get into all the details, I just want to comment on the leadership announcements we made today. The company received an internal complaint earlier this year regarding the hiring of an individual who had previously been a U.S. government employee. As you would expect, we took the complaint very seriously. The Board of Directors conducted a thorough internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel and determined that our company policy was violated. Acting with total transparency, the company proactively disclose the findings of the investigation to the proper government entities. And as a result, today, we're announcing the departure of the individual who's hiring was the subject of the original complaint. We also came to a mutual agreement that CJ Desai, our President and COO, would offer his resignation from the company effective immediately. While we believe this was an isolated incident, we are further sharpening our hiring policies and procedures as a result of the situation. And when it comes to compliance, let me be perfectly clear, we are fully committed to doing the right thing. And from a continuity standpoint, I'm extremely proud that our team has the incredible depth of talent and expertise to lead forward without any disruption. In fact, Chris Bedi, a respective ServiceNow executive for the past decade, who was recently named the MIT Sloan CIO Leadership Award winner for 2024. He'll serve as the interim Chief Product Officer, while I consider internal and external candidates alike. Our entire products and engineering team is the best in the enterprise software industry, and they're focused on delivering our Xanadu release in a few weeks' time. In fact, I just got done talking with them. They're in great shape. And we wanted to give you the facts as clearly and succinctly as possible because we have so much else to cover today. So as I said at the start, ServiceNow is once again in a beat and raise situation. Our Q2 results prove that we are delivering elite level execution. Subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year at constant currency, which is 100 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO grew 22.5% at constant currency, which is 200 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 27%, nearly 250 basis points above our guidance and we had 88 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, up from 70% a year ago, a 26% year-over-year increase. A year ago, Q2 had one deal greater than 1 million from a net new logo perspective. This year, we had six of them that were net new logos. Our first federal customer actually crossed the 100 million plus ACV threshold, and we signed our third largest net new AC deal ever. All of our workflow businesses were in more than one-half of our top 20 deals. Security and Risk, ITSM and ITOM had eight, nine and 10 deals over 1 million, respectively. Customer workflows had a big Q2 with 14 deals over 1 million, employee workflows had 12 deals over 1 million and creator had 10 deals over 1 million. What's the headline? ServiceNow is relevance is the AI platform for business transformation is soaring. This is a growth company on an unprecedented trajectory. Moving to the topic of AI. NowAssist net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter, significantly overachieving our expectations and it became the fastest growing new product in the company's history. We signed 11 NowAssist deals with 1 million plus NACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million. We had impressive wins across industries, from banking, health care and manufacturing to semis, tech and many others. As an AI lighthouse customer, Stellantis is using ServiceNow. As its strategic AI platform to manage operations across HR, finance and supply chain. American Honda selected NowAssist as their Gen AI solution of choice to improve deflection and efficiency of service, delivering a world class experience to their employees. Merck is using the ServiceNow platform to streamline operations across IT and cybersecurity to advance its global biopharmaceutical business. Adobe will leverage NowAssist to optimize routine tasks for employees, which will increase efficiency across the entire organization. Dell will integrate NowAssist with its service capabilities to deliver a seamless customer and employee experience and with NowAssist, ST Microelectronics plans to enhance productivity and user experiences across their entire organization. LTIMindtree is using NowAssist for ITSM to increase developer productivity by 30% with code and flow generation. We're also collaborating together to grow and expand offerings in finance and supply chain workflows. So why are so many enterprises rapidly adopting ServiceNow's Gen AI strategy? Think about this in the context of design thinking and innovation. The first pillar is always desirability. Do we have the big idea? ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our Gen AI strategy is focused on infusing intelligence into the flow of work, end-to-end across the enterprise, every department, every persona. With our native integrations, we already help people orchestrate across different systems and data sources. Now we can train the machines to do the low value work so the people can up level to the knowledge work. The second pillar is viability, does our approach to Gen AI make business sense? We set the tone on innovating with domain specific multimodal language models. This approach is more accurate. It doesn't have the hallucinations of the large models from the Internet. It's faster to train, and it's faster to deploy these models. It's more cost effective and sustainable because these models are less GPU hungry than public models. The final pillar is feasibility. Can we actually do it? This is the best pillar of all for ServiceNow because we've actually done it. When you look at our own deployment of NowAssist, the initial results are staggering. With better deflection, our IT help desk is saving 45 minutes per avoided case and customer service. Our colleagues are saving 30 minutes every time the computer generates the knowledge based article for them. Our employees will save 21,000 hours with faster self-service and our developers are completing non-complex scripts and half the time. This is a moment where business leaders are looking for the role model. What does it look like to run a business with Gen AI at the core? ServiceNow. Thanks to our engineering and our Now on Now teams is leading the way. This is an excitement for Gen AI. And it's one recent Gartner forecast global IT spending will be up 8.9% in 2024 and that's even higher than originally forecasted. By the way, more than 3 times GDP. Within software spend according to IDC, Software-as-a-Service will grow 17%. So the trend line is clear. Enterprise software buyers are moving away from consolidating the past into building for the AI future. ServiceNow has been the modernizer at many points on this journey, creating a single pane of glass into the IT estate. Expanding our core from IT to employee service to customer service, now making it easy to build new consumer grade applications on a single data model. The AI moment is the culmination of this journey. CIOs don't want 1,000 points of dim light. They're betting on a few market leading platforms working together as the great unlock. They see ServiceNow as the intelligent action platform spanning the entire enterprise. And that is why our pipeline has built from knowledge over 50% year-over-year improvement. It's why CIO surveys continue to show ServiceNow's relevance rising to the top of the charts. It's why more IT and line of business buyers alike are looking at long-term blueprints for ServiceNow and planning out the future with us. It's why Jensen Wang hit it on the head when he said, ServiceNow is the AI operating system for the enterprise. Customers are seeing us like Jensen sees us. While our performance has been consistently strong, we take nothing for granted. Every aspect of our innovation engine and our go-to-market machine is moving up to the next level. We're tracking and tackling more of the automation and market opportunities every day with both our customers and our engineers. Our new Creator Studio available with ServiceNow App Engine is extending our existing low code leadership to no code. So every employee can now build applications. Other updates to our automation engine help simplify RPA deployments. We see a great opportunity for ServiceNow there. We're moving even faster on co-innovation partnerships with major global brands, an expanded multiyear agreement will extend ServiceNow capabilities to all BT Group units. Bell Canada will develop new capabilities within the business service experience while accelerating their own internal transformation as a tech services and digital media leader. This is the largest telecommunications collaboration for ServiceNow and the first of its kind in Canada. Boomi is expanding from a small ServiceNow footprint to replace existing competitor implementations. Boomi will use all NowAssist solutions and work with us on joint product development. Deloitte is leveraging the ServiceNow platform to drive industry specific managed services to bring AI based innovations to clients around the world. We are accelerating our growth in key geographic markets and verticals. ServiceNow will help the U.S. Air Force adopt new best-in-class technology. The federal government's National Science Foundation is utilizing ServiceNow's new Gen AI solutions to support their mission to promote research, expanding knowledge and science, engineering and education. In Germany, Bayer is using NowAssist to empower their employees with Gen AI and hyper automation as they create a culture, where every employee has the potential to innovate. Our momentum in Japan continues with major wins this quarter, including Nomura, Panasonic Information Systems and Nitori Holdings. We announced plans to launch a ServiceNow UAE cloud hosted on Microsoft Azure, so we can meet the business transformation requirements of all public and private sector entities in the UAE. We announced two growth investments in our partner ecosystem in India. In Morpheus, we'll extend our presence in India and across Southeast Asia through the development of new Gen AI offerings, solutions and digital skills training. Prodapt will further develop digital business transformation through AI enabled solutions and the Now Platform skills expansion. We're also expanding into new categories, further increasing ServiceNow's total addressable market yet again. Industry analysts have reported that the number one priority for CIOs is getting their data house in order. And that's why at knowledge, we shared our plans for a powerful new database offering. RaptorDB, it's built for enterprises looking for speed and scale to support new AI use cases. RaptorDB give ServiceNow customers the capability to ingest data at massive scale from multiple data sources, so they can analyze it much faster to feed our domain specific models. We're already achieving 12x transactional throughput and 27x improvement in response time for analytic inquiries in our ProPlus version of the platform. Today, we're launching the RaptorDB lighthouse program. This is similar to our highly successful Gen AI lighthouse program. This new offering is designed for a select group of top customers at the forefront of this new AI world. We already have many signing up. We also completed a tuck-in acquisition of Raizen, an industry leading data company based in Germany, in combination with NowAssist. Raizen will further accelerate our Gen AI-powered search and knowledge management capabilities. This is only the beginning. The data opportunity is massive, and we intend to make some additional announcements on September 10, regarding our growing data ambition. As you can see, ServiceNow is not opportunity constrained. New buying centers, new industries, new geographic markets and we're fielding more inbound interest for new partnerships that at any point in our history. There's a sense of excitement here in the community, in our company, and it's all for good reason. In closing, our focus is exactly where it should be. Expanding this differentiated platform, scaling this business, and delivering great results for our stakeholders. I've got a few questions about the second half, with a rare speculation out there that elections or other macro factors will challenge the business environment. Are our customers mindful of the unknowns and the broader macro, of course, that's exactly why they are leaning in to ServiceNow. Because AI is the elixir that drives productivity, cost efficiency and new business models. Simply put, Enterprises are investing in business transformation. They are investing in AI. They are building a new reference architecture for the decades to come. This is the largest, most compelling business opportunity in the world. We are bullish on what's ahead. That's why we have not only confirmed, but also raised our full year guidance. Our brand represents an optimistic view of the world's future. It's why we're putting AI to work for people. And ultimately, why? As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Fred Luddy's original dream, we believe the next 20 years will be even more exciting. I personally have never been more convinced that ServiceNow will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your questions. I'll now turn you over to Gina. Gina, over to you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another fantastic quarter with tremendous beats across all of our top line and profitability metrics. ServiceNow's business remains resilient with net new ACV and Gen AI contributions exceeding expectations. Once again, the team demonstrated exceptional execution as we continue to see strong demand for the Now Platform and our NowAssist offerings. Q2 subscription revenues were $2.542 billion, growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $18.6 billion, representing 31.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. We continue to see average contract terms increase with TCV from five plus year deals more than tripling year-over-year. Current RPO was $8.78 billion, representing 22.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 200 basis point beat versus our guidance, and a 150 basis point acceleration from Q1. From an industry perspective, U.S. Federal had a great quarter, accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year with net new ACV up well over 50% from last Q2. Manufacturing and Energy and utilities were also areas of strength, growing net new ACV over 50% year-over-year. Healthcare & Life Sciences and Retail and Hospitality, both had a great quarter, growing about 30% year-over-year. The Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by a strong 98% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to continue to build upon. We closed 88 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, representing 26% growth year-over-year. This includes six new logos, two of which were G2K customers. We continue to see robust large deal momentum in the quarter closing 14 deals over 5 million in net new ACV and four deals over 10 million. Our focus on selling a comprehensive platform continue to drive more multiproduct deals, as 14 of our top 20 deals included eight or more products. We now have 1,988 customers paying us over 1 million in ACV. In addition, the number of customers paying us 20 million or more grew nearly 40% year-over-year. As Bill highlighted, our Gen AI net new ACV to date continues to trend ahead of any new product family launched for the comparable period. Our Plus SKU saw more than a 30% price uplift over Pro in Q2. Furthermore since launch, we're seeing a greater than 3x increase in average deal size versus the comparable Pro upgrade. NowAssist cogeneration capabilities within creative workflows remain a powerful productivity tool of choice as well, appearing in over 70% of our Gen AI deals. Best of all, customers are going live fast. We're learning with them, releasing innovations based on that feedback at a very fast clip to get them to value. In July, BT Group announced that its NowAssist pilot help agents write case summaries and review complex nodes faster, cutting both times by 55%. This helped drive down the average time to resolve cases by a third. We are just scratching the surface of the opportunity as the vast majority of Gen AI sales are direct. We're working to onboard partners, arming them with the tools to sell NowAssist and further extend our go-to-market reach. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 27%, approximately 250 basis points above our guidance, driven by OpEx efficiencies, top line outperformance and timing of marketing spend. Our free cash flow margin was 14%. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $8.9 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. Given our Q2 outperformance, we are raising our 2024 outlook. For 2024, we are raising our subscription revenues by $33 million at the midpoint of the range to more than offset an incremental $20 million FX headwinds. This raise yields a net increase of $13 million on a narrowed range of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion representing 22% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 29% to 29.5%. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, free cash flow margin of 31%, and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $2.660 billion and $2.665 billion, representing 20% to 20.5% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect CRPO growth of 22.5% on a reported basis or 22% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29.5%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter, and we continue to see strength heading into the second half of the year. Our knowledge embed in May was an incredible three days of inspiring keynotes, amazing demos, intriguing breakout sessions and plenty of discussions around AI as it was woven into every aspect of the event. ServiceNow's focus on putting AI to work for people was a consistent theme for the over 20,000 participants, including 5 billion of pipeline in the room. The response from customers around our latest innovation has been incredible. As Bill mentioned, newly created pipeline after only 60 days was up 50% year-over-year and that has since growth over $1 billion. Our second half pipelines combined with our net new ACV outperformance in the first half of '24 gives us very good visibility into our top line guide and further confidence in our journey to $15 billion plus in revenue. We are well on our way to becoming a defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this incredible team. With that, I'll open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter. In an environment that, as you guys noted, a lot of people are concerned about -- Bill, can you talk to us a little bit more about what is it that enables you guys to get these contracts closed, if you will? What we're hearing from a lot of CIOs is, excitement about the opportunity but tentativeness in pulling the trigger, but you guys seem to be able to get people to pull the trigger. What is it that enables you to pull the trigger? And then, a follow-up for Gina. Was there any unusual activity in terms of like, deals slipping from Q1 to Q2 or was this just fundamentally the strength of Q2?\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Keith. I would, first of all, begin by discussing this incredible platform and the difference that it makes. If you take all the complexity that's out there, and you think about what CEOs today want, they're looking for new vectors of growth to have to radically simplify their companies and digitization is really the only way out. But the difficult thing is most people are selling into a department where they have a narrow threaded solution and that doesn't necessarily change the way work flows and the way business processes get executed. So we're able, -- especially with our Gen AI built into this incredible platform, we're able to demonstrate real value, and that ROI is undeniable and we have a culture built to deliver value. We have a team in who knows how to describe value. And obviously, we're very market connected. I do give the culture here credit for what I call an elite level of execution. So that's just built into the fabric of our DNA, great innovation, great execution, great integration between what we build, how we take it to market, and how in the post-sale world, we care for that value to be ultimately delivered quickly and provable ROI.\nGina Mastantuono: And then, Keith, on your question about any unusual activity of deals slipping from Q1 to Q2? No. Actually, we just saw pretty incredible great execution across the board in Q2. From a revenue perspective, net new ACV outperformance that we talked about strong execution of the ServiceNow incredible go-to-market team, as you would expect. On-prem did come in a little bit ahead of expectations, but the net new ACV outperformance was more -- was much more impactful. With respect to the CRPO beat, also, again, primarily driven by net new ACV outperformance, a little bit higher or early renewals. As you know, I\u2019ve been pretty prudent in how I\u2019ve been guiding for early renewals and continue to do so. But the beat was really a function of incredible execution by this team once again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about some of the used cases like BT, where you kind of -- with your slightly smaller, more efficient fast language models are achieving very good results. And is that like a blueprint of the way we think -- we should think about AI going forward in terms of like [indiscernible] very large models that you -- as a small and more nimblest play, actually can do achieve a lot more because you're more specialized. Thank you and congrats.\nWilliam McDermott: Yeah. Raimo, thank you very much for the question. And I think the key to our domain specific or smaller models, as you mentioned it, they're lightning quick. There's no latency because we're working with the customers' data. They are highly secure again because it's the customer's data, and they're inexpensive to run. And when companies see the bandwidth of a platform that goes end-to-end. So everywhere from the entire IT estate for digital transformation, or recreating an employee experience where employees actually get excited to come to work and do their job, because we take the busy work out of their life or the customer experience can be totally reimagined and then inspiring developers to do what they do best, which is dream about net new innovation and building new business models. You see this, obviously, you mentioned BT, I could have easily said London Stock Exchange, where they deployed us for a core business transformation, and they unified 15 siloed platforms and 14 lines of business on the ServiceNow platform. And they actually saw a deflection rates increase to 85% of the cases, and 35% time improved and summarizing incidents. And by the way, NowAssist does this in seconds. So we're talking about two days per employee improvement and productivity. I could have gone to TriMedx. A biotech company and basically, what they're doing NowAssist is they're enhancing developer productivity, which has increased for them 22%, and they saw 50% of their developers actively using NowAssist in just three months. I could have also mentioned Kainos, a digital technology solutions provider. They created 600 knowledge articles with NowAssist and they were able to improve access to their knowledge content for their customers and employees. Their satisfaction from a customer standpoint went from 80 to 99 and this is just amazing stuff. We just went general availability with our Gen AI SKUs for our government Community Cloud. This is June 28, by the way. One customer had a go live in implementation schedule for Q3, but their pilot went so well that they decided, they needed it immediately activated in Q2. So you\u2019re into a whole different program here with rapid time to value a product that people love to use and the executives get excited because their people are so happy. Their customers are so happy. Their innovators are so happy. And we\u2019re so market connected that we know what\u2019s going on in every one of these instances, they know we\u2019re not mailing it in from a deck.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Just amazing. Thank you.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Raimo.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Bill, you'd be the last person to mail it from the desk. That's for sure. Congratulations to the team from amazing results and Gina, I couldn't help but notice that RPO growth overall hit 30% plus for the first time in eight years, so certainly kudos on that front. Bill, one for you. You've been through multiple macro cycles, if there is a rate reduction and there's a regime change for more Pro-business, if you want to call it that way and count the '25. Have there been certain things that have been holding back so much to the extent that you guys have done really, really well. What could be the bigger macro unlocks as we head towards more rate cuts ahead? And also on the AI front, it\u2019s remarkable how much productivity improvement you've been able to give your clients with just three quarters of shipping the product. Where do you see NowAssist go forward? I mean, is it going to follow the path created by employ workflows, customer service workflows, greater workflows. I mean are we going to go deeper into each of these domains and unveil more and more AI unlocks there? Thank you so much and congratulations.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Kash. I really appreciate your thoughtful comments and your question. I think the bottom line is consolidating the past is really not moving the ball forward and innovating the future is. I think we have a dream for the company. I think we know how to describe that dream to the C-suite. I think we're now toggling across the entire C-suite, where we've expanded the perimeter in the relationship plan and the solution road map. And obviously, internally, we've scaled the company where it's ready to make a bold move now and be the defining one in the enterprise. So I think all that's coming together once for us. In terms of the broader macro, you saw the investment in hardware, obviously, for the AI world. You saw the incredible success of the great NVIDIA company and the work that they're doing. You see great companies like Microsoft doing incredibly well with Office and dynamics and teams and copilot, so they're standard. And then you see the hyperscalers all doing well, whether it's Azure, it's AWS or its GCP, they're all doing well. And good news is we integrate with all of them. So we know the hyperscaler trend, okay? We built our Gen AI strategy with NVIDIA. We knew they were going to be the winner. We had no doubt about that. And we knew that the world of the 20th century would eventually get the picture that you can't upgrade the past and expect it to give you a different result. And any time we get a chance to tell that story and prove it with a great demo and great success cases, we blow people away with innovation. But to answer your question in terms of where are we headed? Where we're headed is we're going to transform entire industries. And if I give you an example of that, take the utility industry, for example, they have to maximize the power grid uptime. They're trying to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities of critical assets, and I need to do everything in real time, whether it's repairing things, taking care of equipment, skills, parts, field service technicians, equipment suppliers. There's a whole distributed value chain. We're going to reinvent the whole industry, and we've got to put it on the ServiceNow platform. And we've got to take the data, and we're going to connect all the disparate parts that are suffocating companies, and we're going to move it into the Now Platform, and we're going to reimagine the way work flows. And I could say that for manufacturing, think about predictive maintenance across multiple sites, combining IoT data with advanced analytics to optimize profitability, improve operational efficiency, think about consumer goods. They want AI-powered chatbots to deliver personalized shopping experiences. And just think about your own shopping experience. You could buy a great product, but if you can't return it in a streamlined way. You drop the brand. You're not doing business with them anymore. So it's a virtuous cycle to think about the quality of the product, the service experience of the customer and ultimately advocating for the customer and giving them what they want, that's all workflow, and we're going to automate that entire industry. And so rethink health care, rethink manufacturing, rethink utilities, you rethink consumer goods. We're going for it all.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Weed of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nPeter Weed: Thank you and congratulations on the continued momentum. I think the big surprising news of the day was, obviously, some of the changes in leadership. CJ obviously is a really important part of the senior leadership team one of the people that I often pointed out to clients about the success and leadership there. Beyond naming Chris as the Chief Product Officer, what do you see the key operational steps to ensure a smooth transition? And what additional actions are you taking to kind of ensure continuity and one of those keys to success. And I guess it's probably not just operationally with the team, but also probably with the public sector business, given that was a bit of where this work came from.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Peter. I appreciate your question. We have an unbelievable team. And actually, we've already been in execution mode on where we're taking the company and the leadership team. I met with all of them today, including Pat Casey, who is one of the co-founders of the company, and he actually runs the cloud for the company. and all of the line of business development leaders. Chris Bedi is in there on an acting capacity because he knows my decision making style and he can integrate beautifully with the great engineers that we have and the great grow to market people we have, so we don\u2019t drop a single step in our March to be the defining one. So everybody is fired up. They understand the mission, and they\u2019re ready to go. And I will hire a Chief Product Officer. It could come from the inside of the company or the outside of the company on a more permanent basis. But we\u2019re not going to miss a step in execution. We\u2019re already on the move. So very, very, very confident in our company. And by the way, they\u2019re very, very confident that our business is in great shape. And I do want to mention the U.S. public sector remains a substantially important industry vertical to our company, and we continue to believe that, that is poised for further growth, especially in third quarter because that\u2019s when a lot of the decisions get made. And we have our arms around that. Our great public service companies love us. We love them. We\u2019re doing a great job for them, and we don\u2019t intend to miss a beat here, Peter.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much. Operator, do we lose you there?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just an exceptional quarter, guys. Thanks for making our evening easier. So maybe, Bill, first question for you. Just as I think through AI, clearly, you're one of the few companies that's seeing significant demand upfront and strong early traction. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, for the companies that you're talking to about AI that have attached it, what do you think is causing them to hold out? And what do you think is the trigger that makes them join the party?\nWilliam McDermott: Yeah. In terms of the companies that are buying AI products in the companies that aren't?\nSamad Samana: Correct. For the ones that haven't adopted it yet, that you're still having that conversation with how do you get them to join the party?\nWilliam McDermott: Yeah. It's a really important question, Samad, because I think what's happened is they've heard so many whitewashed AI stories from pretenders that they are a little jaded. So we have to get in there and show them all the use cases, show them the demos, show them the customer success stories, give them the handful of references that are already doing it. And before you know it, were off to the races. And then we show them our road map for where we're taking the company and they realize they don't want second-mover advantage, because if other participants in their industry move out and they don't, they could lose. And also, if you think about employees, soon, employees won't tolerate the nonsenses going on with 800 numbers, busy work, silly work that doesn't make a difference and they'll go work somewhere else. So the same thing is true with customers. So I think that it's an education. It's a demonstration. And it's having the validity of success where you have permission to go into the C-suite and they're interested in listening to your story. Once they hear our story and once they see us in action, it's an order. And then it's a quick install and then it's a go-live and then it's amazing productivity. That's what's happening.\nGina Mastantuono: And Samad, I would just add, and I talked about this in my script that we're just scratching the surface of that opportunity and the vast majority of our current sales are direct, right? So we're working now really strongly with our partners and the ecosystem to arm them with the tools to sell, and that's going to extend our go-to-market reach even broader. Those partners are so critical and so important and they are leaning in very heavily with us. And so that's going to be another part of kind of the continued acceleration here.\nWilliam McDermott: I think Gina makes a great point there, and I did hear one analyst one say, yes, I've been talking to the partner checks and the channel and I'm not hearing a lot from the partners. Yes, that's because, as Gina said, they're still getting activated. But can you imagine when they do, if you see these results when we're doing it on our own and then you get thousands and thousands and thousands of more feet on the street telling the same story, it's a wow factor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Well, thanks. Maybe I'll direct this one to Gina. Gina, three months ago, you had signaled an expected pretty solid sequential acceleration in CRPO in 3Q. I know things change. So I'm just wondering if you might revisit that second half outlook. And specifically, given the second half election uncertainty that Bill flagged I'm wondering if you're being a shade more conservative on the 3Q CRPO guide, given how big 3Q is in the public sector.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes, Karl. It\u2019s a great question. I think that as expected, and I talked a little bit earlier that part of the beat, most of the beat for Q2 was all about execution and net new ACV, but there was part of the beat that was early renewals. I\u2019m continuing to be prudent in how I\u2019m factoring in early renewals because they are so customer-by-customer specific. And so what I would say is that I continue to be prudent in how we think about guide for Q3 and the full year. But I remain extremely confident in that pipeline that I talked about. So pipeline coverage ratios are strong maturity is better than same time last year. We came out of knowledge with 50% more pipe generated in the first 60 days. And that number, I spoke earlier, has surpassed $1 billion. And so pipe remains strong. Opportunity, as you\u2019ve heard Bill and I talk about so far today is fantastic. Demand seems healthy, but you\u2019re right, there\u2019s definitely a little bit of uncertainty in the back half of the year, and we continue to be prudent in some of our assumptions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around that on that same note there on pipeline. With 50% increase since knowledge, sounds impressive, sounds exciting. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength, maybe a glimpse into what that pipeline looks like across the stack. Are there any standouts whether it's in IT or customer employee creator? Obviously, NowAssist I'm sure, has a large part to do with that as well. So I just would love to get a little color there. Thank you.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah, Brad. I would say, it\u2019s very much across the board. Similar to the results that you saw in Q3, it\u2019s really strength across the platform. Whether it\u2019s IT, customer employee creator as well as NowAssist. And so what I would say is, we\u2019re operating on all cylinders here and pipeline being generated is really very across the board. But as you would imagine, with respect to Gen AI, there is such excitement and such attention there that we absolutely see very strong pipeline as we think about Gen AI in the back half and then moving into \u201825 and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much And I'll echo the congrats on a really nice quarter. Bill, you alluded to this a little bit earlier in one of your answers, but I was just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the opportunity around operational technology for you all. Where are you in terms of starting to have those conversations with customers? And can you just expand a little bit on your thoughts and hopes for that product set as we look out over the next six, 12 months? Thanks.\nWilliam McDermott: Yeah. Thank you very much, Kirk, for the question. I really do appreciate it. It\u2019s really amazing. The initial demand for this product and this offering, as you saw from the Washington, D.C. release and what you saw at knowledge \u201824 has really surprised us on the upside how quickly it\u2019s taken off. In Q2, as an example, we had a large biopharmaceutical company, Golfer OT. They mix it with IT. We had a huge biotech and pharma company and a large Japanese auto company. And what we\u2019re already seeing is partners like Boomi, STMicro and a multinational electronics company also based in Japan go for it. So we think that there\u2019s a big opportunity here for both of these products. OT has increased our technology workflow TAM by about $5 billion. In addition, we see sales and order management. This is helping us address the $68 billion customer workflow TAM. So it\u2019s still early days, but we are super encouraged by the traction that we see so far and we\u2019ll continue to monitor and update you guys on this, but it\u2019s a meaningful part of our portfolio now. And again, one of the beauties of this company is the beauty of linking the engineering development effort with the feet on the street and having that high-touch intimacy with the customer and the virtuous cycle back into development where the customer feels that they are the developers developing their dreams and our great engineers are capable of doing things so quickly here. And this is yet another example.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just the first one. This was like I think by far the strongest RPO quarter that you had in, I think, three years since 2021, and I guess the question is if I look at -- if I think about the inverse of Keith's questions around deals that pushed from Q1 to Q2, are there any deals that you feel like got done earlier than you otherwise would have thought that you may be pulled in any deals because the confidence, Gina, that you're referring to in the pipeline, help us just give us a sense for that? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah. So you're absolutely right. RPO growing at 31% year-over-year is pretty incredible, especially at our scale. We continue to see average contract terms increase right? And so Q2 had the largest quarterly average contract term for Q2 since 2018. And so we're seeing TCV from five plus year deals more than tripling. I said that in my script. And so we're really seeing a meaningful uptick in multiyear duration contracts as customers are really seeing the power of the Now platform and just making longer, more strategic deals, which is resulting in that. And so no big differences in kind of any pull forwards of deals, a slight uptick in early renewals, as I talked about, but that was only against a prudent guide. So again, it's really about the power of the platform customers really understanding how we're using Gen AI into that platform and really becoming the AI platform for business transformation. That's it.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And maybe just linearity in the quarter, any commentary there? And maybe also if AI conversations are already driving just much larger, more strategic engagements that are leading to some of this RPO growth.\nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So linearity in Q2 was good. I feel really good about what we saw. And absolutely, AI is AI conversations are driving very strategic engagements and obviously, driving larger average contract terms, right? Again, it's customers really leaning into a longer strategic partnership and getting it now. And so I think all of that is a big part of what you're seeing in our results.\nWilliam McDermott: And Alex, I would build on what Gina stand by just thinking about the time line that you mentioned, we became a platform company, that's what happened. We've gone from a product company with a land and expand mentality to an AI platform for business transformation that's looking at industry that we're looking at the complete bandwidth of what a company is trying to pull off. And then to give you a piece of the brand, I think we differentiated ourselves by putting AI to work for people. And people include people like us. It includes employees. It includes customers. It includes people that build the software and includes people to keep the place secure. So all these things were taken into account in the strategic direction of how we would build a strategic platform company. And when Gina tells you, the deal sizes are expanding. The duration of the agreements are expanding. It\u2019s consistent with the company that is scaling, right, before your eyes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much, amazing quarter. Bill, I'm wondering what did you experience? And what type of opportunity do you see perhaps in response to the crowd strike issues and outages. Is it reasonable to think that you could have some large companies that would want more telemetry across the IP estate more ability to monitor and detect outages and improve incident response. It would seem like that could play a directly into your ITOM and SecOps capabilities. And then, Gina, I saw the sales and marketing headcount growth picked up. And I was wondering if you just reached a point where something is signaling to you to move into a more aggressive kind of a hiring posture?\nWilliam McDermott: Okay. Well, I'll start off and then Gina can talk about our hiring strategy, and thank you for your kind remarks, Mark. There was 0 impact on customer systems from CrowdStrike outage on July '18 as it relates to ServiceNow. There was zero impact to data integrity financial systems and the integrity of the operations of the companies as it relates to ServiceNow. And thanks to our CMDB, I think you're onto a very good marketing and sales idea and the service mapping of the CMDB we had instant visibility into which systems, which business services and infrastructure were impacted in our customers' environment. And our automated workflows sped up the remediation and the employees were kept up to date via our ServiceNow portal. So I think this could actually lead to more sales opportunities once non-ServiceNow customers see what's possible with a platform like this.\nGina Mastantuono: And on your question on sales and marketing, I highlighted that it would be picking up even in Q1, right? So Q1 was a little bit lower because last year, Q1 was a big hiring quarter. But yes, we absolutely are focused on ensuring that we're hiring feet on the street, quota bearing sales to go and drive these opportunities that we keep talking about. So we do expect hiring and sales and marketing to kind of continue to tick up a bit that very much in line with our original plans. And obviously, the more we over exceed and the opportunity grows, we will continue to hire to ensure that we have those feet on the street driving and closing those deals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the fantastic quarter. Bill, for you, you acknowledge you announced a further strategic partnership with Microsoft now assisting copilot integration. Just love to hear from you how that's actually proceeding and if you're driving deals together for those solutions. Thanks.\nA \u2013 William McDermott: Thank you very much, Joel. We have a really fantastic partnership with Microsoft. And I think that has actually opened additional addressable market for ServiceNow. And there is a co-sell motion with Microsoft\u2019s enterprise sales team. We do work together very closely with them. And we\u2019re a good teammates, and we\u2019re good partners. And we know that both of us working together is what the customer wants. That\u2019s why we do it. And ServiceNow is really helping customers streamline their migrations to Azure. And while Azure exposes us to a much wider spectrum of customers, I think we also help the relevance of Azure because we\u2019re getting big. And we\u2019re expanding in multiple industries and geographies. And we\u2019re really thinking strategically about how we can win net new logos together, and we\u2019ve had some examples of them. We closed seven $1 million-plus now on Azure deals in Q2, with two of them as new logo wins, and one deal, in fact, was over $30 million in net new ACV. So we\u2019re quite confident that the partnership and synergy will enable us to bring value to more customers and we\u2019ll do it at unprecedented speed and scale. And I have been very straight up with everybody. I don\u2019t go any place without acknowledging Microsoft as a standard. And I recognize the copilot does very important things, and it gets even more interesting when all the capability of NowAssist and the things that we built our platform to do is complementary and fully integrated into Microsoft. And that\u2019s really the winning formula, and it has been from day one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRobbie Owens: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Bill, somewhat curious just where customer conversations are around data governance as we think about these modern architectures as you're thinking about RaptorDB, is that an area that we should expect ServiceNow to play in directly or play in via partnership? Thanks.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Rob. I would say at this point, I want you to think about workflow automation, Gen AI on our platform and our ability to take RaptorDB and gather any data source, regardless of who\u2019s governing it or where it is and activating that in to automate the way things get done. And as an example, this lighthouse program that we have has a group right now of design partners and early adapters of RaptorDB. And I think it will further accelerate our pro version of the ServiceNow platform in addition to entering us into a whole new TAM to complement the Now platform, Pro+, NowAssist and then the RaptorDB-Pro. And we\u2019re going to use the learnings from this program to further develop our offering. And we do see our role as integrating as opposed to competing with other data providers because the customer wants to activate our platform to do good work with all of the data estates that they have because we have the only AI platform for business transformation in the enterprise. And if we can go everywhere, it just extends our reach and the bandwidth of our TAM and the executional excellence that we can bring to stakeholders. So it\u2019s all part of our thinking big and activating all this in industry-specific use cases. So when we show up, we\u2019re not funding through a brochure, we got a demo in our hands, and we\u2019re showing you how you can transform a business process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much and congrats on the elite level execution and the great results. Gina, I just got a couple of quick ones for you. You had a big step-up in CapEx this quarter. Can you comment on what drove that and the cadence we should expect going forward? And then also just a point of clarification. Is there any federal business you foresee having to unwind as a result of the investigation you conducted? And should we assume that, that would all be factored into guidance? Thanks.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah. So I\u2019ll take that second question first. So no, there\u2019s no federal business that we foresee we will need to unwind full stop. And then with respect to the step-up in CapEx, it\u2019s more quarterly timing than anything else. Expectations for full year has not changed. And as you would imagine, focus of our CapEx is on AI and Gen AI. But as we talked about at Financial Analyst Day, it\u2019s already baked into any guidance that I would have given you. So I wouldn\u2019t take into account an any quarterly kind of timing-related stuff.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome. Very helpful and congrats again.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Brad.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nMichael Cikos: Great. Thanks for getting me on, guys. I just had a couple of quick questions. The first I think that you guys had expected, call it, about 200 basis points of headwind to 2Q CRPO in relation to the public sector. Did that play out as expected? And then can you remind us \u2013 off the top of my head, I want to say that normalizes as we lap those contracts in Q3. But does that federal headwind go away now.\nGina Mastantuono: So yes, that headwind to Q2 CRPO did play out as expected. And yes, it will normalize in Q3. But remember, depending on the size of our Fed business in Q3, it could pop up again as we play out Q4 and beyond. Obviously, we\u2019ll let you know as that comes to fruition or not. But yes, it should normalize now in Q3 as expected.\nMichael Cikos: Understood. Thank you very much and congrats on a strong quarter.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks so much, Mike.\nOperator: We have time for one last question. Your last question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a quick one for Gina. Kind of following up on the last few questions. Subscription revenue has been decelerating here, but CRPO has been accelerating and obviously, even put the guide. Is that just a function, Gina, of the renewals that we\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s Q2 or Q3? Just maybe a little bit of the divergence between subscription revenue and CRPO growth.\nGina Mastantuono: Yeah. So basically, what that really is showing you is that net new ACV has reaccelerated in first half \u201824 versus first half \u201823. The other piece has nothing to do with early renewals really. The other piece is that are expected on-prem mix in Q3 of this year is lower than \u2013 is a little bit lower than last year. So all good things as you think about the results for Q2 and what it means going forward.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Congrats on the quarter guys.\nGina Mastantuono: Thanks, Matt.\nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Matt.\nOperator: We thank you for your participation in today's call. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. By now you've all seen the press release, we crushed the quarter, we raised the full year guidance, and we've never been more excited about the future of ServiceNow. But before we get into all the details, I just want to comment on the leadership announcements we made today. The company received an internal complaint earlier this year regarding the hiring of an individual who had previously been a U.S. government employee. As you would expect, we took the complaint very seriously. The Board of Directors conducted a thorough internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel and determined that our company policy was violated. Acting with total transparency, the company proactively disclose the findings of the investigation to the proper government entities. And as a result, today, we're announcing the departure of the individual who's hiring was the subject of the original complaint. We also came to a mutual agreement that CJ Desai, our President and COO, would offer his resignation from the company effective immediately. While we believe this was an isolated incident, we are further sharpening our hiring policies and procedures as a result of the situation. And when it comes to compliance, let me be perfectly clear, we are fully committed to doing the right thing. And from a continuity standpoint, I'm extremely proud that our team has the incredible depth of talent and expertise to lead forward without any disruption. In fact, Chris Bedi, a respective ServiceNow executive for the past decade, who was recently named the MIT Sloan CIO Leadership Award winner for 2024. He'll serve as the interim Chief Product Officer, while I consider internal and external candidates alike. Our entire products and engineering team is the best in the enterprise software industry, and they're focused on delivering our Xanadu release in a few weeks' time. In fact, I just got done talking with them. They're in great shape. And we wanted to give you the facts as clearly and succinctly as possible because we have so much else to cover today. So as I said at the start, ServiceNow is once again in a beat and raise situation. Our Q2 results prove that we are delivering elite level execution. Subscription revenue grew 23% year-over-year at constant currency, which is 100 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO grew 22.5% at constant currency, which is 200 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 27%, nearly 250 basis points above our guidance and we had 88 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV, up from 70% a year ago, a 26% year-over-year increase. A year ago, Q2 had one deal greater than 1 million from a net new logo perspective. This year, we had six of them that were net new logos. Our first federal customer actually crossed the 100 million plus ACV threshold, and we signed our third largest net new AC deal ever. All of our workflow businesses were in more than one-half of our top 20 deals. Security and Risk, ITSM and ITOM had eight, nine and 10 deals over 1 million, respectively. Customer workflows had a big Q2 with 14 deals over 1 million, employee workflows had 12 deals over 1 million and creator had 10 deals over 1 million. What's the headline? ServiceNow is relevance is the AI platform for business transformation is soaring. This is a growth company on an unprecedented trajectory. Moving to the topic of AI. NowAssist net new ACV doubled quarter-over-quarter, significantly overachieving our expectations and it became the fastest growing new product in the company's history. We signed 11 NowAssist deals with 1 million plus NACV in Q2, two of which were over $5 million. We had impressive wins across industries, from banking, health care and manufacturing to semis, tech and many others. As an AI lighthouse customer, Stellantis is using ServiceNow. As its strategic AI platform to manage operations across HR, finance and supply chain. American Honda selected NowAssist as their Gen AI solution of choice to improve deflection and efficiency of service, delivering a world class experience to their employees. Merck is using the ServiceNow platform to streamline operations across IT and cybersecurity to advance its global biopharmaceutical business. Adobe will leverage NowAssist to optimize routine tasks for employees, which will increase efficiency across the entire organization. Dell will integrate NowAssist with its service capabilities to deliver a seamless customer and employee experience and with NowAssist, ST Microelectronics plans to enhance productivity and user experiences across their entire organization. LTIMindtree is using NowAssist for ITSM to increase developer productivity by 30% with code and flow generation. We're also collaborating together to grow and expand offerings in finance and supply chain workflows. So why are so many enterprises rapidly adopting ServiceNow's Gen AI strategy? Think about this in the context of design thinking and innovation. The first pillar is always desirability. Do we have the big idea? ServiceNow is putting AI to work for people. Our Gen AI strategy is focused on infusing intelligence into the flow of work, end-to-end across the enterprise, every department, every persona. With our native integrations, we already help people orchestrate across different systems and data sources. Now we can train the machines to do the low value work so the people can up level to the knowledge work. The second pillar is viability, does our approach to Gen AI make business sense? We set the tone on innovating with domain specific multimodal language models. This approach is more accurate. It doesn't have the hallucinations of the large models from the Internet. It's faster to train, and it's faster to deploy these models. It's more cost effective and sustainable because these models are less GPU hungry than public models. The final pillar is feasibility. Can we actually do it? This is the best pillar of all for ServiceNow because we've actually done it. When you look at our own deployment of NowAssist, the initial results are staggering. With better deflection, our IT help desk is saving 45 minutes per avoided case and customer service. Our colleagues are saving 30 minutes every time the computer generates the knowledge based article for them. Our employees will save 21,000 hours with faster self-service and our developers are completing non-complex scripts and half the time. This is a moment where business leaders are looking for the role model. What does it look like to run a business with Gen AI at the core? ServiceNow. Thanks to our engineering and our Now on Now teams is leading the way. This is an excitement for Gen AI. And it's one recent Gartner forecast global IT spending will be up 8.9% in 2024 and that's even higher than originally forecasted. By the way, more than 3 times GDP. Within software spend according to IDC, Software-as-a-Service will grow 17%. So the trend line is clear. Enterprise software buyers are moving away from consolidating the past into building for the AI future. ServiceNow has been the modernizer at many points on this journey, creating a single pane of glass into the IT estate. Expanding our core from IT to employee service to customer service, now making it easy to build new consumer grade applications on a single data model. The AI moment is the culmination of this journey. CIOs don't want 1,000 points of dim light. They're betting on a few market leading platforms working together as the great unlock. They see ServiceNow as the intelligent action platform spanning the entire enterprise. And that is why our pipeline has built from knowledge over 50% year-over-year improvement. It's why CIO surveys continue to show ServiceNow's relevance rising to the top of the charts. It's why more IT and line of business buyers alike are looking at long-term blueprints for ServiceNow and planning out the future with us. It's why Jensen Wang hit it on the head when he said, ServiceNow is the AI operating system for the enterprise. Customers are seeing us like Jensen sees us. While our performance has been consistently strong, we take nothing for granted. Every aspect of our innovation engine and our go-to-market machine is moving up to the next level. We're tracking and tackling more of the automation and market opportunities every day with both our customers and our engineers. Our new Creator Studio available with ServiceNow App Engine is extending our existing low code leadership to no code. So every employee can now build applications. Other updates to our automation engine help simplify RPA deployments. We see a great opportunity for ServiceNow there. We're moving even faster on co-innovation partnerships with major global brands, an expanded multiyear agreement will extend ServiceNow capabilities to all BT Group units. Bell Canada will develop new capabilities within the business service experience while accelerating their own internal transformation as a tech services and digital media leader. This is the largest telecommunications collaboration for ServiceNow and the first of its kind in Canada. Boomi is expanding from a small ServiceNow footprint to replace existing competitor implementations. Boomi will use all NowAssist solutions and work with us on joint product development. Deloitte is leveraging the ServiceNow platform to drive industry specific managed services to bring AI based innovations to clients around the world. We are accelerating our growth in key geographic markets and verticals. ServiceNow will help the U.S. Air Force adopt new best-in-class technology. The federal government's National Science Foundation is utilizing ServiceNow's new Gen AI solutions to support their mission to promote research, expanding knowledge and science, engineering and education. In Germany, Bayer is using NowAssist to empower their employees with Gen AI and hyper automation as they create a culture, where every employee has the potential to innovate. Our momentum in Japan continues with major wins this quarter, including Nomura, Panasonic Information Systems and Nitori Holdings. We announced plans to launch a ServiceNow UAE cloud hosted on Microsoft Azure, so we can meet the business transformation requirements of all public and private sector entities in the UAE. We announced two growth investments in our partner ecosystem in India. In Morpheus, we'll extend our presence in India and across Southeast Asia through the development of new Gen AI offerings, solutions and digital skills training. Prodapt will further develop digital business transformation through AI enabled solutions and the Now Platform skills expansion. We're also expanding into new categories, further increasing ServiceNow's total addressable market yet again. Industry analysts have reported that the number one priority for CIOs is getting their data house in order. And that's why at knowledge, we shared our plans for a powerful new database offering. RaptorDB, it's built for enterprises looking for speed and scale to support new AI use cases. RaptorDB give ServiceNow customers the capability to ingest data at massive scale from multiple data sources, so they can analyze it much faster to feed our domain specific models. We're already achieving 12x transactional throughput and 27x improvement in response time for analytic inquiries in our ProPlus version of the platform. Today, we're launching the RaptorDB lighthouse program. This is similar to our highly successful Gen AI lighthouse program. This new offering is designed for a select group of top customers at the forefront of this new AI world. We already have many signing up. We also completed a tuck-in acquisition of Raizen, an industry leading data company based in Germany, in combination with NowAssist. Raizen will further accelerate our Gen AI-powered search and knowledge management capabilities. This is only the beginning. The data opportunity is massive, and we intend to make some additional announcements on September 10, regarding our growing data ambition. As you can see, ServiceNow is not opportunity constrained. New buying centers, new industries, new geographic markets and we're fielding more inbound interest for new partnerships that at any point in our history. There's a sense of excitement here in the community, in our company, and it's all for good reason. In closing, our focus is exactly where it should be. Expanding this differentiated platform, scaling this business, and delivering great results for our stakeholders. I've got a few questions about the second half, with a rare speculation out there that elections or other macro factors will challenge the business environment. Are our customers mindful of the unknowns and the broader macro, of course, that's exactly why they are leaning in to ServiceNow. Because AI is the elixir that drives productivity, cost efficiency and new business models. Simply put, Enterprises are investing in business transformation. They are investing in AI. They are building a new reference architecture for the decades to come. This is the largest, most compelling business opportunity in the world. We are bullish on what's ahead. That's why we have not only confirmed, but also raised our full year guidance. Our brand represents an optimistic view of the world's future. It's why we're putting AI to work for people. And ultimately, why? As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Fred Luddy's original dream, we believe the next 20 years will be even more exciting. I personally have never been more convinced that ServiceNow will be the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your questions. I'll now turn you over to Gina. Gina, over to you. Thank you very much for the question, Keith. I would, first of all, begin by discussing this incredible platform and the difference that it makes. If you take all the complexity that's out there, and you think about what CEOs today want, they're looking for new vectors of growth to have to radically simplify their companies and digitization is really the only way out. But the difficult thing is most people are selling into a department where they have a narrow threaded solution and that doesn't necessarily change the way work flows and the way business processes get executed. So we're able, -- especially with our Gen AI built into this incredible platform, we're able to demonstrate real value, and that ROI is undeniable and we have a culture built to deliver value. We have a team in who knows how to describe value. And obviously, we're very market connected. I do give the culture here credit for what I call an elite level of execution. So that's just built into the fabric of our DNA, great innovation, great execution, great integration between what we build, how we take it to market, and how in the post-sale world, we care for that value to be ultimately delivered quickly and provable ROI. Yeah. Raimo, thank you very much for the question. And I think the key to our domain specific or smaller models, as you mentioned it, they're lightning quick. There's no latency because we're working with the customers' data. They are highly secure again because it's the customer's data, and they're inexpensive to run. And when companies see the bandwidth of a platform that goes end-to-end. So everywhere from the entire IT estate for digital transformation, or recreating an employee experience where employees actually get excited to come to work and do their job, because we take the busy work out of their life or the customer experience can be totally reimagined and then inspiring developers to do what they do best, which is dream about net new innovation and building new business models. You see this, obviously, you mentioned BT, I could have easily said London Stock Exchange, where they deployed us for a core business transformation, and they unified 15 siloed platforms and 14 lines of business on the ServiceNow platform. And they actually saw a deflection rates increase to 85% of the cases, and 35% time improved and summarizing incidents. And by the way, NowAssist does this in seconds. So we're talking about two days per employee improvement and productivity. I could have gone to TriMedx. A biotech company and basically, what they're doing NowAssist is they're enhancing developer productivity, which has increased for them 22%, and they saw 50% of their developers actively using NowAssist in just three months. I could have also mentioned Kainos, a digital technology solutions provider. They created 600 knowledge articles with NowAssist and they were able to improve access to their knowledge content for their customers and employees. Their satisfaction from a customer standpoint went from 80 to 99 and this is just amazing stuff. We just went general availability with our Gen AI SKUs for our government Community Cloud. This is June 28, by the way. One customer had a go live in implementation schedule for Q3, but their pilot went so well that they decided, they needed it immediately activated in Q2. So you're into a whole different program here with rapid time to value a product that people love to use and the executives get excited because their people are so happy. Their customers are so happy. Their innovators are so happy. And we're so market connected that we know what's going on in every one of these instances, they know we're not mailing it in from a deck. Thank you. Thank you very much, Kash. I really appreciate your thoughtful comments and your question. I think the bottom line is consolidating the past is really not moving the ball forward and innovating the future is. I think we have a dream for the company. I think we know how to describe that dream to the C-suite. I think we're now toggling across the entire C-suite, where we've expanded the perimeter in the relationship plan and the solution road map. And obviously, internally, we've scaled the company where it's ready to make a bold move now and be the defining one in the enterprise. So I think all that's coming together once for us. In terms of the broader macro, you saw the investment in hardware, obviously, for the AI world. You saw the incredible success of the great NVIDIA company and the work that they're doing. You see great companies like Microsoft doing incredibly well with Office and dynamics and teams and copilot, so they're standard. And then you see the hyperscalers all doing well, whether it's Azure, it's AWS or its GCP, they're all doing well. And good news is we integrate with all of them. So we know the hyperscaler trend, okay? We built our Gen AI strategy with NVIDIA. We knew they were going to be the winner. We had no doubt about that. And we knew that the world of the 20th century would eventually get the picture that you can't upgrade the past and expect it to give you a different result. And any time we get a chance to tell that story and prove it with a great demo and great success cases, we blow people away with innovation. But to answer your question in terms of where are we headed? Where we're headed is we're going to transform entire industries. And if I give you an example of that, take the utility industry, for example, they have to maximize the power grid uptime. They're trying to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities of critical assets, and I need to do everything in real time, whether it's repairing things, taking care of equipment, skills, parts, field service technicians, equipment suppliers. There's a whole distributed value chain. We're going to reinvent the whole industry, and we've got to put it on the ServiceNow platform. And we've got to take the data, and we're going to connect all the disparate parts that are suffocating companies, and we're going to move it into the Now Platform, and we're going to reimagine the way work flows. And I could say that for manufacturing, think about predictive maintenance across multiple sites, combining IoT data with advanced analytics to optimize profitability, improve operational efficiency, think about consumer goods. They want AI-powered chatbots to deliver personalized shopping experiences. And just think about your own shopping experience. You could buy a great product, but if you can't return it in a streamlined way. You drop the brand. You're not doing business with them anymore. So it's a virtuous cycle to think about the quality of the product, the service experience of the customer and ultimately advocating for the customer and giving them what they want, that's all workflow, and we're going to automate that entire industry. And so rethink health care, rethink manufacturing, rethink utilities, you rethink consumer goods. We're going for it all. Thank you very much, Peter. I appreciate your question. We have an unbelievable team. And actually, we've already been in execution mode on where we're taking the company and the leadership team. I met with all of them today, including Pat Casey, who is one of the co-founders of the company, and he actually runs the cloud for the company. and all of the line of business development leaders. Chris Bedi is in there on an acting capacity because he knows my decision making style and he can integrate beautifully with the great engineers that we have and the great grow to market people we have, so we don't drop a single step in our March to be the defining one. So everybody is fired up. They understand the mission, and they're ready to go. And I will hire a Chief Product Officer. It could come from the inside of the company or the outside of the company on a more permanent basis. But we're not going to miss a step in execution. We're already on the move. So very, very, very confident in our company. And by the way, they're very, very confident that our business is in great shape. And I do want to mention the U.S. public sector remains a substantially important industry vertical to our company, and we continue to believe that, that is poised for further growth, especially in third quarter because that's when a lot of the decisions get made. And we have our arms around that. Our great public service companies love us. We love them. We're doing a great job for them, and we don't intend to miss a beat here, Peter. Thank you very much. Operator, do we lose you there? Yeah. In terms of the companies that are buying AI products in the companies that aren't? Yeah. It's a really important question, Samad, because I think what's happened is they've heard so many whitewashed AI stories from pretenders that they are a little jaded. So we have to get in there and show them all the use cases, show them the demos, show them the customer success stories, give them the handful of references that are already doing it. And before you know it, were off to the races. And then we show them our road map for where we're taking the company and they realize they don't want second-mover advantage, because if other participants in their industry move out and they don't, they could lose. And also, if you think about employees, soon, employees won't tolerate the nonsenses going on with 800 numbers, busy work, silly work that doesn't make a difference and they'll go work somewhere else. So the same thing is true with customers. So I think that it's an education. It's a demonstration. And it's having the validity of success where you have permission to go into the C-suite and they're interested in listening to your story. Once they hear our story and once they see us in action, it's an order. And then it's a quick install and then it's a go-live and then it's amazing productivity. That's what's happening. I think Gina makes a great point there, and I did hear one analyst one say, yes, I've been talking to the partner checks and the channel and I'm not hearing a lot from the partners. Yes, that's because, as Gina said, they're still getting activated. But can you imagine when they do, if you see these results when we're doing it on our own and then you get thousands and thousands and thousands of more feet on the street telling the same story, it's a wow factor. Yeah. Thank you very much, Kirk, for the question. I really do appreciate it. It's really amazing. The initial demand for this product and this offering, as you saw from the Washington, D.C. release and what you saw at knowledge \u201824 has really surprised us on the upside how quickly it's taken off. In Q2, as an example, we had a large biopharmaceutical company, Golfer OT. They mix it with IT. We had a huge biotech and pharma company and a large Japanese auto company. And what we're already seeing is partners like Boomi, STMicro and a multinational electronics company also based in Japan go for it. So we think that there's a big opportunity here for both of these products. OT has increased our technology workflow TAM by about $5 billion. In addition, we see sales and order management. This is helping us address the $68 billion customer workflow TAM. So it's still early days, but we are super encouraged by the traction that we see so far and we'll continue to monitor and update you guys on this, but it's a meaningful part of our portfolio now. And again, one of the beauties of this company is the beauty of linking the engineering development effort with the feet on the street and having that high-touch intimacy with the customer and the virtuous cycle back into development where the customer feels that they are the developers developing their dreams and our great engineers are capable of doing things so quickly here. And this is yet another example. And Alex, I would build on what Gina stand by just thinking about the time line that you mentioned, we became a platform company, that's what happened. We've gone from a product company with a land and expand mentality to an AI platform for business transformation that's looking at industry that we're looking at the complete bandwidth of what a company is trying to pull off. And then to give you a piece of the brand, I think we differentiated ourselves by putting AI to work for people. And people include people like us. It includes employees. It includes customers. It includes people that build the software and includes people to keep the place secure. So all these things were taken into account in the strategic direction of how we would build a strategic platform company. And when Gina tells you, the deal sizes are expanding. The duration of the agreements are expanding. It's consistent with the company that is scaling, right, before your eyes. Okay. Well, I'll start off and then Gina can talk about our hiring strategy, and thank you for your kind remarks, Mark. There was 0 impact on customer systems from CrowdStrike outage on July '18 as it relates to ServiceNow. There was zero impact to data integrity financial systems and the integrity of the operations of the companies as it relates to ServiceNow. And thanks to our CMDB, I think you're onto a very good marketing and sales idea and the service mapping of the CMDB we had instant visibility into which systems, which business services and infrastructure were impacted in our customers' environment. And our automated workflows sped up the remediation and the employees were kept up to date via our ServiceNow portal. So I think this could actually lead to more sales opportunities once non-ServiceNow customers see what's possible with a platform like this. Thank you very much for the question, Rob. I would say at this point, I want you to think about workflow automation, Gen AI on our platform and our ability to take RaptorDB and gather any data source, regardless of who's governing it or where it is and activating that in to automate the way things get done. And as an example, this lighthouse program that we have has a group right now of design partners and early adapters of RaptorDB. And I think it will further accelerate our pro version of the ServiceNow platform in addition to entering us into a whole new TAM to complement the Now platform, Pro+, NowAssist and then the RaptorDB-Pro. And we're going to use the learnings from this program to further develop our offering. And we do see our role as integrating as opposed to competing with other data providers because the customer wants to activate our platform to do good work with all of the data estates that they have because we have the only AI platform for business transformation in the enterprise. And if we can go everywhere, it just extends our reach and the bandwidth of our TAM and the executional excellence that we can bring to stakeholders. So it's all part of our thinking big and activating all this in industry-specific use cases. So when we show up, we're not funding through a brochure, we got a demo in our hands, and we're showing you how you can transform a business process. Thank you, Brad. Thank you very much, Matt."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q2 was another fantastic quarter with tremendous beats across all of our top line and profitability metrics. ServiceNow's business remains resilient with net new ACV and Gen AI contributions exceeding expectations. Once again, the team demonstrated exceptional execution as we continue to see strong demand for the Now Platform and our NowAssist offerings. Q2 subscription revenues were $2.542 billion, growing 23% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $18.6 billion, representing 31.5% year-over-year constant currency growth. We continue to see average contract terms increase with TCV from five plus year deals more than tripling year-over-year. Current RPO was $8.78 billion, representing 22.5% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 200 basis point beat versus our guidance, and a 150 basis point acceleration from Q1. From an industry perspective, U.S. Federal had a great quarter, accelerating both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year with net new ACV up well over 50% from last Q2. Manufacturing and Energy and utilities were also areas of strength, growing net new ACV over 50% year-over-year. Healthcare & Life Sciences and Retail and Hospitality, both had a great quarter, growing about 30% year-over-year. The Now Platform remains a mission critical part of our customers' operations, reflected by a strong 98% renewal rate. The stickiness of our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to continue to build upon. We closed 88 deals greater than 1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, representing 26% growth year-over-year. This includes six new logos, two of which were G2K customers. We continue to see robust large deal momentum in the quarter closing 14 deals over 5 million in net new ACV and four deals over 10 million. Our focus on selling a comprehensive platform continue to drive more multiproduct deals, as 14 of our top 20 deals included eight or more products. We now have 1,988 customers paying us over 1 million in ACV. In addition, the number of customers paying us 20 million or more grew nearly 40% year-over-year. As Bill highlighted, our Gen AI net new ACV to date continues to trend ahead of any new product family launched for the comparable period. Our Plus SKU saw more than a 30% price uplift over Pro in Q2. Furthermore since launch, we're seeing a greater than 3x increase in average deal size versus the comparable Pro upgrade. NowAssist cogeneration capabilities within creative workflows remain a powerful productivity tool of choice as well, appearing in over 70% of our Gen AI deals. Best of all, customers are going live fast. We're learning with them, releasing innovations based on that feedback at a very fast clip to get them to value. In July, BT Group announced that its NowAssist pilot help agents write case summaries and review complex nodes faster, cutting both times by 55%. This helped drive down the average time to resolve cases by a third. We are just scratching the surface of the opportunity as the vast majority of Gen AI sales are direct. We're working to onboard partners, arming them with the tools to sell NowAssist and further extend our go-to-market reach. Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 27%, approximately 250 basis points above our guidance, driven by OpEx efficiencies, top line outperformance and timing of marketing spend. Our free cash flow margin was 14%. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $8.9 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world class growth, profitability and shareholder value. Moving to our guidance. Given our Q2 outperformance, we are raising our 2024 outlook. For 2024, we are raising our subscription revenues by $33 million at the midpoint of the range to more than offset an incremental $20 million FX headwinds. This raise yields a net increase of $13 million on a narrowed range of $10.575 billion to $10.585 billion representing 22% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We're also raising our full year operating margin target from 29% to 29.5%. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, free cash flow margin of 31%, and GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of $208 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $2.660 billion and $2.665 billion, representing 20% to 20.5% year-over-year growth or 20.5% on a constant currency basis. We expect CRPO growth of 22.5% on a reported basis or 22% on a constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 29.5%. Finally, we expect $209 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter, and we continue to see strength heading into the second half of the year. Our knowledge embed in May was an incredible three days of inspiring keynotes, amazing demos, intriguing breakout sessions and plenty of discussions around AI as it was woven into every aspect of the event. ServiceNow's focus on putting AI to work for people was a consistent theme for the over 20,000 participants, including 5 billion of pipeline in the room. The response from customers around our latest innovation has been incredible. As Bill mentioned, newly created pipeline after only 60 days was up 50% year-over-year and that has since growth over $1 billion. Our second half pipelines combined with our net new ACV outperformance in the first half of '24 gives us very good visibility into our top line guide and further confidence in our journey to $15 billion plus in revenue. We are well on our way to becoming a defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter, and Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this incredible team. With that, I'll open it up to Q&A. And then, Keith, on your question about any unusual activity of deals slipping from Q1 to Q2? No. Actually, we just saw pretty incredible great execution across the board in Q2. From a revenue perspective, net new ACV outperformance that we talked about strong execution of the ServiceNow incredible go-to-market team, as you would expect. On-prem did come in a little bit ahead of expectations, but the net new ACV outperformance was more -- was much more impactful. With respect to the CRPO beat, also, again, primarily driven by net new ACV outperformance, a little bit higher or early renewals. As you know, I've been pretty prudent in how I've been guiding for early renewals and continue to do so. But the beat was really a function of incredible execution by this team once again. Thanks, Raimo. And Samad, I would just add, and I talked about this in my script that we're just scratching the surface of that opportunity and the vast majority of our current sales are direct, right? So we're working now really strongly with our partners and the ecosystem to arm them with the tools to sell, and that's going to extend our go-to-market reach even broader. Those partners are so critical and so important and they are leaning in very heavily with us. And so that's going to be another part of kind of the continued acceleration here. Yes, Karl. It's a great question. I think that as expected, and I talked a little bit earlier that part of the beat, most of the beat for Q2 was all about execution and net new ACV, but there was part of the beat that was early renewals. I'm continuing to be prudent in how I'm factoring in early renewals because they are so customer-by-customer specific. And so what I would say is that I continue to be prudent in how we think about guide for Q3 and the full year. But I remain extremely confident in that pipeline that I talked about. So pipeline coverage ratios are strong maturity is better than same time last year. We came out of knowledge with 50% more pipe generated in the first 60 days. And that number, I spoke earlier, has surpassed $1 billion. And so pipe remains strong. Opportunity, as you've heard Bill and I talk about so far today is fantastic. Demand seems healthy, but you're right, there's definitely a little bit of uncertainty in the back half of the year, and we continue to be prudent in some of our assumptions. Yeah, Brad. I would say, it's very much across the board. Similar to the results that you saw in Q3, it's really strength across the platform. Whether it's IT, customer employee creator as well as NowAssist. And so what I would say is, we're operating on all cylinders here and pipeline being generated is really very across the board. But as you would imagine, with respect to Gen AI, there is such excitement and such attention there that we absolutely see very strong pipeline as we think about Gen AI in the back half and then moving into \u201825 and beyond. Yeah. So you're absolutely right. RPO growing at 31% year-over-year is pretty incredible, especially at our scale. We continue to see average contract terms increase right? And so Q2 had the largest quarterly average contract term for Q2 since 2018. And so we're seeing TCV from five plus year deals more than tripling. I said that in my script. And so we're really seeing a meaningful uptick in multiyear duration contracts as customers are really seeing the power of the Now platform and just making longer, more strategic deals, which is resulting in that. And so no big differences in kind of any pull forwards of deals, a slight uptick in early renewals, as I talked about, but that was only against a prudent guide. So again, it's really about the power of the platform customers really understanding how we're using Gen AI into that platform and really becoming the AI platform for business transformation. That's it. Yes. So linearity in Q2 was good. I feel really good about what we saw. And absolutely, AI is AI conversations are driving very strategic engagements and obviously, driving larger average contract terms, right? Again, it's customers really leaning into a longer strategic partnership and getting it now. And so I think all of that is a big part of what you're seeing in our results. And on your question on sales and marketing, I highlighted that it would be picking up even in Q1, right? So Q1 was a little bit lower because last year, Q1 was a big hiring quarter. But yes, we absolutely are focused on ensuring that we're hiring feet on the street, quota bearing sales to go and drive these opportunities that we keep talking about. So we do expect hiring and sales and marketing to kind of continue to tick up a bit that very much in line with our original plans. And obviously, the more we over exceed and the opportunity grows, we will continue to hire to ensure that we have those feet on the street driving and closing those deals. Yeah. So I'll take that second question first. So no, there's no federal business that we foresee we will need to unwind full stop. And then with respect to the step-up in CapEx, it's more quarterly timing than anything else. Expectations for full year has not changed. And as you would imagine, focus of our CapEx is on AI and Gen AI. But as we talked about at Financial Analyst Day, it's already baked into any guidance that I would have given you. So I wouldn't take into account an any quarterly kind of timing-related stuff. Thanks, Brad. So yes, that headwind to Q2 CRPO did play out as expected. And yes, it will normalize in Q3. But remember, depending on the size of our Fed business in Q3, it could pop up again as we play out Q4 and beyond. Obviously, we'll let you know as that comes to fruition or not. But yes, it should normalize now in Q3 as expected. Thanks so much, Mike. Yeah. So basically, what that really is showing you is that net new ACV has reaccelerated in first half \u201824 versus first half \u201823. The other piece has nothing to do with early renewals really. The other piece is that are expected on-prem mix in Q3 of this year is lower than \u2013 is a little bit lower than last year. So all good things as you think about the results for Q2 and what it means going forward. Thanks, Matt."

I would now like to turn the call over to Darren Yip, Group Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nDarren Yip: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer.  \n During today's call, we will review our first quarter 2024 results and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that the information discussed on this call, including our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events. Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2023 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.  \n We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. ServiceNow's first quarter results were outstanding. We once again outperformed our guidance across all top line and profitability metrics. \n Subscription revenue grew by 24.5% year-over-year in constant currency. That's approximately 50 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency, 100 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 30%, 150 basis points above our guidance. Even as Q1 is not traditionally a large quarter, we had 8 deals over $5 million in net new ACV, a 100% increase year-over-year. 4 deals were over $10 million, which is a 300% increase year-over-year.  \n ServiceNow is strengthening its position as the AI platform for business transformation. This is fueling strong performances for each of our key businesses. ITSM and ITOM were each in 16 of the top 20 deals. Security and risk, combined, were an 11 of the top 20, customer creator and employee workflows were in 10 of the top 20 deals. GenAI adoption remained on a tear in Q1. Companies are leaning into GenAI as a powerful deflationary force to drive productivity. That's why NNACV for Pro plus is record-breaking. In fact, it's the fastest selling offering in the company's history. \n Iconic brands are adopting ServiceNow's Now Assist AI as a standard for their GenAI road maps. This quarter, we expanded our long-standing partnership with Microsoft to include new generative AI capabilities while also integrating Now Assist AI and Copilot into employee experiences. Really exciting.  \n Hitachi Energy is using case summarization with Now Assist for ITSM to resolve cases faster, saving millions. Equinix is deploying Now Assist AI for HR workflows, aiming to increase agent productivity by 30%. ServiceNow at IBM are combining the power of the Now Platform with Watson X to increase productivity for IBM's employees, customers and partners. BNY Mellon and ServiceNow are exploring the utilization of AI and other leading technologies and IT service management helping to unlock additional value for the bank and its clients.  \n We look forward to further demonstrating the exceptional GenAI customer successes and a detailed road map at our Financial Analyst Day on May 6 in Las Vegas. From an industry perspective, public sector continues to excel globally. Major transactions in Q1 included government of Australia's health department and the government of Italy's IT division, Sogei; the government of Sao Paulo Motor Vehicle Department created an app on ServiceNow to give customers, in that case, citizens, a fast, transparent digital experience that handles requests in minutes.  \n Our global footprint is booming. We're seeing a vast expansion in our most important geographies. This quarter, our Japan team signed the largest NNACV deal in its history. Novartis in Switzerland is implementing ServiceNow GenAI technology to transform the business into one of the most innovative companies in therapeutic medicine. NEOM is harnessing ServiceNow single data model along with other partners to scale its IT services across the Middle East regions while seeking to create the first cognitive city where data-driven intelligence meets urban everyday needs.  \n Suzuki, Tokyo Gas iNet, ANA Systems are all top deals signed in Q1. And this is just scratching the surface of what we achieved this quarter. There's a lot of guesswork out there right now about the geopolitics and economic policies among other things. ServiceNow's philosophy is simple. We focus on the things we can control, building great products, delivering great service for our customers and forging a winning culture, where people can do the best work of their careers. And that's why we perform well when some others don't.  \n It's also why our guidance, as you'll hear from Gina, remains ever strong. Let's talk about the demand environment for enterprise software. AI is not simply a fast maturing technology. AI is a catalyst for business transformation. When I speak to CEOs all over the world, they recognize this is a change moment. Over the past 15 years, enterprise has experienced a massive decentralization of technology governance. As every department became an IT buyer, the result was too many systems, too many apps, low data quality and high vulnerability to cybersecurity risk. And here's the key. Those decisions have been made. So even as CEOs want to consolidate on to strategic platforms for the long term, they also don't want to delay the potential of net new innovation in the short term. They want to derisk the past while getting immediate business value from AI.  \n Process optimization is the #1 GenAI use case in the global economy today. This is why ServiceNow's strategic relevance as the AI platform for business transformation has never been higher. Every business workflow in every enterprise will be engineered with GenAI at its core. We are the single pane of glass that enables end-to-end digital transformation.  \n At ServiceNow, we pride ourselves on being the living embodiment of an AI run company through our Now on Now strategy. Every week that passes the impact of our own Now on Now AI deployments continues to grow. GenAI deflection rates have doubled for both our employees and customers, and they are improving each and every month. Software engineers are accepting 48% of text-to-code generation. These are meaningful productivity improvements, and it's only the beginning. That's why IDC estimates an $11 trillion impact from AI in the next 3 years. It's also why businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on GenAI in 2027, according to IDC. So contrary to some opinions out there, we are witnessing the biggest enterprise software market opportunity in a generation.  \n Business leaders are waking up to the fact that they have a fresh choice now. They can radically simplify the tech stack. We are entering a new frontier. We are in a race to put AI to work for people, and that's a race ServiceNow intends to win for our customers. There's a lot happening at ServiceNow that only heightens our optimism for the remainder of this year and beyond. Our recent Washington, D.C. platform release included very exciting new features for our customers. Now Assist AI for ITOM AIOps supercharges ServiceNow's market-leading solution, applying generative AI to speed up issue resolution.  \n Sales and order management unites the sales order life cycles across the front, middle and back office teams on the ServiceNow platform. ServiceNow is also staying at the forefront of building innovative enterprise GenAI applications.  \n As one example, Now Assist AI for Telecommunications Service Management, what we call TSM, which also uses NVIDIA AI, will boost agent productivity and build on our great partnership. It's also worth noting the ServiceNow research team is stacked with world-renowned AI experts helping our customers stay on the cutting edge. We're expanding our ecosystem capacity to meet growing customer demand.  \n One example is our investment in platformation, a global IT consultancy and leading ServiceNow implementation partner to enhance expertise and generative AI-enabled technology. And anyone who'd like to get the full story, I warmly invite you to join us for Knowledge 2024 in Las Vegas on May 7.  \n In closing, I'll end how I began, the company is in a market-leading position. We have the product recognition from the industry analysts. All of them were showing up on all of the most admired company lists and we're moving up the ranks every year. Those things are always encouraging, and we're proud of it all. But the biggest indication I can give you is qualitative. It's how our team feels about what we're doing together. This culture is different. It's rooted in ServiceNow's earliest days as a customer-obsessed company.  \n We are ever-hungry, ever-humble. So when I'm told that over 1 million people applied to join us last year, I'm not surprised. When you have a galvanizing ambition to become the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century, people want to be a part of that. They recognize this is about more than technology. This is about helping people to know more, care more and do more. We'll continue on this mission in Q2. I'd like to thank all of you for the trust that you've invested in ServiceNow. We're going to keep working hard for you, and we're going to keep striving to honor our brand promise. The world works with ServiceNow.  \n I'll now hand things over to our outstanding CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. \nGina Mastantuono: Thank you, Bill. Q1 set a strong precedent for the year ahead. Building on the momentum from Q4, our team delivered another exceptional outperformance. We surpassed all of our top line and profitability guidance metrics for the quarter. With GenAI conversations serving as a digital transformation catalyst, we see that momentum carrying into Q2.  \n Turning to our results. In Q1, subscription revenues were $2.523 billion, growing 24.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by approximately 50 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $17.7 billion, representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We continue to see average contract terms increase year-over-year as the strategic importance of the Now platform has driven longer duration deals. Current RPO was $8.45 billion, representing 21% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance.  \n From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was extremely robust, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Education had a fantastic quarter, growing nearly 50% year-over-year. Transportation and Logistics, Business and Consumer Services and Retail and Hospitality also saw strength. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98% as the Now platform remains a strategic imperative for our customers' operations.   \n We closed 59 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter with 4 deals greater than $10 million, representing 300% year-over-year growth. Our focus on selling a comprehensive platform continue to drive more multiproduct deals as 15 of our top 20 deals included 7 or more products. We now have 1,933 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. In addition, the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew over 50% year-over-year. \n In Q1, our GenAI products continue to see very healthy adoption. As Bill mentioned, our Pro Plus net new ACV to date continued the trend ahead of any new product family launched for the comparable period. Our GenAI products were in 7 of our top 10 deals, and we closed 7 deals over $1 million in ACV in the quarter. We had wins at a second Wall Street bank, a leading cybersecurity firm and many more, including a significant win for ITOM Pro Plus, which just launched in March. \n Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 30%, approximately 150 basis points above our guidance, driven by the timing of marketing spend, OpEx efficiencies and our top line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 47%, up 12 points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $8.8 billion in cash and investments. In Q1, we bought back 225,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. \n As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $787 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. \n Moving to our guidance. In Q1, we initiated a program to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated revenues. The initiative is expected to lessen the impact of recent movements in the euro and pound, but the incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar has still resulted in FX headwinds compared to our previous guidance. Given our Q1 outperformance, we are raising our 2024 top line outlook to more than offset those moves. \n For 2024, we are raising our subscription revenues by $20 million at the midpoint of the range to more than offset an incremental $17 million headwind from FX. This raises a net increase of $3 million on a narrowed range of $10.560 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, operating margin of 29% and free cash flow margin of 31%. \n Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 208 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $2.525 billion and $2.530 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 22% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20.5%, both on a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 25%. \n Finally, we expect 208 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q1 was a great start to what we expect to be another tremendous year. Organizations are under more pressure than ever to maximize the benefits of the technology investments. In this environment, ServiceNow's traction as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation continues to intensify. GenAI is only as powerful as the platform it's built on. \n The Now platform gives us deep insights with the remarkable ability to tailor AI outputs to the specific needs of our customers. Business users need AI to power actions across the enterprise. Our workflows are designed to do just that, deliver complete solutions to supercharge experiences, creating extraordinary value. You'll hear more about these experiences, our strategy and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 6, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. \n Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I want to thank all of our employees worldwide for helping make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best Places to Work yet again in 2024. ServiceNow's greatest asset is its people, and you all continue to make us, ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this incredible team. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. \nKasthuri Rangan: First earnings report and software for the year, Bill, good to see the optimism. My question on AI is at what point does AI get more broadly adopted, at least from a sales cycle standpoint, that despite the tough economic environment, you can actually draw in more potential prospects into the category because of the cost savings here. And one for Gina, I noticed that -- it's still too early in the year, cRPO, RPO, a bit of seasonality there. Can you give us some insight into what to make of the rest of the year? Congratulations. \nWilliam McDermott: Thank you very much for the question, Kash. As I said, process optimization is the single biggest GenAI use case in the enterprise. And any process that exists in the enterprise today will be reengineered or engineered depending on how messy the process is with GenAI. So every workflow in every enterprise will be rethought. So just think about the sales process, for example, and the whole order to cash process, for example, or think about employees and onboarding and training them and providing all the services to them. Think about agent productivity, which is something that we're obviously moving very quickly on where you can bypass the systems that don't integrate very well. And instead of swivel sharing around or putting customers on hold or I'll get back to you tomorrow, have real-time data where most of the cases are deflected from virtual agent. But if an agent is involved, they have choice A or B, which one is more pleasing to the customer. \n Okay, you like B, you got B. And the case is closed. Think about managing complex cases across an enterprise where all those screens are open and data is being processed instead of having spreadsheets and workarounds and e-mails and text. Now you have everything done on one platform with full case information and case closure. So literally, from running a business in every department to building software, like I said, with the breakthrough on natural language tech turning into code. Every single enterprise will run completely differently because of GenAI and because of our clean sheet platform. \nGina Mastantuono: Yes. And Kash, on your question around seasonality about the cRPO. So first and foremost, really proud of the fact that we beat our guide in Q1 by 100 basis points. That beat was twofold: one, strong net new ACV growth as well as higher early renewals. And so from a seasonality perspective you'll remember, we talked about the Fed duration. And so Q2 is slightly more impacted, right, before it pops up again in Q3. And so we feel really good about the trends that we're seeing. And again, feel really good. We continue to be prudent in our guide around early renewals, while we are seeing them stronger than we saw last year. Again, from a guidance perspective and a forecast perspective, we're continuing to be prudent there. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. \nKarl Keirstead: Bill and Gina, maybe even CJ. I wonder if you could just comment on the environment that you're seeing. I think in prior quarters, you've described it as after a pretty rough, call it, year stretch, it started to stabilize in 3Q and stabilized again in 4Q. Was that still the case in Q1? Were there one or two verticals that maybe lag? Maybe some of the puts and takes about how the environment broadly felt. \nChirantan Desai: So I would say, Karl, I would start first is environment, and we shared this in January, Bill, Gina and I, it remains pretty much the same from our perspective as it -- and what we mean by that, it is not 2021, specifically. So it still takes many approvals and all the things that we discussed from a sales perspective in trying to get business validation done or a purchase being made. And pretty much, I would say, that's a standard across industries and geographies. \n We are absolutely executing well within that environment given our promise of efficiency and automation so that is absolutely resonating and combine that with our in-platform generative AI, which also resonates really well because that is an accelerant to the productivity enhancements that an organization can take. \n So whether it's Wall Street banks, whether it's a life sciences corporation, whether it's governments, that story of automation, digital, productivity, enhance via GenAI is absolutely resonating and that is what is helping us, despite the environment continuing to be the same. \nWilliam McDermott: And I would just build on that, Karl, just for your benefit on the budgets themselves. The budgets are going up. And what I definitely see is the preference for GenAI now. I think we're ending one era in the enterprise, and we've begun another. And we're into a new frontier now where GenAI has opened up the eyes of the customer to say, there might be a different way of doing this. And that's creating real opportunity for us. \n So CJ has it exactly right on the value-based economy, but also I do see the budgets not only going up in IT, but also just see GenAI becoming more of a business imperative. And if you can increase productivity, take cost out and show that in a value case this money that will be spent and maybe different people approving it, but the money will be spent. \n I also want to acknowledge some really great partnerships that we've achieved with Microsoft and IBM and NVIDIA. And I look at great companies like Novartis really rethinking the whole pharma process altogether with GenAI. There's just so much goodness going on in this market. And I feel that you're coming off a strong Q4 to have a great print like this in Q1 with the momentum going into knowledge. I don't think I've ever felt this good in the 5 years that I've been here than I do right now on this call with you right now, absolutely the best I've felt. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. \nMatthew Hedberg: Bill, given your comments on Pro Plus net new ACV growth, are you seeing faster Pro Plus deal cycles relative to what you saw when the Pro was first launched? And anything you just need to call out from a discounting perspective on Pro Plus relative to maybe some of your initial expectations? \nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Matt, I'll take that one. So yes, we are absolutely seeing faster Pro Plus adoption versus Pro. It's 2 quarters out, right? So it's early days, but we feel really good about the adoption curve. And we've been talking about whether or not that adoption curve would be faster. And we posited that it would be, and that's certainly proving out to be the case, although again, early days. \n With respect to discounting versus initial expectations, we feel really good about the realized pricing and it has been very much in line with our initial expectations. And we'll talk a lot more as you would expect at Investor Day about the overall GenAI opportunity for ServiceNow as well as where we are to date. But we feel very good about what we're seeing in the markets. Customers are really leaning in. We talked about 7 deals in the top 10 had GenAI in it, significant deals over $1 million as well. So we're definitely seeing monetization happening already. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities. \nBradley Sills: A question for Gina, please. Real nice results on RPO. I think this is the second quarter since we've seen significant outperformance there versus cRPO. Just curious what's driving that? And does that give you some visibility perhaps for cRPO to ramp from here given perhaps a ramping component in there? \nGina Mastantuono: Yes, it's a great point, and I did call that out. So RPO growth was 27% year-over-year in constant currency, which is 300 basis points improvement versus last year. And yes, that is our longer-term backlog. So as you think more longer term about the opportunity in ServiceNow, I couldn't be more excited about that. We are seeing the average duration growing. And in fact, duration this Q1 is the largest it's been in the Q1 since, I think, 2019. And so I feel really good about what that means for the mid- and long-term opportunity here for sure. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. \nSanjit Singh: Sanjit Singh in for Keith Weiss. Bill, I wanted to ask a little bit about GenAI adoption within ServiceNow, you mentioned Now on Now, but in terms of just like the GenAI adoption, both broadly and with the engineering team, it looks like you're hiring for this quarter in R&D, you kept a pace. How is GenAI adoption changing or not changing your hiring plans more broadly and specifically in the engineering team? \nChirantan Desai: This is CJ. And here is where I would say that specifically, we absolutely believe, and we have seen it that GenAI is helping our software engineers code faster. I mean, straight up. It helps us our software engineers code faster, whether they are junior software engineers or very senior software engineers, they still can leverage and continue to leverage generative AI. So I'll start with that, that is increasing our engineering productivity and it varies depending on how senior the engineer is or how junior the engineer is. And number two, it helps us increase our innovation velocity. So that is really, really important to us that it increases our innovation velocity. \n When I flip that for our customers is that when customers leverage ServiceNow generative AI, and if they can do automation faster, whether he's using text to code or text to workflow types of use cases that they can not only increase the number of workflows that they put on ServiceNow, but second, it also increases that digital efficiency. So it's both ways. Our engineers are able to innovate faster and then our customers are able to workflow faster because of generative AI. \nWilliam McDermott: And one thing just to share with you, Keith (sic) [ Sanjit ], we have 20 -- 20 GenAI cases on the Now on Now story within ServiceNow. And our Chief Information Officer, Chris Bedi, put a very interesting LinkedIn post out there. Please take a look at it. Not only is he doing a great job. But if you think about ServiceNow, we have a financial system in ServiceNow. It's a system of record. We have one of them. Unlike many customers out there that have hundreds, we have a CRM system. We have one of them. And we have an HR system. We have one of them. But they are feeding the ServiceNow platform. \n So all the data from those systems of record in terms of how we run this company, we run the whole company on ServiceNow. And now we have 20 different GenAI use cases across all the departments of the company. So my full expectation is that someday, we could do the earnings call where we're all in this room together and we'll take you through the living, learning lab of a GenAI-run company here at ServiceNow. \nGina Mastantuono: Yes. And I would just add -- I think I would just add, we are absolutely customer 0, 100% on all of our GenAI use cases. Deflection rates have doubled for both our employees and customers and they're improving every month. Right? It's really early days. So it's learning faster and faster. Software engineers are accepting 48% of text to code generation. So there's absolutely the ability to see leverage in our R&D as we look to the mid- and long term. So thank you for the question. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO. \nKeith Bachman: I have two questions, but I'll ask them as one. First, Gina, I don't know if this is for you or not, but acknowledge that the adoption does seem quite strong for the various GenAI offerings, and so how would you characterize? And yet you're pointing to decelerating growth through 2024. So what's not growing as well? If GenAI is getting great adoption, probably small dollar amounts contribution. But what's not growing as well? \n And the second part is perhaps going to come at the Analyst Day, but is there any specific metrics you could give us on dollars of ACV or anything else related to the GenAI SKUs? Or should we wait for Analyst Day perhaps to some more specific indications on what the adoption is? \nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So we'll definitely give you a lot more details on all things GenAI at Investor Day, and that's in a week and a bit. So stay tuned there. Yes, the adoption curve is stronger than we've seen in any new product category launch, but that's starting from 0, right? So it's a small dollar at this point in time, but the speed at which it's going to grow to be a really meaningful contributor is faster than anything we've seen. \n And so what I'd say is that 24.5% revenue growth at the scale at which we are, the larger numbers is pretty incredible. And we see continued traction across the board, whether it's our technology workflows, our customer workflows or our creator as well. And so really across the board, employees had a really strong quarter, customer had a really strong quarter. ITSM core remains healthy in 16 of our top 20 deals, 10 deals over $1 million. ITOM was included also in 16 of the top 20 deals with 9 deals over $1 million, security and risk in totality, still doing well. And so it's the great thing about having a platform with the breadth that ServiceNow has, that we continue to drive really, really good growth at our scale across the platform. \nChirantan Desai: Yes. And the only thing I would add there is every single workflow continues to still grow double digits plus, plus. So we have no, hey, this has been taken out of x or this been taken out of y besides Gina individually calling out all our growth vectors, whether it's our core, which is ITSM and ITOM or whether it's our growth, which our CSM and other products, AppEngine, part of creator and customer, all of them continue to grow very nicely, and they grew very nicely in Q1. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. \nTyler Radke: I wanted to ask you how you're seeing the momentum just in terms of Standard to Pro migrations. We talked a lot about Pro Plus, but it would seem that still a huge opportunity in terms of, I think, close to 50% of the installed base on Standard. Have you started to see an acceleration in those migrations? Can you just talk about the opportunity there? \nChirantan Desai: So first, I'll use, Tyler, one quick example that I was in a conversation at a bank, very technical audience in their technology organization. They were still on ITSM Standard. Once they saw what we have done with Pro plus, they actually bought Pro and Pro Plus together. And that is just amazing that they bought both technologies together, not just saying, \"hey, I'm going to go to Pro and then staircase to Pro Plus.\" That's a very specific example. But the way we look at this specific product line, whether it's ITSM or whether it's CSM, our customer service, is I look at both Pro and Enterprise in total. \n So when I look at Pro and Enterprise in total, so I'm excluding Pro Plus on purpose here, so Pro and Enterprise, which are the bigger SKUs at a higher priced amount, they grew nicely for ITSM, for CSM, for our HR Service Delivery. Three of our anchor businesses, when you combine Pro and Enterprise, that is still a high-growth business and then you add Pro Plus, that's what allows us, at this scale of $2.52 billion to grow at 24.5%. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. \nGregg Moskowitz: Bill, getting back to the topic of IT budgets as it relates to ServiceNow broadly, you took a sense of how much of GenAI software spend is incremental today as opposed to perhaps coming from other areas of IT. \nWilliam McDermott: Yes. It's a really important question, Gregg. I really believe the IT budgets in their own right will go up on a standard rate basis as we've seen now for many, many years. The business executives, however, are inserting their will into the generative AI revolution because the CEO is in a boardroom with her senior team sitting around a table with the Board of Directors, and they're like, \"hey, what are you guys doing on GenAI?\" And they know now that they got to go into that room with a story because this is a lot like when we had the internet, then we had the iPhone moment, everything went mobile. Everything is going GenAI. It's just a question of how quickly you get there. \n So I believe that a lot of the business operating spend will be moved to GenAI technology use cases that serve the business. And the reason I believe I'm right on that, if you look at great companies, some of them in this quarter like Microsoft and Novartis, so Hitachi Energy or Equinix or IBM, they're looking at this as, hey, what does this mean to my employees, to my customers, to my partners and they're very well aware of the fact that inflation is sticky and rates are high, and they're on their own. \n They've got to deal with this stuff. And the only way to change the game is to rethink the game and move from checkers to chess and GenAI is now opening up the window for transformational conversations. And that's why I say we are the AI platform for business transformation because we're using technology to transform the business, how can the business run at a lower cost. They're asking questions like, why am I on several different releases on-premise and in cloud and why do I have all these systems? I need a system for every 1,000 employees, it's ridiculous. \n So they want to rethink things. And so I think there's two things that are going to happen: one is business budget is going to move into the GenAI category, and it's not going to take away from the IT spend in the end; and two, there's going to be real winners and real losers. And real winners and real losers has already begun its formation because if you don't plant the AI flag in the ground in the next 8 months, there's not going to be an AI flag to put in the ground and ours are getting put in the ground all over the global economy. And the company that I see out there doing extremely well in that regard is what Microsoft is doing with Copilot. \n And I see what we are doing with Now Assist AI. And I think it's the combination of those 2 players in the enterprise. And obviously, you've got the great ones like NVIDIA and so forth that's building the GPU force, but that is really what I'm seeing. And I'm also super honored this quarter to see IBM really jump in as a friend and a partner with ServiceNow, and we feel the same way about Watson X. And we're very open to all the participants that are making LLMs and they can all integrate with ServiceNow, and we'll own the domain specific to ServiceNow, but we welcome all participants. And I think that's another unique part of ServiceNow that we're not interested in shutting anybody out. We're actually technology capable enough to open up to everybody and that's really turning on the whole ecosystem in our favor. So plants are being put in flags in the ground in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the way to Japan and beyond. We are winning. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. I do apologize. It looks like Mark has disconnected. We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. \nBrad Zelnick: It's great to hear all the traction in international. You called out deals in Australia, Italy, Brazil. But I want to focus, Bill, on what you just mentioned about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where in your press release, you called out a $500 million investment in that market given obviously it's a massive, massive opportunity. Gina, can you double-click into the $500 million investment you're making over what time period, where it lands on the financials? And maybe more generally, how should we think about your strategic use of capital and CapEx for these types of deals? \nGina Mastantuono: Brad, thanks so much for the question. So we're really excited about the investment in Saudi. And rest assured, that $500 million is a long-term investment over a long horizon period. It will be in -- most of that investment is in data center, so it will be in cost of sales, but you'll -- again, we manage our margin very tightly. And the growth that we're from that investment is huge. The opportunity that we see in Riyadh and Saudi, NEOM, is great. And Bill spent a nice time there at the LEAP conference, and we're really excited about really pulling our technology to really help that society grow and become a digital-first economy. \n And they're leaning in very heavy with ServiceNow, are really excited about our product portfolio, not only our GenAI, but really the breadth of the entirety of the portfolio. So it will be within our CapEx guide that you have always seen, it's not on top of, and we're just really excited about planning flags more in the Middle East. \nOperator: And Mark Murphy has dialed back in. We will go to Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. \nMark Murphy: Bill, I'm curious how you're looking at the onboarding of talent into the ServiceNow ecosystem because we're being told that the demand for ServiceNow consultants, is that a multiyear high. We're wondering if the economy can create those jobs quickly enough to keep up with the bookings that you're driving. And just also, is there a pivot point coming where you would want to crank up your own hiring engine within ServiceNow to keep up with the top line growth? \nWilliam McDermott: Yes. First of all, Mark, thank you very much. Incidentally, my compliments on the research that you put out. I read your e-mail this morning and you called the quarter exactly as it was. So super well done on your part, not surprising considering the great company you work for. \n I will give you a couple of things. Leadership is everything. We just hired a great leader who is leading our training initiatives globally, both internally and externally, world renowned and she is going to drive not only a knowledge revolution within our own company but also within the ecosystem. And no, we're not going to build a services company here. We're very comfortable with the ecosystem and building out the ecosystem. We made a commitment with rise up with ServiceNow that we have 1 million people trained around the world on the ServiceNow platform, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. \n I talked about platformation as one company that probably not everybody on this call ever heard of, but you know all the big ones, and they're all investing huge human capital contributions and some of them have literally multi, multibillion business plans built with ServiceNow. So we really like the fact that we can impact the customers' value case with our ServiceNow Six Sigma knowledge team and then we can extend the feet on the street through the ecosystem and also the trust that we have with the ecosystem where they know we're not trying to duplicate their business models on the contrary. \n We need them to invest in their business models to move our ambition to be the defining one forward. So it's a really good question actually. And you are right, we're working really hard at it, but it's also true for you to know that the partners see the opportunity like never before, and they're doubling down on ServiceNow. So we think we got a good formed strategy, and we think that we are going to be able to cover this global economy, and we're moving at warp speed to do so. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. \nSamad Samana: I guess, Bill, I wanted to follow up a little bit to Mark's question because sales and marketing hiring in the first quarter was basically as many heads as you did the last 3 quarters of 2023. And I know there's some seasonality to it, but is that you guys ramping hiring back up as you see more demand? Is it a certain type of salesperson that you need as you think of more AI-driven sales? Just maybe help us understand what you saw in 1Q and maybe the philosophy around it. \nWilliam McDermott: Yes. Samad, we see the biggest opportunity we've ever seen. And we know the GenAI revolution is real, and we're doubling down. What you're seeing our investments are very focused on building the best software in the world, and selling the best software in the world. So we have great leadership on both the engineering side and the go-to-market side and we're going to have more clarity of focus in the way we drive the go-to-market. \n Now we're getting to size and scale the calls for that. So there are various motions to market that will have single line of sight accountability and responsibility for a number and the accountability can't be stressed highly enough because we need leaders that can run businesses here. And that's what really big leaders want to do anyway. And Gina rightfully pointed out, we don't do anything without the margin in mind. So we have a pipeline. We manage the whole company on something we call the CEO of Dashboard. We are in real time with a rolling 4-quarter average pipe. We have our GenAI use cases that are against that pipe based on the stage of the sales cycle. \n So we know how many we can afford to hire based on probability of closure within 1% to 2%, and that is how we drive the financial performance of the company and how many people we let in the door. I do want to stress because we run a clean platform here and we run a GenAI company here. That's our absolute commitment. \n We are going to run a super efficient company. So on the G&A side of the equation, we continue to be lean and as we get bigger as a percent of revenue, that will drop even further. So I think you're going to like that. And I think a lot of companies now are showing up here at our doorstep, they want to see the Now on Now story because they're like, how is it that you could have one financial system for thousands and thousands and one HR system and one CRM system, when my company has hundreds and I can't even keep track of them all. And I think a lot of what I'm trying to explain to you is we're in the beginning stages of the end of one era and the beginning of another. \nGina Mastantuono: And I would just add to that, Samad. I would just add that last year, might have looked like we slowed down sales and marketing, but there's a lot in that number, and we talked about this, a lot of operations, sales ops. And we actually were very focused even last year on continuing to hire quota-bearing feet on the street sales folks. We're entering -- we entered 2024 with the higher -- the highest increase in ramp reps that we have in a while. \n So yes, we will be reaccelerating. We feel really good about pipe. We feel really good about demand. And so -- but I want to make clear that we didn't stop hiring salespeople feet on the street. Last year, we continue to hire and we will continue to do that because our pipe looks strong and demand looks great. \nSamad Samana: Very helpful. And then Gina, I had a quick follow-up for you. On cRPO, you mentioned, I think, in response to another question about maybe some early renewals in 1Q. Can you maybe just help us understand if it was material enough to impact the Q2 guidance or just I know the guidance was good, but just trying to think through on that timing, if there's anything we should consider for 2Q and then maybe even the back half based on your expectations on renewals? \nGina Mastantuono: Yes. So if you remember, Samad, last year, we've been -- over the last year, we've been more prudent in how we've been forecasting early renewals because it's hard to forecast. It's very customer specific and customer by customer. And so in Q1, our beat was really strong on our net new ACV growth, but we also saw early renewals than our prudent forecast. I haven't changed how we're thinking about forecasting. I'm still remaining prudent given the macro. And so as we think about seasonality. I talked about Q2 being lower, slightly lower, but then it bounced back up in Q3 when Fed is our strong quarter. And so again, it wasn't material enough to impact the Q2 guidance, but I'm not assuming better early renewals in Q2 like we saw in Q1. \nSamad Samana: Awesome. See you guys in a week and a bit. \nWilliam McDermott: By the way, Samad, when you show up, you'll notice that it will be a stunning knowledge, and you'll see thousands more people than you saw last year. We just keep getting bigger and bigger. So get ready for the best Vegas show you've ever seen. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. \nPatrick Walravens: Bill and CJ, can you help us understand how important it is to have and release your own LLM, so you guys had StarCoder in February, Databricks' DBRX in March? I'll just say Snowflake did their Arctic family. \nChirantan Desai: I would say it is extremely important, Patrick, is the simple answer. Here are the three things we are solving for with our own LLMs. First of all, they are use case specific. And ServiceNow has many use cases that are used by our customers, whether it's IT service management, customer service, our ITOM, all of our key product lines. These are use case specific. And sometimes you would say, even for what Bill talked about agent summarization and other things or text to code, we always want use case-specific LLMs. \n So then the question is why. One, the accuracy is higher; number two, these are smaller models which are efficient to run, as you have seen, our gross margin guidance that Gina provided that we feel comfortable with the cost to run these models because when the models are smaller, the cost to run them is not high; and number three, from an end user perspective, a smaller model always performs better. So I consider this as a unique strategy that we are fortunate to have a great AI teams at ServiceNow, focused on not only the engineering execution, but combine that with research and experience on how our customers will consume Pro Plus, these things matter. And that's why domain-specific SLMs, small language models, is the right strategy for ServiceNow. We can run it in our cloud, customers' data is protected, and they have higher throughput and get higher value. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. \nJohn DiFucci: Bill, you both talked about the strong government across the world and emphasizing international. I know the U.S. government is strong for you. And I suppose it's still pretty good for you. But Gina, you didn't mention it in the list of verticals that did well this quarter. Can you comment a little bit more on the U.S. federal government and what you expect for the rest of the year? \nGina Mastantuono: Absolutely, John. Thanks for the question. I didn't mention it because we had such great results in so many other industries and sectors. But our federal business also was strong and had its biggest Q1 ever with $8 million plus deals and net new ACV growth that accelerated. And so we hosted our largest Fed forum ever with customers representing more than $1 billion in ACV and triple the number of attendees at our executive circle and over 35 partner sponsorships and so really strong federal business. And actually, our GenAI offerings are reinforcing our ability to help accelerate the transformation journey for our federal customers. And so we're seeing early adopters and healthy industry -- sorry, healthy interest in our domain specific models, which offer better security that CJ just talked about and really can drive tremendous efficiency gains. And so exciting themes ahead for 2024 and feel really good about what the federal business will continue to do for us as well as public sector as a whole. So thanks so much for the question. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ethan Bruck with Wolfe Research. \nAleksandr Zukin: This is Alex Zukin from Wolfe. Maybe just the question that you guys have gotten a couple of times on Pro Plus adoption. Listen, it's very clear that the enthusiasm is there, the interest level is there. You talked about it at length in terms of the new product launch being the fastest ever. Is there a way to kind of stratify? Or at a high level, just give us a sense for what percentage of your deals or pipeline either for Q1 included Pro Plus? And how it looks for the rest of the year? And how like that compares to your kind of expectations when you set on this journey? And then I've got a quick follow-up. \nChirantan Desai: Alex, great to hear from you. So I'll take this on. So there are a couple of things we are seeing. So when we launched Pro in 2018 September, and we launched Pro Plus in 2023 September. As Bill outlined in his comments, the Pro Plus uptake by our customers is at a higher pace than Pro uptake was across not only just ITSM, but also CSM and also HR, which are 3 big product lines for ServiceNow. So when you look at exactly 2 quarters and 2 days that we have been in the market, it has exceeded our internal projections on what Pro Plus will do and our ability to sell them. And as Gina outlined, that not only it was in the 7 out of 10 deals, which are the top deals for ServiceNow in Q1, we had $7 million-plus deals, including public sector deals in a regulated environment where our engineers have made the technology work for this regulated environment. \n So overall, when I see what is happening on the demand environment, it is at a higher pace given very clear metrics around productivity for whether it's IT agents, customer service agents, HR staff, or for the employees. And that's what is driving the demand because it accelerates the productivity or multiplies it however you want to call it. \n The second thing I would say is when I look out Q2, Q3, Q4, I still see significant interest from customers, and they are saying, okay, CJ, what's going on with the customers who purchased this in, say, for example, Q4. Now here is a really positive news that I do want to report, and we will share more details at our Financial Analyst Day, Alex, is that customers are, for the first time very eager to turn on Pro Plus and want to see and work with us on where the productivity improvements they are seeing and say, help us understand, I saw that when a call got transferred from one IT agent to the other IT agent on follow-the-sun model, the quick summarization help them significantly, so they didn't ask the end user same question. So there are a lot of nuances we are learning as we work with our customers, but they are deploying. And when I say deploying, as in implementing Pro Plus at a much faster rate than Pro, which is allowing us and our sales team to use this as an example, while convincing other customers to sell. \n So overall, not only the demand environment I'm seeing is better for Pro Plus than Pro, if you ask me the same question in 2019 April, which was 5 years ago. But I'm also seeing that customers are turning on Pro Plus and working with us saying, here is where I'm seeing the improvement. Here is how I should think about it. And our engineering teams are doing a phenomenal job releasing improvements literally on a monthly basis to make sure that our customers are successful with Pro Plus. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. \nMichael Turrin: I appreciate you squeezing me in. Gina, 47% free cash flow margin certainly stands out, maybe walk us through the drivers of strength there for Q1. Anything onetime for us to consider? And maybe just given we're holding on to the margin guide for the year, just how we should think about seasonality of free cash flow throughout the rest of the year. \nGina Mastantuono: Yes. Thanks, Michael, for noticing. We're really proud of the 47% free cash flow margin. Year-over-year, though, you have to remember that Q1 of last year was lower than normal given the Silicon Valley Bank and regional bank crisis that happened that quarter. All of that being said, even if you normalize for that, we are significantly higher. And that's testament to the strong margin, operating margin and some nice work that we've been doing on working capital efficiencies. And so we feel really good. Seasonality for free cash flow will be similar to what you've seen historically. And so just really strong results. The team has done an outstanding job on working capital efficiencies, and we'll continue to see that as well. \nOperator: And we have time for one last question. We'll take our last question from Derrick Wood with Cowen. \nJames Wood: Great. CJ, just to kind of follow-up on that last discussion. Just in terms of how you're seeing adoption of GenAI. I guess on one end of the spectrum, perhaps it's easy to drop this into the hands of workers, let them experiment quickly figure out how to drive productivity. On the other end of the spectrum, perhaps there's a lot of data hygiene investments needed. You need SIs to come in and help drive real process change and really drive the learning curve. I guess where do you guys -- what end of the spectrum are you seeing when it comes to adopting LLMs within the ServiceNow platform? \nChirantan Desai: So first of all, thanks for the question, Derrick. Here is how I would describe it. Our design goals and engineering goals were, this has to be super simple to turn it on, as in Pro Plus, once you are on Pro, and you can start using our Pro Plus capabilities, whether it's for agents, employees and so on. That has been our design principle. The setup is super simple, and customers are turning it on and seeing where they are seeing improvements on productivity, whether it's for agents or employees. So that's number one. \n Number two, I absolutely do not expect that this requires a heavy system integrator types of implementation that is drawn out in the old machine learning technologies, where you create a model, refine a model and you need data scientists, machine learning engineers and so on. This is pretty straightforward for ServiceNow use cases. Where system integrators can help is what Bill talked about that, hey, is there a new way to look at this process? And should I even put in another process on ServiceNow platform because I can see this is just super fast to get value out of ServiceNow. \n So in terms of implementation cycles, they are actually faster on Pro Plus than they have ever been before. And we don't expect a heavy implementation cost. However, if our customers want to leverage system integrators, the biggest value that they always had is helping them think through what additional generative AI use cases they can use and redefining processes. \nWilliam McDermott: And Derrick, I would just give you one thing to think about, too. You could take great companies like Novartis, who want to be a global leader in their industry. And that industry has been held back with 6.5-year clinical trials. And these kinds of CEOs are rethinking everything and they're using generative AI as the gateway to change. And they're looking at not only GenAI, but they're also looking at ServiceNow as a fresh new platform design to take on some of the tougher process challenges that has slowed companies down. And as CJ said, which I think is a major point, the time to implementation on these GenAI use cases has been faster than anything I've seen, not just against Pro, but against anything. \n They want it in now. So there's an urgency and that urgency is coming from the C-suite, and it's a movement. And I've never seen a desire for implementation speed like I have for GenAI. And that, to me, is a big factor as you navigate and the way you think about this business, this business model and GenAI is a category, who's going to win, who's going to lose and which customers really want the solution, how quickly do they want the solution if they see the value they want it yesterday, and that's a great sign for us. \nOperator: Thank you. And with that, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "William McDermott",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Darren, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. ServiceNow's first quarter results were outstanding. We once again outperformed our guidance across all top line and profitability metrics. \n Subscription revenue grew by 24.5% year-over-year in constant currency. That's approximately 50 basis points above the high end of our guidance. CRPO grew 21% year-over-year in constant currency, 100 basis points above our guidance. Operating margin was over 30%, 150 basis points above our guidance. Even as Q1 is not traditionally a large quarter, we had 8 deals over $5 million in net new ACV, a 100% increase year-over-year. 4 deals were over $10 million, which is a 300% increase year-over-year.  \n ServiceNow is strengthening its position as the AI platform for business transformation. This is fueling strong performances for each of our key businesses. ITSM and ITOM were each in 16 of the top 20 deals. Security and risk, combined, were an 11 of the top 20, customer creator and employee workflows were in 10 of the top 20 deals. GenAI adoption remained on a tear in Q1. Companies are leaning into GenAI as a powerful deflationary force to drive productivity. That's why NNACV for Pro plus is record-breaking. In fact, it's the fastest selling offering in the company's history. \n Iconic brands are adopting ServiceNow's Now Assist AI as a standard for their GenAI road maps. This quarter, we expanded our long-standing partnership with Microsoft to include new generative AI capabilities while also integrating Now Assist AI and Copilot into employee experiences. Really exciting.  \n Hitachi Energy is using case summarization with Now Assist for ITSM to resolve cases faster, saving millions. Equinix is deploying Now Assist AI for HR workflows, aiming to increase agent productivity by 30%. ServiceNow at IBM are combining the power of the Now Platform with Watson X to increase productivity for IBM's employees, customers and partners. BNY Mellon and ServiceNow are exploring the utilization of AI and other leading technologies and IT service management helping to unlock additional value for the bank and its clients.  \n We look forward to further demonstrating the exceptional GenAI customer successes and a detailed road map at our Financial Analyst Day on May 6 in Las Vegas. From an industry perspective, public sector continues to excel globally. Major transactions in Q1 included government of Australia's health department and the government of Italy's IT division, Sogei; the government of Sao Paulo Motor Vehicle Department created an app on ServiceNow to give customers, in that case, citizens, a fast, transparent digital experience that handles requests in minutes.  \n Our global footprint is booming. We're seeing a vast expansion in our most important geographies. This quarter, our Japan team signed the largest NNACV deal in its history. Novartis in Switzerland is implementing ServiceNow GenAI technology to transform the business into one of the most innovative companies in therapeutic medicine. NEOM is harnessing ServiceNow single data model along with other partners to scale its IT services across the Middle East regions while seeking to create the first cognitive city where data-driven intelligence meets urban everyday needs.  \n Suzuki, Tokyo Gas iNet, ANA Systems are all top deals signed in Q1. And this is just scratching the surface of what we achieved this quarter. There's a lot of guesswork out there right now about the geopolitics and economic policies among other things. ServiceNow's philosophy is simple. We focus on the things we can control, building great products, delivering great service for our customers and forging a winning culture, where people can do the best work of their careers. And that's why we perform well when some others don't.  \n It's also why our guidance, as you'll hear from Gina, remains ever strong. Let's talk about the demand environment for enterprise software. AI is not simply a fast maturing technology. AI is a catalyst for business transformation. When I speak to CEOs all over the world, they recognize this is a change moment. Over the past 15 years, enterprise has experienced a massive decentralization of technology governance. As every department became an IT buyer, the result was too many systems, too many apps, low data quality and high vulnerability to cybersecurity risk. And here's the key. Those decisions have been made. So even as CEOs want to consolidate on to strategic platforms for the long term, they also don't want to delay the potential of net new innovation in the short term. They want to derisk the past while getting immediate business value from AI.  \n Process optimization is the #1 GenAI use case in the global economy today. This is why ServiceNow's strategic relevance as the AI platform for business transformation has never been higher. Every business workflow in every enterprise will be engineered with GenAI at its core. We are the single pane of glass that enables end-to-end digital transformation.  \n At ServiceNow, we pride ourselves on being the living embodiment of an AI run company through our Now on Now strategy. Every week that passes the impact of our own Now on Now AI deployments continues to grow. GenAI deflection rates have doubled for both our employees and customers, and they are improving each and every month. Software engineers are accepting 48% of text-to-code generation. These are meaningful productivity improvements, and it's only the beginning. That's why IDC estimates an $11 trillion impact from AI in the next 3 years. It's also why businesses will spend more than $0.5 trillion on GenAI in 2027, according to IDC. So contrary to some opinions out there, we are witnessing the biggest enterprise software market opportunity in a generation.  \n Business leaders are waking up to the fact that they have a fresh choice now. They can radically simplify the tech stack. We are entering a new frontier. We are in a race to put AI to work for people, and that's a race ServiceNow intends to win for our customers. There's a lot happening at ServiceNow that only heightens our optimism for the remainder of this year and beyond. Our recent Washington, D.C. platform release included very exciting new features for our customers. Now Assist AI for ITOM AIOps supercharges ServiceNow's market-leading solution, applying generative AI to speed up issue resolution.  \n Sales and order management unites the sales order life cycles across the front, middle and back office teams on the ServiceNow platform. ServiceNow is also staying at the forefront of building innovative enterprise GenAI applications.  \n As one example, Now Assist AI for Telecommunications Service Management, what we call TSM, which also uses NVIDIA AI, will boost agent productivity and build on our great partnership. It's also worth noting the ServiceNow research team is stacked with world-renowned AI experts helping our customers stay on the cutting edge. We're expanding our ecosystem capacity to meet growing customer demand.  \n One example is our investment in platformation, a global IT consultancy and leading ServiceNow implementation partner to enhance expertise and generative AI-enabled technology. And anyone who'd like to get the full story, I warmly invite you to join us for Knowledge 2024 in Las Vegas on May 7.  \n In closing, I'll end how I began, the company is in a market-leading position. We have the product recognition from the industry analysts. All of them were showing up on all of the most admired company lists and we're moving up the ranks every year. Those things are always encouraging, and we're proud of it all. But the biggest indication I can give you is qualitative. It's how our team feels about what we're doing together. This culture is different. It's rooted in ServiceNow's earliest days as a customer-obsessed company.  \n We are ever-hungry, ever-humble. So when I'm told that over 1 million people applied to join us last year, I'm not surprised. When you have a galvanizing ambition to become the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century, people want to be a part of that. They recognize this is about more than technology. This is about helping people to know more, care more and do more. We'll continue on this mission in Q2. I'd like to thank all of you for the trust that you've invested in ServiceNow. We're going to keep working hard for you, and we're going to keep striving to honor our brand promise. The world works with ServiceNow.  \n I'll now hand things over to our outstanding CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Thank you very much for the question, Kash. As I said, process optimization is the single biggest GenAI use case in the enterprise. And any process that exists in the enterprise today will be reengineered or engineered depending on how messy the process is with GenAI. So every workflow in every enterprise will be rethought. So just think about the sales process, for example, and the whole order to cash process, for example, or think about employees and onboarding and training them and providing all the services to them. Think about agent productivity, which is something that we're obviously moving very quickly on where you can bypass the systems that don't integrate very well. And instead of swivel sharing around or putting customers on hold or I'll get back to you tomorrow, have real-time data where most of the cases are deflected from virtual agent. But if an agent is involved, they have choice A or B, which one is more pleasing to the customer. \n Okay, you like B, you got B. And the case is closed. Think about managing complex cases across an enterprise where all those screens are open and data is being processed instead of having spreadsheets and workarounds and e-mails and text. Now you have everything done on one platform with full case information and case closure. So literally, from running a business in every department to building software, like I said, with the breakthrough on natural language tech turning into code. Every single enterprise will run completely differently because of GenAI and because of our clean sheet platform. And I would just build on that, Karl, just for your benefit on the budgets themselves. The budgets are going up. And what I definitely see is the preference for GenAI now. I think we're ending one era in the enterprise, and we've begun another. And we're into a new frontier now where GenAI has opened up the eyes of the customer to say, there might be a different way of doing this. And that's creating real opportunity for us. \n So CJ has it exactly right on the value-based economy, but also I do see the budgets not only going up in IT, but also just see GenAI becoming more of a business imperative. And if you can increase productivity, take cost out and show that in a value case this money that will be spent and maybe different people approving it, but the money will be spent. \n I also want to acknowledge some really great partnerships that we've achieved with Microsoft and IBM and NVIDIA. And I look at great companies like Novartis really rethinking the whole pharma process altogether with GenAI. There's just so much goodness going on in this market. And I feel that you're coming off a strong Q4 to have a great print like this in Q1 with the momentum going into knowledge. I don't think I've ever felt this good in the 5 years that I've been here than I do right now on this call with you right now, absolutely the best I've felt. And one thing just to share with you, Keith (sic) [ Sanjit ], we have 20 -- 20 GenAI cases on the Now on Now story within ServiceNow. And our Chief Information Officer, Chris Bedi, put a very interesting LinkedIn post out there. Please take a look at it. Not only is he doing a great job. But if you think about ServiceNow, we have a financial system in ServiceNow. It's a system of record. We have one of them. Unlike many customers out there that have hundreds, we have a CRM system. We have one of them. And we have an HR system. We have one of them. But they are feeding the ServiceNow platform. \n So all the data from those systems of record in terms of how we run this company, we run the whole company on ServiceNow. And now we have 20 different GenAI use cases across all the departments of the company. So my full expectation is that someday, we could do the earnings call where we're all in this room together and we'll take you through the living, learning lab of a GenAI-run company here at ServiceNow. Yes. It's a really important question, Gregg. I really believe the IT budgets in their own right will go up on a standard rate basis as we've seen now for many, many years. The business executives, however, are inserting their will into the generative AI revolution because the CEO is in a boardroom with her senior team sitting around a table with the Board of Directors, and they're like, \"hey, what are you guys doing on GenAI?\" And they know now that they got to go into that room with a story because this is a lot like when we had the internet, then we had the iPhone moment, everything went mobile. Everything is going GenAI. It's just a question of how quickly you get there. \n So I believe that a lot of the business operating spend will be moved to GenAI technology use cases that serve the business. And the reason I believe I'm right on that, if you look at great companies, some of them in this quarter like Microsoft and Novartis, so Hitachi Energy or Equinix or IBM, they're looking at this as, hey, what does this mean to my employees, to my customers, to my partners and they're very well aware of the fact that inflation is sticky and rates are high, and they're on their own. \n They've got to deal with this stuff. And the only way to change the game is to rethink the game and move from checkers to chess and GenAI is now opening up the window for transformational conversations. And that's why I say we are the AI platform for business transformation because we're using technology to transform the business, how can the business run at a lower cost. They're asking questions like, why am I on several different releases on-premise and in cloud and why do I have all these systems? I need a system for every 1,000 employees, it's ridiculous. \n So they want to rethink things. And so I think there's two things that are going to happen: one is business budget is going to move into the GenAI category, and it's not going to take away from the IT spend in the end; and two, there's going to be real winners and real losers. And real winners and real losers has already begun its formation because if you don't plant the AI flag in the ground in the next 8 months, there's not going to be an AI flag to put in the ground and ours are getting put in the ground all over the global economy. And the company that I see out there doing extremely well in that regard is what Microsoft is doing with Copilot. \n And I see what we are doing with Now Assist AI. And I think it's the combination of those 2 players in the enterprise. And obviously, you've got the great ones like NVIDIA and so forth that's building the GPU force, but that is really what I'm seeing. And I'm also super honored this quarter to see IBM really jump in as a friend and a partner with ServiceNow, and we feel the same way about Watson X. And we're very open to all the participants that are making LLMs and they can all integrate with ServiceNow, and we'll own the domain specific to ServiceNow, but we welcome all participants. And I think that's another unique part of ServiceNow that we're not interested in shutting anybody out. We're actually technology capable enough to open up to everybody and that's really turning on the whole ecosystem in our favor. So plants are being put in flags in the ground in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the way to Japan and beyond. We are winning. Yes. First of all, Mark, thank you very much. Incidentally, my compliments on the research that you put out. I read your e-mail this morning and you called the quarter exactly as it was. So super well done on your part, not surprising considering the great company you work for. \n I will give you a couple of things. Leadership is everything. We just hired a great leader who is leading our training initiatives globally, both internally and externally, world renowned and she is going to drive not only a knowledge revolution within our own company but also within the ecosystem. And no, we're not going to build a services company here. We're very comfortable with the ecosystem and building out the ecosystem. We made a commitment with rise up with ServiceNow that we have 1 million people trained around the world on the ServiceNow platform, and we're well on our way to achieving that goal. \n I talked about platformation as one company that probably not everybody on this call ever heard of, but you know all the big ones, and they're all investing huge human capital contributions and some of them have literally multi, multibillion business plans built with ServiceNow. So we really like the fact that we can impact the customers' value case with our ServiceNow Six Sigma knowledge team and then we can extend the feet on the street through the ecosystem and also the trust that we have with the ecosystem where they know we're not trying to duplicate their business models on the contrary. \n We need them to invest in their business models to move our ambition to be the defining one forward. So it's a really good question actually. And you are right, we're working really hard at it, but it's also true for you to know that the partners see the opportunity like never before, and they're doubling down on ServiceNow. So we think we got a good formed strategy, and we think that we are going to be able to cover this global economy, and we're moving at warp speed to do so. Yes. Samad, we see the biggest opportunity we've ever seen. And we know the GenAI revolution is real, and we're doubling down. What you're seeing our investments are very focused on building the best software in the world, and selling the best software in the world. So we have great leadership on both the engineering side and the go-to-market side and we're going to have more clarity of focus in the way we drive the go-to-market. \n Now we're getting to size and scale the calls for that. So there are various motions to market that will have single line of sight accountability and responsibility for a number and the accountability can't be stressed highly enough because we need leaders that can run businesses here. And that's what really big leaders want to do anyway. And Gina rightfully pointed out, we don't do anything without the margin in mind. So we have a pipeline. We manage the whole company on something we call the CEO of Dashboard. We are in real time with a rolling 4-quarter average pipe. We have our GenAI use cases that are against that pipe based on the stage of the sales cycle. \n So we know how many we can afford to hire based on probability of closure within 1% to 2%, and that is how we drive the financial performance of the company and how many people we let in the door. I do want to stress because we run a clean platform here and we run a GenAI company here. That's our absolute commitment. \n We are going to run a super efficient company. So on the G&A side of the equation, we continue to be lean and as we get bigger as a percent of revenue, that will drop even further. So I think you're going to like that. And I think a lot of companies now are showing up here at our doorstep, they want to see the Now on Now story because they're like, how is it that you could have one financial system for thousands and thousands and one HR system and one CRM system, when my company has hundreds and I can't even keep track of them all. And I think a lot of what I'm trying to explain to you is we're in the beginning stages of the end of one era and the beginning of another. By the way, Samad, when you show up, you'll notice that it will be a stunning knowledge, and you'll see thousands more people than you saw last year. We just keep getting bigger and bigger. So get ready for the best Vegas show you've ever seen. And Derrick, I would just give you one thing to think about, too. You could take great companies like Novartis, who want to be a global leader in their industry. And that industry has been held back with 6.5-year clinical trials. And these kinds of CEOs are rethinking everything and they're using generative AI as the gateway to change. And they're looking at not only GenAI, but they're also looking at ServiceNow as a fresh new platform design to take on some of the tougher process challenges that has slowed companies down. And as CJ said, which I think is a major point, the time to implementation on these GenAI use cases has been faster than anything I've seen, not just against Pro, but against anything. \n They want it in now. So there's an urgency and that urgency is coming from the C-suite, and it's a movement. And I've never seen a desire for implementation speed like I have for GenAI. And that, to me, is a big factor as you navigate and the way you think about this business, this business model and GenAI is a category, who's going to win, who's going to lose and which customers really want the solution, how quickly do they want the solution if they see the value they want it yesterday, and that's a great sign for us."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Chirantan Desai",
            "content": "So I would say, Karl, I would start first is environment, and we shared this in January, Bill, Gina and I, it remains pretty much the same from our perspective as it -- and what we mean by that, it is not 2021, specifically. So it still takes many approvals and all the things that we discussed from a sales perspective in trying to get business validation done or a purchase being made. And pretty much, I would say, that's a standard across industries and geographies. \n We are absolutely executing well within that environment given our promise of efficiency and automation so that is absolutely resonating and combine that with our in-platform generative AI, which also resonates really well because that is an accelerant to the productivity enhancements that an organization can take. \n So whether it's Wall Street banks, whether it's a life sciences corporation, whether it's governments, that story of automation, digital, productivity, enhance via GenAI is absolutely resonating and that is what is helping us, despite the environment continuing to be the same. This is CJ. And here is where I would say that specifically, we absolutely believe, and we have seen it that GenAI is helping our software engineers code faster. I mean, straight up. It helps us our software engineers code faster, whether they are junior software engineers or very senior software engineers, they still can leverage and continue to leverage generative AI. So I'll start with that, that is increasing our engineering productivity and it varies depending on how senior the engineer is or how junior the engineer is. And number two, it helps us increase our innovation velocity. So that is really, really important to us that it increases our innovation velocity. \n When I flip that for our customers is that when customers leverage ServiceNow generative AI, and if they can do automation faster, whether he's using text to code or text to workflow types of use cases that they can not only increase the number of workflows that they put on ServiceNow, but second, it also increases that digital efficiency. So it's both ways. Our engineers are able to innovate faster and then our customers are able to workflow faster because of generative AI. Yes. And the only thing I would add there is every single workflow continues to still grow double digits plus, plus. So we have no, hey, this has been taken out of x or this been taken out of y besides Gina individually calling out all our growth vectors, whether it's our core, which is ITSM and ITOM or whether it's our growth, which our CSM and other products, AppEngine, part of creator and customer, all of them continue to grow very nicely, and they grew very nicely in Q1. So first, I'll use, Tyler, one quick example that I was in a conversation at a bank, very technical audience in their technology organization. They were still on ITSM Standard. Once they saw what we have done with Pro plus, they actually bought Pro and Pro Plus together. And that is just amazing that they bought both technologies together, not just saying, \"hey, I'm going to go to Pro and then staircase to Pro Plus.\" That's a very specific example. But the way we look at this specific product line, whether it's ITSM or whether it's CSM, our customer service, is I look at both Pro and Enterprise in total. \n So when I look at Pro and Enterprise in total, so I'm excluding Pro Plus on purpose here, so Pro and Enterprise, which are the bigger SKUs at a higher priced amount, they grew nicely for ITSM, for CSM, for our HR Service Delivery. Three of our anchor businesses, when you combine Pro and Enterprise, that is still a high-growth business and then you add Pro Plus, that's what allows us, at this scale of $2.52 billion to grow at 24.5%. I would say it is extremely important, Patrick, is the simple answer. Here are the three things we are solving for with our own LLMs. First of all, they are use case specific. And ServiceNow has many use cases that are used by our customers, whether it's IT service management, customer service, our ITOM, all of our key product lines. These are use case specific. And sometimes you would say, even for what Bill talked about agent summarization and other things or text to code, we always want use case-specific LLMs. \n So then the question is why. One, the accuracy is higher; number two, these are smaller models which are efficient to run, as you have seen, our gross margin guidance that Gina provided that we feel comfortable with the cost to run these models because when the models are smaller, the cost to run them is not high; and number three, from an end user perspective, a smaller model always performs better. So I consider this as a unique strategy that we are fortunate to have a great AI teams at ServiceNow, focused on not only the engineering execution, but combine that with research and experience on how our customers will consume Pro Plus, these things matter. And that's why domain-specific SLMs, small language models, is the right strategy for ServiceNow. We can run it in our cloud, customers' data is protected, and they have higher throughput and get higher value. Alex, great to hear from you. So I'll take this on. So there are a couple of things we are seeing. So when we launched Pro in 2018 September, and we launched Pro Plus in 2023 September. As Bill outlined in his comments, the Pro Plus uptake by our customers is at a higher pace than Pro uptake was across not only just ITSM, but also CSM and also HR, which are 3 big product lines for ServiceNow. So when you look at exactly 2 quarters and 2 days that we have been in the market, it has exceeded our internal projections on what Pro Plus will do and our ability to sell them. And as Gina outlined, that not only it was in the 7 out of 10 deals, which are the top deals for ServiceNow in Q1, we had $7 million-plus deals, including public sector deals in a regulated environment where our engineers have made the technology work for this regulated environment. \n So overall, when I see what is happening on the demand environment, it is at a higher pace given very clear metrics around productivity for whether it's IT agents, customer service agents, HR staff, or for the employees. And that's what is driving the demand because it accelerates the productivity or multiplies it however you want to call it. \n The second thing I would say is when I look out Q2, Q3, Q4, I still see significant interest from customers, and they are saying, okay, CJ, what's going on with the customers who purchased this in, say, for example, Q4. Now here is a really positive news that I do want to report, and we will share more details at our Financial Analyst Day, Alex, is that customers are, for the first time very eager to turn on Pro Plus and want to see and work with us on where the productivity improvements they are seeing and say, help us understand, I saw that when a call got transferred from one IT agent to the other IT agent on follow-the-sun model, the quick summarization help them significantly, so they didn't ask the end user same question. So there are a lot of nuances we are learning as we work with our customers, but they are deploying. And when I say deploying, as in implementing Pro Plus at a much faster rate than Pro, which is allowing us and our sales team to use this as an example, while convincing other customers to sell. \n So overall, not only the demand environment I'm seeing is better for Pro Plus than Pro, if you ask me the same question in 2019 April, which was 5 years ago. But I'm also seeing that customers are turning on Pro Plus and working with us saying, here is where I'm seeing the improvement. Here is how I should think about it. And our engineering teams are doing a phenomenal job releasing improvements literally on a monthly basis to make sure that our customers are successful with Pro Plus. So first of all, thanks for the question, Derrick. Here is how I would describe it. Our design goals and engineering goals were, this has to be super simple to turn it on, as in Pro Plus, once you are on Pro, and you can start using our Pro Plus capabilities, whether it's for agents, employees and so on. That has been our design principle. The setup is super simple, and customers are turning it on and seeing where they are seeing improvements on productivity, whether it's for agents or employees. So that's number one. \n Number two, I absolutely do not expect that this requires a heavy system integrator types of implementation that is drawn out in the old machine learning technologies, where you create a model, refine a model and you need data scientists, machine learning engineers and so on. This is pretty straightforward for ServiceNow use cases. Where system integrators can help is what Bill talked about that, hey, is there a new way to look at this process? And should I even put in another process on ServiceNow platform because I can see this is just super fast to get value out of ServiceNow. \n So in terms of implementation cycles, they are actually faster on Pro Plus than they have ever been before. And we don't expect a heavy implementation cost. However, if our customers want to leverage system integrators, the biggest value that they always had is helping them think through what additional generative AI use cases they can use and redefining processes."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Q1 set a strong precedent for the year ahead. Building on the momentum from Q4, our team delivered another exceptional outperformance. We surpassed all of our top line and profitability guidance metrics for the quarter. With GenAI conversations serving as a digital transformation catalyst, we see that momentum carrying into Q2.  \n Turning to our results. In Q1, subscription revenues were $2.523 billion, growing 24.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by approximately 50 basis points. RPO ended the quarter at approximately $17.7 billion, representing 27% year-over-year constant currency growth. We continue to see average contract terms increase year-over-year as the strategic importance of the Now platform has driven longer duration deals. Current RPO was $8.45 billion, representing 21% year-over-year constant currency growth, a 100 basis point beat versus our guidance.  \n From an industry perspective, technology, media and telecom was extremely robust, growing net new ACV over 100% year-over-year. Education had a fantastic quarter, growing nearly 50% year-over-year. Transportation and Logistics, Business and Consumer Services and Retail and Hospitality also saw strength. Our renewal rate was a best-in-class 98% as the Now platform remains a strategic imperative for our customers' operations.   \n We closed 59 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter with 4 deals greater than $10 million, representing 300% year-over-year growth. Our focus on selling a comprehensive platform continue to drive more multiproduct deals as 15 of our top 20 deals included 7 or more products. We now have 1,933 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV. In addition, the number of customers paying us $20 million or more grew over 50% year-over-year. \n In Q1, our GenAI products continue to see very healthy adoption. As Bill mentioned, our Pro Plus net new ACV to date continued the trend ahead of any new product family launched for the comparable period. Our GenAI products were in 7 of our top 10 deals, and we closed 7 deals over $1 million in ACV in the quarter. We had wins at a second Wall Street bank, a leading cybersecurity firm and many more, including a significant win for ITOM Pro Plus, which just launched in March. \n Turning to profitability. Non-GAAP operating margin was over 30%, approximately 150 basis points above our guidance, driven by the timing of marketing spend, OpEx efficiencies and our top line outperformance. Our free cash flow margin was 47%, up 12 points year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a robust balance sheet, including $8.8 billion in cash and investments. In Q1, we bought back 225,000 shares as part of our share repurchase program with the primary objective of managing the impact of dilution. \n As of the end of the quarter, we have approximately $787 million remaining of the original $1.5 billion authorization. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth, profitability and shareholder value. \n Moving to our guidance. In Q1, we initiated a program to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated revenues. The initiative is expected to lessen the impact of recent movements in the euro and pound, but the incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar has still resulted in FX headwinds compared to our previous guidance. Given our Q1 outperformance, we are raising our 2024 top line outlook to more than offset those moves. \n For 2024, we are raising our subscription revenues by $20 million at the midpoint of the range to more than offset an incremental $17 million headwind from FX. This raises a net increase of $3 million on a narrowed range of $10.560 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 21.5% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect subscription gross margin of 84.5%, operating margin of 29% and free cash flow margin of 31%. \n Finally, we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 208 million. For Q2, we expect subscription revenues between $2.525 billion and $2.530 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% year-over-year growth or 22% on a constant currency basis. We expect cRPO growth of 20.5%, both on a reported and constant currency basis. We expect an operating margin of 25%. \n Finally, we expect 208 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter. In summary, Q1 was a great start to what we expect to be another tremendous year. Organizations are under more pressure than ever to maximize the benefits of the technology investments. In this environment, ServiceNow's traction as the intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation continues to intensify. GenAI is only as powerful as the platform it's built on. \n The Now platform gives us deep insights with the remarkable ability to tailor AI outputs to the specific needs of our customers. Business users need AI to power actions across the enterprise. Our workflows are designed to do just that, deliver complete solutions to supercharge experiences, creating extraordinary value. You'll hear more about these experiences, our strategy and long-term opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day on May 6, which will be webcast on our Investor Relations website. \n Finally, before moving on to Q&A, I want to thank all of our employees worldwide for helping make ServiceNow one of the Fortune 100 Best Places to Work yet again in 2024. ServiceNow's greatest asset is its people, and you all continue to make us, ServiceNow strong. Bill and I couldn't be prouder of this incredible team. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Yes. And Kash, on your question around seasonality about the cRPO. So first and foremost, really proud of the fact that we beat our guide in Q1 by 100 basis points. That beat was twofold: one, strong net new ACV growth as well as higher early renewals. And so from a seasonality perspective you'll remember, we talked about the Fed duration. And so Q2 is slightly more impacted, right, before it pops up again in Q3. And so we feel really good about the trends that we're seeing. And again, feel really good. We continue to be prudent in our guide around early renewals, while we are seeing them stronger than we saw last year. Again, from a guidance perspective and a forecast perspective, we're continuing to be prudent there. Yes. Matt, I'll take that one. So yes, we are absolutely seeing faster Pro Plus adoption versus Pro. It's 2 quarters out, right? So it's early days, but we feel really good about the adoption curve. And we've been talking about whether or not that adoption curve would be faster. And we posited that it would be, and that's certainly proving out to be the case, although again, early days. \n With respect to discounting versus initial expectations, we feel really good about the realized pricing and it has been very much in line with our initial expectations. And we'll talk a lot more as you would expect at Investor Day about the overall GenAI opportunity for ServiceNow as well as where we are to date. But we feel very good about what we're seeing in the markets. Customers are really leaning in. We talked about 7 deals in the top 10 had GenAI in it, significant deals over $1 million as well. So we're definitely seeing monetization happening already. Yes, it's a great point, and I did call that out. So RPO growth was 27% year-over-year in constant currency, which is 300 basis points improvement versus last year. And yes, that is our longer-term backlog. So as you think more longer term about the opportunity in ServiceNow, I couldn't be more excited about that. We are seeing the average duration growing. And in fact, duration this Q1 is the largest it's been in the Q1 since, I think, 2019. And so I feel really good about what that means for the mid- and long-term opportunity here for sure. Yes. And I would just add -- I think I would just add, we are absolutely customer 0, 100% on all of our GenAI use cases. Deflection rates have doubled for both our employees and customers and they're improving every month. Right? It's really early days. So it's learning faster and faster. Software engineers are accepting 48% of text to code generation. So there's absolutely the ability to see leverage in our R&D as we look to the mid- and long term. So thank you for the question. Yes. So we'll definitely give you a lot more details on all things GenAI at Investor Day, and that's in a week and a bit. So stay tuned there. Yes, the adoption curve is stronger than we've seen in any new product category launch, but that's starting from 0, right? So it's a small dollar at this point in time, but the speed at which it's going to grow to be a really meaningful contributor is faster than anything we've seen. \n And so what I'd say is that 24.5% revenue growth at the scale at which we are, the larger numbers is pretty incredible. And we see continued traction across the board, whether it's our technology workflows, our customer workflows or our creator as well. And so really across the board, employees had a really strong quarter, customer had a really strong quarter. ITSM core remains healthy in 16 of our top 20 deals, 10 deals over $1 million. ITOM was included also in 16 of the top 20 deals with 9 deals over $1 million, security and risk in totality, still doing well. And so it's the great thing about having a platform with the breadth that ServiceNow has, that we continue to drive really, really good growth at our scale across the platform. Brad, thanks so much for the question. So we're really excited about the investment in Saudi. And rest assured, that $500 million is a long-term investment over a long horizon period. It will be in -- most of that investment is in data center, so it will be in cost of sales, but you'll -- again, we manage our margin very tightly. And the growth that we're from that investment is huge. The opportunity that we see in Riyadh and Saudi, NEOM, is great. And Bill spent a nice time there at the LEAP conference, and we're really excited about really pulling our technology to really help that society grow and become a digital-first economy. \n And they're leaning in very heavy with ServiceNow, are really excited about our product portfolio, not only our GenAI, but really the breadth of the entirety of the portfolio. So it will be within our CapEx guide that you have always seen, it's not on top of, and we're just really excited about planning flags more in the Middle East. And I would just add to that, Samad. I would just add that last year, might have looked like we slowed down sales and marketing, but there's a lot in that number, and we talked about this, a lot of operations, sales ops. And we actually were very focused even last year on continuing to hire quota-bearing feet on the street sales folks. We're entering -- we entered 2024 with the higher -- the highest increase in ramp reps that we have in a while. \n So yes, we will be reaccelerating. We feel really good about pipe. We feel really good about demand. And so -- but I want to make clear that we didn't stop hiring salespeople feet on the street. Last year, we continue to hire and we will continue to do that because our pipe looks strong and demand looks great. Yes. So if you remember, Samad, last year, we've been -- over the last year, we've been more prudent in how we've been forecasting early renewals because it's hard to forecast. It's very customer specific and customer by customer. And so in Q1, our beat was really strong on our net new ACV growth, but we also saw early renewals than our prudent forecast. I haven't changed how we're thinking about forecasting. I'm still remaining prudent given the macro. And so as we think about seasonality. I talked about Q2 being lower, slightly lower, but then it bounced back up in Q3 when Fed is our strong quarter. And so again, it wasn't material enough to impact the Q2 guidance, but I'm not assuming better early renewals in Q2 like we saw in Q1. Absolutely, John. Thanks for the question. I didn't mention it because we had such great results in so many other industries and sectors. But our federal business also was strong and had its biggest Q1 ever with $8 million plus deals and net new ACV growth that accelerated. And so we hosted our largest Fed forum ever with customers representing more than $1 billion in ACV and triple the number of attendees at our executive circle and over 35 partner sponsorships and so really strong federal business. And actually, our GenAI offerings are reinforcing our ability to help accelerate the transformation journey for our federal customers. And so we're seeing early adopters and healthy industry -- sorry, healthy interest in our domain specific models, which offer better security that CJ just talked about and really can drive tremendous efficiency gains. And so exciting themes ahead for 2024 and feel really good about what the federal business will continue to do for us as well as public sector as a whole. So thanks so much for the question. Yes. Thanks, Michael, for noticing. We're really proud of the 47% free cash flow margin. Year-over-year, though, you have to remember that Q1 of last year was lower than normal given the Silicon Valley Bank and regional bank crisis that happened that quarter. All of that being said, even if you normalize for that, we are significantly higher. And that's testament to the strong margin, operating margin and some nice work that we've been doing on working capital efficiencies. And so we feel really good. Seasonality for free cash flow will be similar to what you've seen historically. And so just really strong results. The team has done an outstanding job on working capital efficiencies, and we'll continue to see that as well."
