During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2021.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Ashley and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Tim. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note. Results were ahead of expectations and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021. During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared to prior year. And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equals the prior third quarter with particularly strong renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4. Average physical occupancy also remains strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from the performance in Q3. We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for a continued outperformance into the coming spring and summer leasing season. Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamental across the Sunbelt over the next three years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022. I believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly, strong position as we head into the recovery part of the cycle.\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through the fourth quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter. In addition to the improvement in occupancy, we\u2019re able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter in line with the third quarter at an 80 basis point increase. All in place rents are effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved 1.3% for the fourth quarter. As noted in the release collections during the quarter, we\u2019re strong. We collected 99.2% of build rent in the fourth quarter. This is the same result we have in the third quarter of 2020. We\u2019ve worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The numbers of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 491 for the January rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. We saw a steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we made progress on our interior unit redevelopment program, as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controls, lights, thermostat, and security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2020, we installed 23,950 Smart Home packages and completed just over 4,200 interior unit upgrades. January\u2019s collections are in line with the good results we saw in the fourth quarter as of January 31, we\u2019ve collected 98.7% of rent build, which is comparable to the month end number for the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Leasing volume in January was strong, up 4.9% from last year. Blended lease-over-lease rent growth effective during January exceeded last year\u2019s results for the first time since March. Effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for January was positive 2.2%, a 40 basis improvement from the prior year. Effective new lease pricing for January was negative 1.8%. This is a 70 basis point improvement from January of last year. January renewals effective during the month were up 6.3%. Our customer service scores improved to 110 basis points over the prior year. This aids to our retention trends, which are positive for January, February and March, as well as lease-over-lease renewal rates for those months, which are in the 5.5% to 6.5% range.\nBrad Hill: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. While most buyers have returned to the market, the lack of available for sell properties continues to restrict transaction volume. investor demand for multi-family product within our region of the country is very strong and this supply demand imbalance is driving aggressive pricing. due to the robust demand supported by continued low interest rates, cap rates have compressed further and are frequently in the high 3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. we expect to remain active in the transaction market this year, but based on pricing levels, we\u2019re currently seeing, we\u2019re not optimistic that we will succeed in finding existing communities that will clear our underwriting hurdles in 2021. While acquiring will be a challenge as noted in the earnings guidance, we do plan to come to market with $200 million to $250 million of planned property dispositions this year. we will redeploy those proceeds into our growing development pipeline, which currently stands at $595 million with eight projects and just over 2,600 units. In the fourth quarter, we started construction on the MAA Windmill Hill in Austin, Texas, as well as Novel Val Vista, a pre-purchase in Phoenix, Arizona. both of these are lower density suburban projects that we expect to deliver stabilized NOI yields around 6%, well in excess of our current acquisition cap rates. despite increased construction costs as well as some supply chain issues related specifically to cabinets and appliances, our development and pre-purchase projects remain on budget with no significant delay concerns at this point. We have several other development sites owned or under contract that we hope to start construction on in 2021 and into 2022. we are encouraged that despite facing some supply pressure. our phase 2 lease-up property located in Fort worth continues to lease up at our original expectations, as does our soon to be completed Phase 2 in Dallas, we\u2019re over 90% of the units have been delivered.\nAl Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad and good morning. core FFO of $1.65 per share for the fourth quarter produced full year core FFO of $6.43 per share, which represented a 2.7% growth over the prior year and as well above our internal expectations following the breakout of the pandemic. stable occupancy, strong collections and positive pricing performance were the primary drivers of continued same-store revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which was 1.8%. And for the full year, which is 2.5%. As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk internet program, which is included in utilities expenses. And now, some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating expenses to begin moderating this year, which I\u2019ll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth quarter, but we continue to fund development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs. As Brad mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to eight deals with total projected costs of $595 million.\nOperator:  We\u2019ll take our first question from Sumit Sharma with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nSumit Sharma: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you for providing all the color on the stats in Q4. I guess to kick things off in terms of the SS rev growth this year, I know you mentioned that Tampa and Phoenix were one of your stronger markets. So, just wondering as you looked at 2020, Phoenix was the strongest performer, Orlando was the weakest. the spread in SS revs was 630 bps. In Q4, that changed, Tampa was better and Orlando was the weakest. So, I guess what\u2019s that spread look like in the context of your 2021 guidance of 1% to 3%. And where do you see the most meaningful change in performance? In terms of things you already know about?\nTom Grimes: Yes, I\u2019ll start with that one. And I\u2019ll let Tim or Al wrapped up on the forecast. What I would tell you is, as I mentioned in the call, the thing that is most different for us in 2021 is the shift in the swing in jobs bringing from negative 6.4 to positive 3.4, and that\u2019s going to be the thing that drives us in that moves \u2013 that moves across the markets. We see that at the high end, where we\u2019ll continue to see markets like Tampa and Raleigh, and Phoenix and Jacksonville accelerate. but we\u2019ll also see it in places like Orlando in Houston and D.C., which are weaker now, but they will begin to improve as job growth comes to play in those markets.\nAl Campbell: Yes, just looking for the future in our \u2013 what we have in our forecast, the 2% overall. I mean, I think you just think about the markets and some of the markets that we\u2019re thinking would be the strongest as Tom talked about and mentioned Phoenix, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, some of the ones that are going to be okay. markets that are going to be reasonable, it\u2019s still challenging Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, and then some of the more challenging markets, Houston, Orlando and D.C. And I think all of those together and basically, the pricing trends we see right now and expect for the year, given the job growth comes the 2% expectation.\nSumit Sharma: All right, got it. Thank you so much for the color. One more if you will indulge me on supply, now you talked about 2021 supply being 25% \u2013 priced 25% higher and centered in urban and downtown market or submarket. I guess we \u2013 the permit levels are less than at low levels in pre-COVID levels, but they are increasing as we\u2019ve heard from other market participants as well. So, keeping that in mind, do you have any insights to share on what types of markets or products or price points that are being emphasized by the new permit? So, not the 21 deliveries, but what\u2019s being started right now at a more garden style, more urban, less urban, any color on that?\nBrad Hill: Yes. this is Brad. I would say that just giving the economics of what we\u2019re seeing today, it\u2019s really hard to underwrite more urban high density product. So, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that a higher percent of the product that\u2019s being developed today is more suburban in nature. But I\u2019d say having said that, when we look at the spread between the rents of new supply, that\u2019s coming online versus our properties, that spread is still really good and as Eric said that, that\u2019s leading to more redevelopment opportunities for us. So, we think that that continues. It\u2019s hard to say where just looking at permitting trends while they\u2019re clearly down versus pre-COVID levels, I would say construction starts are down even more. It\u2019s hard to say just from the permitting data, where that supply is located. but my sense is that it\u2019s going to be more suburban in nature. but given the economics of where costs are the rent levels of those are still going to be pretty substantial compared to our current product.\nEric Bolton: This is Eric, Sumit, I\u2019ll add to what Brad is saying. I agree, based on everything that I\u2019ve seen that it does \u2013 it would appear that the majority of a lot of the \u2013 this permitting activity is oriented more suburban in nature. But having said that, one of the things that we\u2019re really starting to see more evidence of is frankly entitlement and permitting is getting more challenging as more of this multihousing product heads to the suburbs. We\u2019re seeing a lot of \u2013 particularly, in the satellite cities, the suburban cities, if you will, that have their own school systems and their own municipal governments, they are becoming very restrictive about what they are allowing the way of apartment permitting believing that these additional households will put some level of stress on the infrastructure and we\u2019re seeing that the permitting activity is starting to get a lot more restrictive than it ever has been in a lot of these Southeastern markets. So, I think there\u2019s another if you will, a hurdle starting to develop across some of these Southeast markets that will make it increasingly a little bit more challenging to supply some of these suburban locations.\nSumit Sharma: Thank you so much for the color. I\u2019ll use my time. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.\nNeil Malkin: Hey everyone. Good morning.\nEric Bolton: Good morning.\nNeil Malkin: So, this is the first time, I think that you guys have really called or Eric, your comments have called out the in-migration. Can you maybe, talk to that, what you\u2019ve seen over the recent months in terms of that sort of out-migration from the coast just given the confluence of bad factors that the coasts are facing, which has been exacerbated by the COVID and work from home. I think last quarter you laid out some statistics about like, what percentage of your new leases were from out of state. If you could just update us on that and any incremental commentary from the property level managers would be great to hear. Thank you.\nTom Grimes: Yes, Neil. it\u2019s Tom. I\u2019ll jump in on that one, if that\u2019s all right. Move-ins from people moving into our footprint from outside of our footprint was 12.2% of total move-ins in fourth quarter. that\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve seen and reflects the steady upward trend that we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years. It was \u2013 for context, it was 9.2% in Q1 of 2019. So, almost a 300 basis point increase, we\u2019ve seen that steadily happening from 2019 on, just to give you a little bit more color on the Q4 move-ins, New York move-ins, move-ins from New York state were up 36%. And apartment searches \u2013 we pull some information from Google, apartment searches in Atlanta were up 60% in New York city, move-ins from Massachusetts were up 43% and apartments in Raleigh searches were up 68% in Boston. And trends go on from there. The other notable is probably California, which is up 60% and apartments in Austin searches were up 90% in Los Angeles.\nEric Bolton: And Neil, this is Eric. just to add on to some of that detail that Tom laid out there. I do think that there are a lot of reasons to believe that a lot of this migration trend that we saw the U.S. population to the Southeast over the past year as I mentioned in my comments earlier, a lot of these trends were evident prior to COVID. COVID accelerated those trends somewhat. And I would tell you that I believe a lot of this \u2013 a lot of the moves that took place during 2020 are pretty sticky in nature. And I think that the trends are likely to continue post-COVID. I think you have to recognize a lot of these Southeastern markets. They continue to offer all the same attractive qualities that I think started the trend some years back and what is happening as more employers are bringing more knowledge-based jobs and tech jobs into this region of country. The employment base is really starting to further diversify and of course, work from home and these knowledge-based jobs allows a lot more remote working, which I think is also working in our favor. And so I think that a combination of just how these economic trends have been building, frankly, and these jobs in migration trends have been building for the last 10 years or so recognizing celebrate a little bit last year. but those trends were in place well before COVID, and I think we\u2019ll continue past COVID. the affordability of the region, particularly as it relates to housing continues to \u2013 I think be very, very attractive. It will become even more so over the next 10 years. And I think we also have to recognize that these Sunbelt markets are continuing to become very desirable places to live and what Nashville and what Austin, and what Raleigh have to offer people today, versus where they were 20 years ago is night and day difference. And so I\u2019m very optimistic that we are at the beginning of some continued very favorable trends for housing needs throughout this region of the country.\nNeil Malkin: Thank you, all. Eric, so I guess what you\u2019re saying is you think it would be \u2013 it will take longer, or it may not happen for the people, who\u2019ve moved here, areas to make the trek back to the coastal urban city.\nEric Bolton: Yes. I think the idea that once the vaccine is in place and if you will, society returns to normal. the idea that there\u2019s going to be this giant reversal, our population shifts back to the gateway markets. I think that\u2019s a ridiculous argument. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. Those trends were in place to the Southeast and Sunbelt markets before COVID. COVID accelerated a little bit and I think those trends are going to be and we learned a lot last year, and employers learned a lot in and households learned a lot. And I think the attractiveness of this region is only \u2013 is better understood today than it ever has been and I think these trends are going to continue.\nNeil Malkin: That\u2019s great. The other one for me, the single-family market has been very strong. You have new and existing home sales and mortgage applications at multiyear highs. I\u2019m just wondering, and obviously, you guys are theoretically more exposed to that sort of risk, just given the relative affordability. Have you seen any uptick in move-out for home purchases or home rentals, or anything like that that would give you some reticence, just in terms of potential demand erosion, let\u2019s say over the next 12 months?\nTom Grimes: Hey, Neil, it\u2019s Tom. I mean, nothing \u2013 I mean, zero reticence I would say, we\u2019re quite pleased with the way the market conditions are going at this point. In the fourth quarter, home buying this time was up slightly by like three percentage points is a move-out reason or about 200 move-outs on total. So, I mean, we saw a little bit there. but as you look forward, our accept rates are at their normal level. So, we\u2019re not seeing any turnover go up over time there. And home renting is a flat again, so that continues not to be a major factor. We agree with you that the overall, home buying market certainly getting stronger and we wouldn\u2019t surprise to see that tick up from time to time, but it is \u2013 it\u2019s really reflective of a strong jobs market and a good economy, and that produces jobs and frankly, jobs are the thing that drive our business. So, it would be my thought thus far.\nNeil Malkin: All right. Thank you guys for the time and love the Sunbelt.\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Neil. We do too.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bilerman: It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. So, I had a question and Nick had another one as well, Eric, as you think about \u2013 I know how positive you are on the current markets in the Sunbelt and all the trends that have been accelerated away from the gateway market. You inherited D.C. when you thought a post, I don\u2019t know if it was a gift with purchase or whatever, but you got some exposure to some coastal exposure in the Northeast. What would make you come in and want to buy or developed any gateway markets, I guess, at what point does the risk reward, what needs to happen a) from a diversification standpoint? Is it trends? Is it relative values, growth profiles? I guess, where is your mindset about that today? because if everyone is zigging, maybe, you want to zag and maybe, there would be a good opportunity from a value perspective there.\nEric Bolton: Well, Michael, I would tell you that my principles and sort of the philosophy that I\u2019ve always had in terms of how we think about deploying capital is really continues to be grounded in the overriding belief that the most important thing that we\u2019re charged with doing is deploying capital in a manner to create the highest recurring quality revenue stream and earnings stream that we can to pay a steady growing dividend throughout the cycle. And if you will and creating a optimized, sort of full cycle performance profile. at end of the day, I think re-shareholder capital over time \u2013 over a long period of time is largely rewarded through steady earnings growth, obviously and particularly, dividend growth. And having said that, I\u2019ve always believed then that the best way to accomplish that performance objective in that profile is deploy capital, where demand is likely to be the best and the strongest and growing in a consistent fashion over a long period of time. I get it that the Southeast markets for years, the argument and the criticism was that there lower barriers to supply and new supply can come in, and oversupply and market. What I would tell you is, what supply causes is it causes moderation. What demand causes is steady earnings growth over time and on a falloff in demand can have catastrophic consequences and an oversupplied market is unlikely to be catastrophic in nature. It can be weak for a year or two, but it\u2019s unlikely to trigger a massive sort of upsets your earnings stream, which can put a company in trouble, create dividend stress or things of that nature. So, I\u2019ve always believed that these Sunbelt markets offer the performance profile that we\u2019re after and that\u2019s what we should be doing and where we should focus our capital. So, it\u2019s a very long answer to your question, but no \u2013 we have no interest in now using this opportunity to go into these gateway markets. I don\u2019t think our \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to do for capital for shareholder capital would not be sufficiently rewarded for pursuing that. At this point, we don\u2019t see a reason to do that and we like what we\u2019re doing.\nMichael Bilerman: How do you think about just the risk reward from a return perspective, right? I think you\u2019re extraordinarily fortunate to be so heavy in these markets having built the platform that you\u2019ve done through a lot of hard work in acquisitions and M&A and development. But there\u2019s a lot of capital chasing these markets too, right, which is going to drive down returns overall and I\u2019m not ignoring the fact that the demand is extraordinarily strong. but is there a financial side of it too that as money\u2019s coming out of these gateways, that you could create a better total return by deploying capital or reallocating capital in the portfolio, or is that just not \u2013 in your view, the demand is not there. so, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if I can get 100 basis points or 200 basis points higher initial return out of it.\nEric Bolton: No. I get your point. And I mean, obviously, I think it depends somewhat on your investment horizon as you think about risk return or risk reward return. I think, clearly, there\u2019s going to be opportunities that are going to emerge in some of these gateway markets, where you can go in and deploy capital and make an investment and create an exceptional return on your investment. I think it somewhat depends on your horizon and how long, you want to think about the capital being deployed in that market. Again, from our perspective, we\u2019re very long-term investors, very long-term holders, and we\u2019re trying to create an earnings profile from that investment action to match up well, in terms of how we\u2019re trying to perform for capital over a long period of time. And so we just don\u2019t believe that with that horizon that we\u2019re working with and that objective that we\u2019re shooting for, that the gateway markets really aligned for us in the way we want to try to perform for capital. I\u2019m not suggesting that focusing on those markets is wrong. And I think there are certainly ways to make a lot of money in those markets. But I think, you have to think about your horizon perhaps a little bit differently. And I will say that while we continue to see capital coming into these markets, I think that there are times, where these gateway markets over the last and this over the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, just attracting enormous amount of capital and a lot of international capital sometimes that I think, was really motivated by now semester of looking for a great return on their capital in some cases is looking for a place to preserve capital if you will. And so you get a lot of different influences with some of these bigger gateway markets and particularly, with international capital that can, I think, create some distortions from time to time, in terms of assets are being priced relative to the long-term earnings potential of the investment. So, we just see volatility and other aspects of those markets that \u2013 those gateway markets that just don\u2019t really match up well to how we\u2019re trying to perform for capital. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on it the way we do.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Appreciate that. And this is Nick, just one other question on guidance. The first quarter range is pretty wide. Obviously, we\u2019re a month into the quarter, and there are fewer leases that are signed. I recognize still the uncertainty, but just wondering if you can walk through how you could end up at the high end or the low end, and then specific to your same-store revenue comment, where you expect same-store revenue to be in the first quarter. I know you said it should be the lowest point of the year.\nAl Campbell: Yes. Nick, this is Al. I think \u2013 and just overall, I mean, just given the uncertainty that\u2019s in the marketplace, I think that the first quarter being the first quarter of the year and where you have the most uncertainty, I think the range was just to reflect that. And I think the driver for the forecast for the whole year is based on revenue performance and so I think that\u2019s the key to be the top or the bottom of the range and really, for the year or for the quarters. And I think the first quarter, as talked about a little bit in the comments is expected to be the lowest revenue quarter for the year, but that\u2019s really reflecting effective rent per unit, which is a combination, which is a backward or a trailing indicator, which is combination of the pricing you did last year, plus what you\u2019re doing this year. And so we\u2019re expecting improving pricing trends, but the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter, because it will reflect really, the bulk of last year\u2019s pricing, which was 1.3% on average and we certainly expect that to be higher in 2021 based on the forecast we\u2019re pleading together. So that\u2019s really the key factors. Hope that answers your question.\nNick Joseph: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Tom, there was nearly an 800 basis point delta between the new lease rate and the renewals. How sustainable is that type of spread and given the pricing\u2019s out there on the internet, why aren\u2019t residents pushing you guys harder on renewals?\nTom Grimes: The spread is always going to be kind of the widest at this time of the year, because new lease pricing is at its most challenged, but the \u2013 that delta and that delta will close over time. but that gap will always be there. And the \u2013 really, the variation is with a new renter, they have a level of leverage, because they\u2019re shopping and they can move anywhere and their switching costs are really the same. if we have done our job and provided good resident service and taking care of the residents and frankly, a pretty challenging time. We\u2019ve earned the opportunity, because we\u2019ve created for value to charge a little bit more. And so that is where we have the most pricing power, because we\u2019ve worked with them, we\u2019ve earned them and their switching costs are a little bit higher. So that delta that you talked about has always been there. It is widest in this time of year and it will be tightest in the summer months, but we expect that and we plan for that and we ask our residents for a little more to reflect the value that we\u2019ve created for them.\nRob Stevenson: And implied in the guidance for the year, I mean, where are you guys thinking that new lease versus renewals winds up coming in? we\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s more or less flat on new leases are still negative there and how significant should the \u2013 or is the guidance anticipating renewals be?\nTim Argo: Rob, this is Tim. I think what we would expect overall is that new lease pricing probably slightly negative. It\u2019ll \u2013 it\u2019s very seasonal as Tom mentioned and depends on the \u2013 it\u2019s sort of the leading edge of demand. So, you\u2019ll see pretty negative in Q1, Q4 move to positive as we get into the summer. But I think over the average, probably a little bit negative and then renewal is kind of hanging in there like they have, anywhere in that five to six range and again, burying some with a little bit higher in the summer, a little bit weaker in the fall and winter.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then the other one from me is, you guys did, call it, $424 million of revenues in 2020. How much of that is non-residential, so retail, commercial, other spaces at your properties? And where did that wind-up coming in versus expectations a year ago? I mean, what was the negative delta? how significantly was that impacted over the last year versus what you would have expected this time a year ago?\nEric Bolton: I think the major component that\u2019s outside of residential is really just commercial. It\u2019s only about 1.5% of our revenue stream. So, it\u2019s really minor overall, Rob. And so we we\u2019ve had pretty good performance. I mean, we\u2019ve looked at our tenants and we certainly have some programs to sort of rent, where we need to \u2013 but we had good collection on a lot of our tenants are fair strong, and have strong businesses that have been able to continue paying well. And so it\u2019s \u2013 so collections have been good, so it hasn\u2019t even on a small number. We\u2019ve had pretty good performance still on a relative basis.\nRob Stevenson: And the occupancy there, I mean, are you guys fairly full? Is that sort of, is that half full, I mean, how are you guys sort of characterizing, even though it\u2019s a small percentage given that it\u2019s also amenity space for some of your tenants as well I assume?\nRob DelPriore: Hey, Rob, it\u2019s Rob DelPriore. The \u2013 we\u2019re sitting in about 85% to 90% occupied and we\u2019ve collected about 90% of the revenues and cash on the commercial side.\nRob Stevenson: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing today in terms of construction financing? Have you seen the large money center banks come back to the market at all? And then how has development loan terms changed relative to pre-COVID both in terms of interest rates and then LTVs?\nBrad Hill: Yes, Amanda. this is Brad. I\u2019d say that the construction financing is really kind of a mixed bag. I think it depends on a few things. One the markets that folks are looking in, certainly some markets are easier to get financing in or less hard to get financing in than others. And I think it also depends on the sponsor, I mean, I think what we\u2019re seeing is generally for the larger developers, the strong sponsors that historically, have had a pretty good pipelines. they\u2019re still able to get financing. But I think the smaller developers that do just a handful of deals a year, they\u2019re not as strong. they don\u2019t have as stronger relationship with the banks or having a little bit tougher time getting their debt financing lined up. So that certainly has been an impact in financing. And that also certainly leads to some of our pre-purchase opportunities. in terms of loan terms, we\u2019re seeing, call it, 10-year rates in that 4%, 4.5% range for a construction financing, which I think is still a decent at the moment, really, the only change that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 the biggest change we\u2019ve seen in construction or in financing \u2013 not construction financing, but is really, has to do with the low cap rates that we\u2019re currently seeing for where these stabilized assets, the low cap rates are starting to drive some LTV movement in order for debt service coverage ratios to continue to be held. So, we are seeing loan to values come down a bit. We\u2019re not seeing any impact yet on pricing, but we\u2019ll really just see how that unfolds later this year as more opportunities come to market, but that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re seeing at the moment.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That\u2019s helpful. And then on your comment about that cap rate compression, what\u2019s kind of a reasonable assumption for a cap rate for your targeted disposition this year?\nBrad Hill: I think for our dispositions, given that we\u2019re selling \u2013 we\u2019re selling our Jackson, Mississippi portfolio, which we had on the market last year is 30-year-old, 35-year-old product in a tertiary market. You\u2019re talking 5 to 5.5 cap rate for what we\u2019ll look to sell this year. We\u2019re looking to sell properties that really don\u2019t wind up as well with our overall growth strategy. It\u2019s going to tend to be older property in some of these smaller markets initially, where really, the \u2013 after CapEx; cash flows are really not what we\u2019re looking for. And then the long-term growth is obviously, not what we\u2019re looking for as well. but on a historical basis, the cap rates for these properties are still really, really good at the moment, but I\u2019d say, 5 to 5.5.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay. That makes sense. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. please go ahead.\nAlex Kalmus: All right. Thank you for taking my question. Quick one on stimulus checks, given your market backdrop, the stimulus one-time payments will likely go further for your residents than compared to the urban environments. So well, is there a limited historical fact in, how do you think these will play out in terms of your rent negotiations this year?\nEric Bolton: I wouldn\u2019t think any stimulus check is going to help that situation, but we\u2019re frankly in such a strong position on that with our collection rate where it is, it\u2019ll help close the gap to give us back to last year, and would be welcome, but it would just primarily help a little bit.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you. And just touching upon the recurring CapEx, I noticed year-over-year, there was a little jump there. Can you provide some additional color and which will be increased?\nAl Campbell: I think recurring CapEx can be \u2013 it can be the timing of certain jobs, whether it\u2019s some of the significant jobs like paint jobs, and some of the things of that nature. I think over time, we expect for what we put recurring and revenue enhancing together, and we\u2019d expect to spend call it 1,100 per unit to 1,200 per unit those two together in 2021, which is fairly significant to what 2020 was, but somewhere in that field for the long-term.\nTom Grimes: Yes. And I would add, we had a little bit bigger jump from 2019 to 2020 in recurring CapEx, but for 2021, we\u2019re projecting a very modest increase in terms of recurring CapEx.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On your prepared remarks, you mentioned blended lease growth rate was 2.2% in January. You expect improving pricing trends this year, but then effective rental growth of 1.7% for the year; assuming that these are apples-to-apples numbers are pretty close to it. Why would that effective rent growth for the year be higher?\nAl Campbell: Well, John, this is Al. The effective rent growth talk \u2013 we\u2019ve talked a moment ago about that a bit. I think that\u2019s more of a trailing indicator. It\u2019s a combination of all the leases you have in place right now. And so the pricing performance we had for 2020 was 1.3% on average. And so while projecting for 2020 is certainly higher than that. I think you could do the math, but this is a rough approach, but it\u2019s been a pretty easy way to look at it is take half of what we did in 2020 and half of what we expect to do in 2021, and that\u2019ll drive your effective rent growth of 1.7%. So, you can do the math on that back into we\u2019re expecting something in the 2% to 2.5% range on pricing in the first quarter was, I mean, the January was a good indication toward that.\nEric Bolton: Taking away Al just said, if you take half your lease-over-lease performance \u2013 blended lease-over-lease performance for 2020 and half of your blended lease-over-lease performance for 2021 collected are together that comprises what your effective will be for the year.\nAl Campbell: And that\u2019s the back of the envelope way to do it. But I think if you do that, given that we have at leases an average of a year that works out pretty close and you can get to where we are in our forecast.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Your redevelopment pipeline sits up 15% sequentially this quarter. Can you just remind us how long you think it\u2019ll take to complete the 10,000 units to 15,000 units of redevelopment?\nTom Grimes: In terms of the pipeline going forward, we\u2019ll do over 5,000 units and 2021 towards that. But what we found John over time is that as we move forward our product ages another year and new supplies brought into the market. So, I would be surprised if we ever blew through our potential on that, but at this rate, it would be about three years, but I would expect us to see the pipeline grow over time as new properties are added to it as market conditions change, product added \u2013 product is added and product ages.\nEric Bolton: John, just to add to what Tom was saying that, as he mentioned, there\u2019s new product comes into the market, that really what that does is that that expands our opportunity for redevelopment. And historically, at least over the last number of years, where the redevelopment opportunity for us has been \u2013 the best has been in some of our more urban-oriented locations, which is really where the opportunity largely lies in portfolio now, particularly with the legacy post portfolio, but as new supply begins to over the next few years, if it is more oriented towards the suburban locations, that\u2019s actually going to expand our field of opportunity for more extensive redevelopment out in the suburb components of the portfolio. Because obviously, this new product is coming in at a price point that is well above our existing product and with comparable locations and comparable appeal in that regard, we can go in and make these investments with kitchen and bath upgrades and create a very competitive product and still off of the market, the renter market, a slight discount to the newer product and get great returns on capital and get great lease-up success with it. So, we think that this is a real opportunity for us over the next few years and we expect it to stay at the same high level for the next three or four years for sure.\nJohn Kim: Is 19.5% a good run rate as far as what you expect \u2013 as far as the effective rental growth for the pipeline?\nEric Bolton: I\u2019m sorry. Say that again.\nTom Grimes: Say that again, John. We didn\u2019t get it.\nJohn Kim: The 19.5% rent growth that you had\u2026\nEric Bolton: Yes, yes. Those are, I mean we\u2019re \u2013 we test and we would expect our return to continue absolutely.\nJohn Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, John.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nZach Silverberg: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you guys just talk about the opportunity set on your development pipeline after the two new starts, you\u2019re up to about $600 million properties under development, what type of turns are you underwriting and sort of how does that compare to the acquisition market in those specific markets?\nBrad Hill: Yes, Zach. this is Brad. I think Eric touched on it a bit in his comments. We do have a number of sites that we\u2019re currently working on \u2013 predevelopment work on; we\u2019ve got some that are owned, some that are under contract. I\u2019d say in terms of the terms that we\u2019re underwriting, not a lot different than what we\u2019ve underwritten previously. We are fortunate in our markets that the rents have continued to hold up within our markets. So, we\u2019re not often to make some aggressive assumptions with rent trending or some large recovery and rent in our underwriting. So, the two that we just started as I said in my comments, we\u2019re still looking at north of a 6% yield and certainly, that compares very favorably when you look at Class A brand-new products in our markets, what they\u2019re trading at today. So, we continue to believe in that. we have another own site that we purchased in Denver. We hope to start in 2022. We\u2019re working on a site in Tampa, a site in Raleigh. Those are likely 2022 sites as well. And then we have under our pre-purchase platform, where we\u2019ve got one in Salt Lake City that we hope to start in the second quarter. And then another site in Denver in our pre-purchase platform that we\u2019re \u2013 hopefully, we\u2019ll start in the third quarter of this year or so.\nZach Silverberg: Got you. Appreciate the color. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned it was about 3%, I think of gross assets and it was moderate risk, sort of what is the maximum and minimum risk you\u2019re willing to slide the lever on in between development?\nAl Campbell: I think we\u2019ve discussed, historically, somewhere around 4% to 5% would be a range that we would look at, I think. but when you\u2019re looking at your actual pipeline relative to your enterprise value, another aspect of risk is how much is unfunded. And so I point to this fact that we have $600 million sort of going right now, we only have a fairly small amount that\u2019s unfunded. So, I think those two factors together, it\u2019s what you would consider. So, we\u2019re definitely at the low end of the risk range on that right now. And you\u2019ll see our pipeline grow a bit at 2021 as Brad talked about and in early 2022, but certainly, a modest risk program given our profile.\nZach Silverberg: Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Rick Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRick Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And of course, Eric, I didn\u2019t expect you to open up the comments suggesting that everyone\u2019s going to move out of the Sunbelt next year. So, no surprise there. but if you do look at the statistics in the period after the last great recession 2010 timeframe, the migration out of New York, for example, substantially slowed. And you can argue that there are some real organs in a lot of other areas that you\u2019re not in that could entice people perhaps even more this time around than then. Again, it\u2019s never been positive in migration. really, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened with the Sunbelt into a market like New York, but it probably would normalize. And so when you mentioned this 12.2% of total leasing is moving from outside of your footprint, how much is that impacting your growth profile, because you really probably don\u2019t want to hang your hat on that type of level for very long.\nEric Bolton: No, I mean, I think that we still believe that a lot of the growth that we will have in demand, if you will be \u2013 people that, that have been in the Sunbelt will stay in the Sunbelt organic, if you will. So, I don\u2019t disagree that the 12%, it go back to years ago before COVID, the move-ins from outside of our footprint, we\u2019re a little over 9%. So, even compared to where we are today with COVID, it\u2019s only moved up from 9% of our movements from outside the footprint to 12% of the \u2013 so, your point is valid in that sense. It hasn\u2019t changed radically. But I just, I feel like that what we\u2019re going to find is that over the next \u2013 I think there\u2019s a real fundamental shift that has \u2013 that was in place if you will to some degree before COVID as employers and job seekers, if you will, were continually drawn to this region of the country as a consequence of all the things that you know about. And I just believe that those factors have not moderated they have not lessened. COVID accelerated them a little bit, but those trends are going to continue well past COVID. And I think that what we\u2019re finding this, particularly as some of this millennial generation continues to age, they\u2019ve moved in up in their career. They\u2019ve moved into jobs increasingly that I think offer the ability to be more remote than they have been in the past that drive that they had to be in New York and work 60 hours, 70 hours a week that was then. they\u2019re in a different place now. And I just \u2013 I feel like that a combination of frankly, the aging millennial generation and how they\u2019re lifestyle needs evolve and desires change as well as retiring baby boomers, who are looking for change and looking for a more affordable living that those two big slugs of the demographics of the U.S. the millennials in the retiring baby boomers those are huge numbers. And as those two age demographics evolve, I think the Sunbelt stands to benefit more so than some of the higher cost coastal markets. And so I\u2019ve heard somebody suggest that yes, the coastal markets are going to \u2013 the gateway markets are going to come back, but they\u2019re probably going to come back a little bit cheaper and a little bit younger than they were before and I think there\u2019s probably some truth to that.\nRick Anderson: Okay, good enough. That\u2019s good color. And then my second question, perhaps, well maybe, on the uncomfortable side, but I never shy away from that. You\u2019ve had some sort of C-suite succession activity in some of your peers, Essex UDR, AvalonBay and I wonder, to your credit, Eric, you have made MAA not an Eric Bolton show, you have a great bench there. And I think everyone recognizes that, but can you talk about how much this team right now today looks to be in place for the next at least, few, three, four years, or we can talk about the succession plan that\u2019s perhaps in place for you and others, how that dialogue is happening at the board level? Thanks.\nEric Bolton: Okay. Well, we can take a poll around the table right now if you want, but we won\u2019t do that. What I would tell you, Rich; it\u2019s a very active topic at the Board level. We discuss it to some degree at every meeting. There\u2019s active planning that\u2019s underway and continues to this day. I will tell you that I feel great and have no plans to do anything different. I don\u2019t play golf and don\u2019t really have anything else to do. So, I\u2019m focused and planned to continue in that way for some time. But as you point out, we\u2019ve got a great team, a great bench strength; the company has been through a lot in the last seven years to eight years. the team has really come together. And so we\u2019re developing in focus on leadership development and leadership succession, but frankly, we don\u2019t see a lot of change in the near-term horizon.\nRick Anderson: Eric, right. I mean, you\u2019re probably not mentioned \u00a3500 anymore either.\nEric Bolton: Now, it\u2019s down to \u00a3490.\nRick Anderson: Okay, great.\nTom Grimes: Hey, Rick. just a real quick point on what we\u2019re hanging our hat on as you mentioned earlier. I mean, supply is going to be pretty much the same. Job growth in 2020 was negative 6.1% in our markets, it\u2019s going to be plus 3%, 4% that 900 basis point swing in job growth is really what we\u2019re hanging our hat on for near-term growth.\nRick Anderson: You got it. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.\nTom Grimes: You bet.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRick Skidmore: Hey, Eric. Just a question \u2013 just with regards to how you think about development going forward, and the shift and perhaps working from home and people wanting more space, are you changing the design of the developments and does that change the economics in terms of how you think about returns as you go forward? Thanks.\nEric Bolton: Rick, I mean, we are a little bit more focused on creating workspace areas, nooks and things of that nature in a number of our apartments. And we\u2019re also very much more oriented towards outdoor amenity areas in a shared office sort of configurations in some of our leasing centers. Frankly, it\u2019s not really having much of an impact on our overall cost of build-out. And we certainly, think that there\u2019s a lot of reason to continue to introduce more of the support for work from home, but no real significant change in terms of the cost impact for us.\nRick Skidmore: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hey, good morning, everybody. Could you give us the actual data around what the ratio of jobs to new supply is in 2021 for your markets versus maybe, 2019 and some historical averages, if you have that with you?\nTom Grimes: Yes. Of course, for our group, the jobs to completion ratio last year was negative 8.1; it swings to positive 7.1. And I think we\u2019ve consistently found that 5:1 is a place, where we can grow we\u2019re at. So, it\u2019s a substantial shift and sort of the key to our rent growth aspirations.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. I appreciate the data point. And I think it kind of really goes to some of the questions that I\u2019ve heard asked and maybe, Eric, your tone, just on the recovery in your markets seems pretty upbeat, but yet when you kind of take where fourth quarter same-store revenue growth was, and you look at the midpoint of the guidance, you layer in the accelerating redevelopment, I guess, one of the questions we have, and I think others are driving at is why isn\u2019t that driving a little more reacceleration other than just the earn-in of last year\u2019s effective rents, is there anything else you\u2019ve assumed in guidance higher turnover, lower occupancy that\u2019s contributing to maybe a more muted reacceleration in 2021?\nEric Bolton: No. I think that what you have to recognize is that getting the revenue impact of pricing changes takes time, and it takes time to go up and it takes time to go down. We went into the 2020 with some of the highest earned in leasing performance that we\u2019ve ever had, and that allowed effective rent per units remain fairly strong if you will throughout 2020, which was hugely helpful. I remember late in 2019, people asking me, what I worried about. And I said, I worried about a slowdown, I worried about something happening with the economy. And in preparation for that worry, the best thing we could do is grow rents as hard as we could, even at the expense of giving up a little bit of occupancy and allow that compounding benefit to be there as a protective performance on revenues should we see the economy weaken and that certainly, helped us this past year. So, what I would tell you that, I mean, there are two things at play here that I think are going to cause the recovery process, recovery slope to be steady as opposed to being a real steep up curve if you will. one is we are still battling supply issues and we will have those supply issues throughout 2021, pretty consistent with what we saw in 2020 that we think it actually peaks in the first part of the year and probably, starts to moderate a little bit towards the back half of the year, but that\u2019s well after we get past the peak leasing season for 2020. So \u2013 and then as we pointed out the supply picture, I think improves as we get into 2022 and beyond at least for a couple of years, I think probably, by the time we get to 2024, 2025, it starts to accelerate again, as a consequence of what we see happening with permitting today. But the other factor that is at play here is that, we are still now carrying in the first quarter of this year is going to reflect the full negative impact of the pricing performance that we had to do during the spring and summer leasing season of 2020 when it was at its weakest. And so that all that\u2019s going to continue to roll through the portfolio and it will peak, we believe in the first quarter. but as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2021, where we do believe that the leasing environment will be much more positive and better than we will again, start to compound that improvement in terms of our revenue performance and it will build, and it will build by the time we get into late 2021 and particularly, as we get into 2022. So that \u2013 those two things sort of supply picture, but particularly, sort of the compounding effect of lease-over-lease pricing and what it does to revenues, it takes time for that to work through the system.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That\u2019s very helpful. And then you guys mentioned the \u2013 where you expect cap rates on dispositions this year for the assets that you have teed up, where would you pay cap rates today, just kind of across your markets. And I\u2019m curious if you have a sense of maybe, what type of growth buyers are underwriting and how far off you think you are on assets that you\u2019re betting on?\nBrad Hill: Well, Austin, this is Brad. I would say, talking about cap rates across our markets, certainly, as I mentioned, it\u2019s very aggressive on new assets for these Class A new assets in our markets that we\u2019re looking at. I would say from a growth aspect, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint what the other folks are certainly underwriting. I would say one of the things that\u2019s driving the difference in valuation, it really is leverage. Certainly, our leverage level is a lot different than high levered buyers that are looking for 65% to call it 80% leverage on some of these deals and given where interest rates are. that\u2019s a big difference in the valuation of these assets. And so I\u2019d say that that\u2019s probably one of the levers that\u2019s having a biggest impact on our ability to be able to compete with those folks.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That makes sense. Any sense where maybe, the cap rate spread is versus long-term interest rates versus a couple of years ago, has that tightened at all in your markets?\nBrad Hill: I think it\u2019s certainly pretty low. I think if we\u2019re seeing interest rates right now in that 3% to 3.5% range, it\u2019s probably come up a little bit in the last 30, 60 days or so. And you\u2019re still seeing again, cap rates in the low-threes or high-threes, low-fours, that spread is certainly low right now. And what we\u2019ll just have to see as is as interest rates move a little bit more and these LTVs change a little bit how that that filters through in pricing. We just don\u2019t know right now, there\u2019s so little assets coming to market that they\u2019re able to still find a buyer for most of these assets, but as the supply of these properties pick up and come to market, we\u2019ll just have to see if there\u2019s an impact to pricing once that picks up and the supply demand on investments here changes a bit.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you. Just one question from me. Last few quarters, the smaller markets that really outperform your larger metros, are you seeing notable, the same notable in-migration trends in the Alabama\u2019s and Memphis Greenville or is this just more of a factor of more supply hitting the larger metros a little harder?\nTom Grimes: I think, I mean, we\u2019re seeing the increase in in-migration sort of everywhere, and you do have it in places like Greenville, but it\u2019s consistent and it\u2019s been the same thing that it has been before things like BMW and BASF and Michelin, and those large international manufacturing conglomerates that are in those places. But it is \u2013 so it is \u2013 those are holding that is coming \u2013that is continuing. And then obviously, we\u2019re seeing strong results out of the \u2013 some of the larger markets than like Phoenix and Raleigh, but the spread of in-migration is fairly widespread even Huntsville is picking up some of it, because of the NASA expansions there.\nEric Bolton: And John, I would add to what Tom saying is that yes, I mean, we do see the supply pressure more pronounced generally, in the bigger markets, and that historically, has always been the case, which is why we\u2019ve always intentionally embraced a good component or a percentage of the portfolio to be invested in some of these secondary markets. We think that secondary marketing exposure does provide some downside protection to our performance profile against the pressures that often come from time to time from supply. And so those secondary markets are doing exactly what we thought they would do during this phase of the cycle.\nTom Grimes: Yes. Sorry, John, I misheard a bit there. And then I\u2019d also add in the supply as you expect and largely, no on those large markets tend to be more urban and suburban balance that we have has helped us there as well.\nJohn Pawlowski: Yes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBuck Horne: Yes. thanks for keeping the call going along. I appreciate it. I\u2019m going to ask one question then. Single-family rentals, thinking about you\u2019re seeing a lot of home builders validate the concept getting into purpose built communities of single family rentals that can operate like horizontal apartments with an amenity, maybe, in more kind of outlined locations, but definitely, Sunbelt. Does a concept like a purpose built single-family rental community potentially, offer you anything attractive in terms of diversifying the product mix, or how do you think about that concept going forward?\nEric Bolton: Well, Buck, it is something that we\u2019ve been talking about a bit. I do think that if you get a purpose built single-family rental community, where you get, if you will, all the homes in a very organized, defined sort of community footprint, let\u2019s see, along the lines of what you just described kind of a horizontal multifamily plan, if you will. Then yes, we think that there may be some logic to that. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a few examples from time to time and should \u2013 right now, of course, that that kind of opportunity is attracting a ton of capital. So, pricing is pretty competitive, but should the opportunity present itself for something that along the lines of what you\u2019re describing it would be something we would take a hard look at for sure.\nBuck Horne: All right, great. Thanks. Congrats, guys. Appreciate it.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Buck.\nTom Grimes: Thanks, Buck.\nOperator: Thanks. No further questions. I\u2019ll return the call to MAA for any closing remarks.\nTim Argo: No further comments. So, appreciate everyone joining us this morning and let us know if you have any additional questions. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note. Results were ahead of expectations and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021. During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared to prior year. And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equals the prior third quarter with particularly strong renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4. Average physical occupancy also remains strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from the performance in Q3. We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for a continued outperformance into the coming spring and summer leasing season. Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamental across the Sunbelt over the next three years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022. I believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly, strong position as we head into the recovery part of the cycle. This is Eric, Sumit, I'll add to what Brad is saying. I agree, based on everything that I've seen that it does \u2013 it would appear that the majority of a lot of the \u2013 this permitting activity is oriented more suburban in nature. But having said that, one of the things that we're really starting to see more evidence of is frankly entitlement and permitting is getting more challenging as more of this multihousing product heads to the suburbs. We're seeing a lot of \u2013 particularly, in the satellite cities, the suburban cities, if you will, that have their own school systems and their own municipal governments, they are becoming very restrictive about what they are allowing the way of apartment permitting believing that these additional households will put some level of stress on the infrastructure and we're seeing that the permitting activity is starting to get a lot more restrictive than it ever has been in a lot of these Southeastern markets. So, I think there's another if you will, a hurdle starting to develop across some of these Southeast markets that will make it increasingly a little bit more challenging to supply some of these suburban locations. Good morning. And Neil, this is Eric. just to add on to some of that detail that Tom laid out there. I do think that there are a lot of reasons to believe that a lot of this migration trend that we saw the U.S. population to the Southeast over the past year as I mentioned in my comments earlier, a lot of these trends were evident prior to COVID. COVID accelerated those trends somewhat. And I would tell you that I believe a lot of this \u2013 a lot of the moves that took place during 2020 are pretty sticky in nature. And I think that the trends are likely to continue post-COVID. I think you have to recognize a lot of these Southeastern markets. They continue to offer all the same attractive qualities that I think started the trend some years back and what is happening as more employers are bringing more knowledge-based jobs and tech jobs into this region of country. The employment base is really starting to further diversify and of course, work from home and these knowledge-based jobs allows a lot more remote working, which I think is also working in our favor. And so I think that a combination of just how these economic trends have been building, frankly, and these jobs in migration trends have been building for the last 10 years or so recognizing celebrate a little bit last year. but those trends were in place well before COVID, and I think we'll continue past COVID. the affordability of the region, particularly as it relates to housing continues to \u2013 I think be very, very attractive. It will become even more so over the next 10 years. And I think we also have to recognize that these Sunbelt markets are continuing to become very desirable places to live and what Nashville and what Austin, and what Raleigh have to offer people today, versus where they were 20 years ago is night and day difference. And so I'm very optimistic that we are at the beginning of some continued very favorable trends for housing needs throughout this region of the country. Yes. I think the idea that once the vaccine is in place and if you will, society returns to normal. the idea that there's going to be this giant reversal, our population shifts back to the gateway markets. I think that's a ridiculous argument. I don't think that's going to happen. Those trends were in place to the Southeast and Sunbelt markets before COVID. COVID accelerated a little bit and I think those trends are going to be and we learned a lot last year, and employers learned a lot in and households learned a lot. And I think the attractiveness of this region is only \u2013 is better understood today than it ever has been and I think these trends are going to continue. Well, Michael, I would tell you that my principles and sort of the philosophy that I've always had in terms of how we think about deploying capital is really continues to be grounded in the overriding belief that the most important thing that we're charged with doing is deploying capital in a manner to create the highest recurring quality revenue stream and earnings stream that we can to pay a steady growing dividend throughout the cycle. And if you will and creating a optimized, sort of full cycle performance profile. at end of the day, I think re-shareholder capital over time \u2013 over a long period of time is largely rewarded through steady earnings growth, obviously and particularly, dividend growth. And having said that, I've always believed then that the best way to accomplish that performance objective in that profile is deploy capital, where demand is likely to be the best and the strongest and growing in a consistent fashion over a long period of time. I get it that the Southeast markets for years, the argument and the criticism was that there lower barriers to supply and new supply can come in, and oversupply and market. What I would tell you is, what supply causes is it causes moderation. What demand causes is steady earnings growth over time and on a falloff in demand can have catastrophic consequences and an oversupplied market is unlikely to be catastrophic in nature. It can be weak for a year or two, but it's unlikely to trigger a massive sort of upsets your earnings stream, which can put a company in trouble, create dividend stress or things of that nature. So, I've always believed that these Sunbelt markets offer the performance profile that we're after and that's what we should be doing and where we should focus our capital. So, it's a very long answer to your question, but no \u2013 we have no interest in now using this opportunity to go into these gateway markets. I don't think our \u2013 what we're trying to do for capital for shareholder capital would not be sufficiently rewarded for pursuing that. At this point, we don't see a reason to do that and we like what we're doing. No. I get your point. And I mean, obviously, I think it depends somewhat on your investment horizon as you think about risk return or risk reward return. I think, clearly, there's going to be opportunities that are going to emerge in some of these gateway markets, where you can go in and deploy capital and make an investment and create an exceptional return on your investment. I think it somewhat depends on your horizon and how long, you want to think about the capital being deployed in that market. Again, from our perspective, we're very long-term investors, very long-term holders, and we're trying to create an earnings profile from that investment action to match up well, in terms of how we're trying to perform for capital over a long period of time. And so we just don't believe that with that horizon that we're working with and that objective that we're shooting for, that the gateway markets really aligned for us in the way we want to try to perform for capital. I'm not suggesting that focusing on those markets is wrong. And I think there are certainly ways to make a lot of money in those markets. But I think, you have to think about your horizon perhaps a little bit differently. And I will say that while we continue to see capital coming into these markets, I think that there are times, where these gateway markets over the last and this over the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, just attracting enormous amount of capital and a lot of international capital sometimes that I think, was really motivated by now semester of looking for a great return on their capital in some cases is looking for a place to preserve capital if you will. And so you get a lot of different influences with some of these bigger gateway markets and particularly, with international capital that can, I think, create some distortions from time to time, in terms of assets are being priced relative to the long-term earnings potential of the investment. So, we just see volatility and other aspects of those markets that \u2013 those gateway markets that just don't really match up well to how we're trying to perform for capital. And we're going to continue to focus on it the way we do. I think the major component that's outside of residential is really just commercial. It's only about 1.5% of our revenue stream. So, it's really minor overall, Rob. And so we we've had pretty good performance. I mean, we've looked at our tenants and we certainly have some programs to sort of rent, where we need to \u2013 but we had good collection on a lot of our tenants are fair strong, and have strong businesses that have been able to continue paying well. And so it's \u2013 so collections have been good, so it hasn't even on a small number. We've had pretty good performance still on a relative basis. I wouldn't think any stimulus check is going to help that situation, but we're frankly in such a strong position on that with our collection rate where it is, it'll help close the gap to give us back to last year, and would be welcome, but it would just primarily help a little bit. Taking away Al just said, if you take half your lease-over-lease performance \u2013 blended lease-over-lease performance for 2020 and half of your blended lease-over-lease performance for 2021 collected are together that comprises what your effective will be for the year. John, just to add to what Tom was saying that, as he mentioned, there's new product comes into the market, that really what that does is that that expands our opportunity for redevelopment. And historically, at least over the last number of years, where the redevelopment opportunity for us has been \u2013 the best has been in some of our more urban-oriented locations, which is really where the opportunity largely lies in portfolio now, particularly with the legacy post portfolio, but as new supply begins to over the next few years, if it is more oriented towards the suburban locations, that's actually going to expand our field of opportunity for more extensive redevelopment out in the suburb components of the portfolio. Because obviously, this new product is coming in at a price point that is well above our existing product and with comparable locations and comparable appeal in that regard, we can go in and make these investments with kitchen and bath upgrades and create a very competitive product and still off of the market, the renter market, a slight discount to the newer product and get great returns on capital and get great lease-up success with it. So, we think that this is a real opportunity for us over the next few years and we expect it to stay at the same high level for the next three or four years for sure. I'm sorry. Say that again. Yes, yes. Those are, I mean we're \u2013 we test and we would expect our return to continue absolutely. Thanks, John. No, I mean, I think that we still believe that a lot of the growth that we will have in demand, if you will be \u2013 people that, that have been in the Sunbelt will stay in the Sunbelt organic, if you will. So, I don't disagree that the 12%, it go back to years ago before COVID, the move-ins from outside of our footprint, we're a little over 9%. So, even compared to where we are today with COVID, it's only moved up from 9% of our movements from outside the footprint to 12% of the \u2013 so, your point is valid in that sense. It hasn't changed radically. But I just, I feel like that what we're going to find is that over the next \u2013 I think there's a real fundamental shift that has \u2013 that was in place if you will to some degree before COVID as employers and job seekers, if you will, were continually drawn to this region of the country as a consequence of all the things that you know about. And I just believe that those factors have not moderated they have not lessened. COVID accelerated them a little bit, but those trends are going to continue well past COVID. And I think that what we're finding this, particularly as some of this millennial generation continues to age, they've moved in up in their career. They've moved into jobs increasingly that I think offer the ability to be more remote than they have been in the past that drive that they had to be in New York and work 60 hours, 70 hours a week that was then. they're in a different place now. And I just \u2013 I feel like that a combination of frankly, the aging millennial generation and how they're lifestyle needs evolve and desires change as well as retiring baby boomers, who are looking for change and looking for a more affordable living that those two big slugs of the demographics of the U.S. the millennials in the retiring baby boomers those are huge numbers. And as those two age demographics evolve, I think the Sunbelt stands to benefit more so than some of the higher cost coastal markets. And so I've heard somebody suggest that yes, the coastal markets are going to \u2013 the gateway markets are going to come back, but they're probably going to come back a little bit cheaper and a little bit younger than they were before and I think there's probably some truth to that. Okay. Well, we can take a poll around the table right now if you want, but we won't do that. What I would tell you, Rich; it's a very active topic at the Board level. We discuss it to some degree at every meeting. There's active planning that's underway and continues to this day. I will tell you that I feel great and have no plans to do anything different. I don't play golf and don't really have anything else to do. So, I'm focused and planned to continue in that way for some time. But as you point out, we've got a great team, a great bench strength; the company has been through a lot in the last seven years to eight years. the team has really come together. And so we're developing in focus on leadership development and leadership succession, but frankly, we don't see a lot of change in the near-term horizon. Now, it's down to \u00a3490. Rick, I mean, we are a little bit more focused on creating workspace areas, nooks and things of that nature in a number of our apartments. And we're also very much more oriented towards outdoor amenity areas in a shared office sort of configurations in some of our leasing centers. Frankly, it's not really having much of an impact on our overall cost of build-out. And we certainly, think that there's a lot of reason to continue to introduce more of the support for work from home, but no real significant change in terms of the cost impact for us. No. I think that what you have to recognize is that getting the revenue impact of pricing changes takes time, and it takes time to go up and it takes time to go down. We went into the 2020 with some of the highest earned in leasing performance that we've ever had, and that allowed effective rent per units remain fairly strong if you will throughout 2020, which was hugely helpful. I remember late in 2019, people asking me, what I worried about. And I said, I worried about a slowdown, I worried about something happening with the economy. And in preparation for that worry, the best thing we could do is grow rents as hard as we could, even at the expense of giving up a little bit of occupancy and allow that compounding benefit to be there as a protective performance on revenues should we see the economy weaken and that certainly, helped us this past year. So, what I would tell you that, I mean, there are two things at play here that I think are going to cause the recovery process, recovery slope to be steady as opposed to being a real steep up curve if you will. one is we are still battling supply issues and we will have those supply issues throughout 2021, pretty consistent with what we saw in 2020 that we think it actually peaks in the first part of the year and probably, starts to moderate a little bit towards the back half of the year, but that's well after we get past the peak leasing season for 2020. So \u2013 and then as we pointed out the supply picture, I think improves as we get into 2022 and beyond at least for a couple of years, I think probably, by the time we get to 2024, 2025, it starts to accelerate again, as a consequence of what we see happening with permitting today. But the other factor that is at play here is that, we are still now carrying in the first quarter of this year is going to reflect the full negative impact of the pricing performance that we had to do during the spring and summer leasing season of 2020 when it was at its weakest. And so that all that's going to continue to roll through the portfolio and it will peak, we believe in the first quarter. but as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2021, where we do believe that the leasing environment will be much more positive and better than we will again, start to compound that improvement in terms of our revenue performance and it will build, and it will build by the time we get into late 2021 and particularly, as we get into 2022. So that \u2013 those two things sort of supply picture, but particularly, sort of the compounding effect of lease-over-lease pricing and what it does to revenues, it takes time for that to work through the system. And John, I would add to what Tom saying is that yes, I mean, we do see the supply pressure more pronounced generally, in the bigger markets, and that historically, has always been the case, which is why we've always intentionally embraced a good component or a percentage of the portfolio to be invested in some of these secondary markets. We think that secondary marketing exposure does provide some downside protection to our performance profile against the pressures that often come from time to time from supply. And so those secondary markets are doing exactly what we thought they would do during this phase of the cycle. Well, Buck, it is something that we've been talking about a bit. I do think that if you get a purpose built single-family rental community, where you get, if you will, all the homes in a very organized, defined sort of community footprint, let's see, along the lines of what you just described kind of a horizontal multifamily plan, if you will. Then yes, we think that there may be some logic to that. We are \u2013 we've seen a few examples from time to time and should \u2013 right now, of course, that that kind of opportunity is attracting a ton of capital. So, pricing is pretty competitive, but should the opportunity present itself for something that along the lines of what you're describing it would be something we would take a hard look at for sure. Thanks, Buck."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. While most buyers have returned to the market, the lack of available for sell properties continues to restrict transaction volume. investor demand for multi-family product within our region of the country is very strong and this supply demand imbalance is driving aggressive pricing. due to the robust demand supported by continued low interest rates, cap rates have compressed further and are frequently in the high 3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. we expect to remain active in the transaction market this year, but based on pricing levels, we're currently seeing, we're not optimistic that we will succeed in finding existing communities that will clear our underwriting hurdles in 2021. While acquiring will be a challenge as noted in the earnings guidance, we do plan to come to market with $200 million to $250 million of planned property dispositions this year. we will redeploy those proceeds into our growing development pipeline, which currently stands at $595 million with eight projects and just over 2,600 units. In the fourth quarter, we started construction on the MAA Windmill Hill in Austin, Texas, as well as Novel Val Vista, a pre-purchase in Phoenix, Arizona. both of these are lower density suburban projects that we expect to deliver stabilized NOI yields around 6%, well in excess of our current acquisition cap rates. despite increased construction costs as well as some supply chain issues related specifically to cabinets and appliances, our development and pre-purchase projects remain on budget with no significant delay concerns at this point. We have several other development sites owned or under contract that we hope to start construction on in 2021 and into 2022. we are encouraged that despite facing some supply pressure. our phase 2 lease-up property located in Fort worth continues to lease up at our original expectations, as does our soon to be completed Phase 2 in Dallas, we're over 90% of the units have been delivered. Yes. this is Brad. I would say that just giving the economics of what we're seeing today, it's really hard to underwrite more urban high density product. So, I think it's safe to assume that a higher percent of the product that's being developed today is more suburban in nature. But I'd say having said that, when we look at the spread between the rents of new supply, that's coming online versus our properties, that spread is still really good and as Eric said that, that's leading to more redevelopment opportunities for us. So, we think that that continues. It's hard to say where just looking at permitting trends while they're clearly down versus pre-COVID levels, I would say construction starts are down even more. It's hard to say just from the permitting data, where that supply is located. but my sense is that it's going to be more suburban in nature. but given the economics of where costs are the rent levels of those are still going to be pretty substantial compared to our current product. Yes, Amanda. this is Brad. I'd say that the construction financing is really kind of a mixed bag. I think it depends on a few things. One the markets that folks are looking in, certainly some markets are easier to get financing in or less hard to get financing in than others. And I think it also depends on the sponsor, I mean, I think what we're seeing is generally for the larger developers, the strong sponsors that historically, have had a pretty good pipelines. they're still able to get financing. But I think the smaller developers that do just a handful of deals a year, they're not as strong. they don't have as stronger relationship with the banks or having a little bit tougher time getting their debt financing lined up. So that certainly has been an impact in financing. And that also certainly leads to some of our pre-purchase opportunities. in terms of loan terms, we're seeing, call it, 10-year rates in that 4%, 4.5% range for a construction financing, which I think is still a decent at the moment, really, the only change that we've seen \u2013 the biggest change we've seen in construction or in financing \u2013 not construction financing, but is really, has to do with the low cap rates that we're currently seeing for where these stabilized assets, the low cap rates are starting to drive some LTV movement in order for debt service coverage ratios to continue to be held. So, we are seeing loan to values come down a bit. We're not seeing any impact yet on pricing, but we'll really just see how that unfolds later this year as more opportunities come to market, but that's basically what we're seeing at the moment. I think for our dispositions, given that we're selling \u2013 we're selling our Jackson, Mississippi portfolio, which we had on the market last year is 30-year-old, 35-year-old product in a tertiary market. You're talking 5 to 5.5 cap rate for what we'll look to sell this year. We're looking to sell properties that really don't wind up as well with our overall growth strategy. It's going to tend to be older property in some of these smaller markets initially, where really, the \u2013 after CapEx; cash flows are really not what we're looking for. And then the long-term growth is obviously, not what we're looking for as well. but on a historical basis, the cap rates for these properties are still really, really good at the moment, but I'd say, 5 to 5.5. Yes, Zach. this is Brad. I think Eric touched on it a bit in his comments. We do have a number of sites that we're currently working on \u2013 predevelopment work on; we've got some that are owned, some that are under contract. I'd say in terms of the terms that we're underwriting, not a lot different than what we've underwritten previously. We are fortunate in our markets that the rents have continued to hold up within our markets. So, we're not often to make some aggressive assumptions with rent trending or some large recovery and rent in our underwriting. So, the two that we just started as I said in my comments, we're still looking at north of a 6% yield and certainly, that compares very favorably when you look at Class A brand-new products in our markets, what they're trading at today. So, we continue to believe in that. we have another own site that we purchased in Denver. We hope to start in 2022. We're working on a site in Tampa, a site in Raleigh. Those are likely 2022 sites as well. And then we have under our pre-purchase platform, where we've got one in Salt Lake City that we hope to start in the second quarter. And then another site in Denver in our pre-purchase platform that we're \u2013 hopefully, we'll start in the third quarter of this year or so. Well, Austin, this is Brad. I would say, talking about cap rates across our markets, certainly, as I mentioned, it's very aggressive on new assets for these Class A new assets in our markets that we're looking at. I would say from a growth aspect, it's hard to pinpoint what the other folks are certainly underwriting. I would say one of the things that's driving the difference in valuation, it really is leverage. Certainly, our leverage level is a lot different than high levered buyers that are looking for 65% to call it 80% leverage on some of these deals and given where interest rates are. that's a big difference in the valuation of these assets. And so I'd say that that's probably one of the levers that's having a biggest impact on our ability to be able to compete with those folks. I think it's certainly pretty low. I think if we're seeing interest rates right now in that 3% to 3.5% range, it's probably come up a little bit in the last 30, 60 days or so. And you're still seeing again, cap rates in the low-threes or high-threes, low-fours, that spread is certainly low right now. And what we'll just have to see as is as interest rates move a little bit more and these LTVs change a little bit how that that filters through in pricing. We just don't know right now, there's so little assets coming to market that they're able to still find a buyer for most of these assets, but as the supply of these properties pick up and come to market, we'll just have to see if there's an impact to pricing once that picks up and the supply demand on investments here changes a bit."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Brad and good morning. core FFO of $1.65 per share for the fourth quarter produced full year core FFO of $6.43 per share, which represented a 2.7% growth over the prior year and as well above our internal expectations following the breakout of the pandemic. stable occupancy, strong collections and positive pricing performance were the primary drivers of continued same-store revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which was 1.8%. And for the full year, which is 2.5%. As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk internet program, which is included in utilities expenses. And now, some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating expenses to begin moderating this year, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth quarter, but we continue to fund development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs. As Brad mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to eight deals with total projected costs of $595 million. Yes, just looking for the future in our \u2013 what we have in our forecast, the 2% overall. I mean, I think you just think about the markets and some of the markets that we're thinking would be the strongest as Tom talked about and mentioned Phoenix, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, some of the ones that are going to be okay. markets that are going to be reasonable, it's still challenging Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, and then some of the more challenging markets, Houston, Orlando and D.C. And I think all of those together and basically, the pricing trends we see right now and expect for the year, given the job growth comes the 2% expectation. Yes. Nick, this is Al. I think \u2013 and just overall, I mean, just given the uncertainty that's in the marketplace, I think that the first quarter being the first quarter of the year and where you have the most uncertainty, I think the range was just to reflect that. And I think the driver for the forecast for the whole year is based on revenue performance and so I think that's the key to be the top or the bottom of the range and really, for the year or for the quarters. And I think the first quarter, as talked about a little bit in the comments is expected to be the lowest revenue quarter for the year, but that's really reflecting effective rent per unit, which is a combination, which is a backward or a trailing indicator, which is combination of the pricing you did last year, plus what you're doing this year. And so we're expecting improving pricing trends, but the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter, because it will reflect really, the bulk of last year's pricing, which was 1.3% on average and we certainly expect that to be higher in 2021 based on the forecast we're pleading together. So that's really the key factors. Hope that answers your question. I think recurring CapEx can be \u2013 it can be the timing of certain jobs, whether it's some of the significant jobs like paint jobs, and some of the things of that nature. I think over time, we expect for what we put recurring and revenue enhancing together, and we'd expect to spend call it 1,100 per unit to 1,200 per unit those two together in 2021, which is fairly significant to what 2020 was, but somewhere in that field for the long-term. Well, John, this is Al. The effective rent growth talk \u2013 we've talked a moment ago about that a bit. I think that's more of a trailing indicator. It's a combination of all the leases you have in place right now. And so the pricing performance we had for 2020 was 1.3% on average. And so while projecting for 2020 is certainly higher than that. I think you could do the math, but this is a rough approach, but it's been a pretty easy way to look at it is take half of what we did in 2020 and half of what we expect to do in 2021, and that'll drive your effective rent growth of 1.7%. So, you can do the math on that back into we're expecting something in the 2% to 2.5% range on pricing in the first quarter was, I mean, the January was a good indication toward that. And that's the back of the envelope way to do it. But I think if you do that, given that we have at leases an average of a year that works out pretty close and you can get to where we are in our forecast. I think we've discussed, historically, somewhere around 4% to 5% would be a range that we would look at, I think. but when you're looking at your actual pipeline relative to your enterprise value, another aspect of risk is how much is unfunded. And so I point to this fact that we have $600 million sort of going right now, we only have a fairly small amount that's unfunded. So, I think those two factors together, it's what you would consider. So, we're definitely at the low end of the risk range on that right now. And you'll see our pipeline grow a bit at 2021 as Brad talked about and in early 2022, but certainly, a modest risk program given our profile."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through the fourth quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter. In addition to the improvement in occupancy, we're able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter in line with the third quarter at an 80 basis point increase. All in place rents are effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved 1.3% for the fourth quarter. As noted in the release collections during the quarter, we're strong. We collected 99.2% of build rent in the fourth quarter. This is the same result we have in the third quarter of 2020. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The numbers of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 491 for the January rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. We saw a steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we made progress on our interior unit redevelopment program, as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controls, lights, thermostat, and security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2020, we installed 23,950 Smart Home packages and completed just over 4,200 interior unit upgrades. January's collections are in line with the good results we saw in the fourth quarter as of January 31, we've collected 98.7% of rent build, which is comparable to the month end number for the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Leasing volume in January was strong, up 4.9% from last year. Blended lease-over-lease rent growth effective during January exceeded last year's results for the first time since March. Effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for January was positive 2.2%, a 40 basis improvement from the prior year. Effective new lease pricing for January was negative 1.8%. This is a 70 basis point improvement from January of last year. January renewals effective during the month were up 6.3%. Our customer service scores improved to 110 basis points over the prior year. This aids to our retention trends, which are positive for January, February and March, as well as lease-over-lease renewal rates for those months, which are in the 5.5% to 6.5% range. Yes, I'll start with that one. And I'll let Tim or Al wrapped up on the forecast. What I would tell you is, as I mentioned in the call, the thing that is most different for us in 2021 is the shift in the swing in jobs bringing from negative 6.4 to positive 3.4, and that's going to be the thing that drives us in that moves \u2013 that moves across the markets. We see that at the high end, where we'll continue to see markets like Tampa and Raleigh, and Phoenix and Jacksonville accelerate. but we'll also see it in places like Orlando in Houston and D.C., which are weaker now, but they will begin to improve as job growth comes to play in those markets. Yes, Neil. it's Tom. I'll jump in on that one, if that's all right. Move-ins from people moving into our footprint from outside of our footprint was 12.2% of total move-ins in fourth quarter. that's the highest we've seen and reflects the steady upward trend that we've seen over the past couple of years. It was \u2013 for context, it was 9.2% in Q1 of 2019. So, almost a 300 basis point increase, we've seen that steadily happening from 2019 on, just to give you a little bit more color on the Q4 move-ins, New York move-ins, move-ins from New York state were up 36%. And apartment searches \u2013 we pull some information from Google, apartment searches in Atlanta were up 60% in New York city, move-ins from Massachusetts were up 43% and apartments in Raleigh searches were up 68% in Boston. And trends go on from there. The other notable is probably California, which is up 60% and apartments in Austin searches were up 90% in Los Angeles. Hey, Neil, it's Tom. I mean, nothing \u2013 I mean, zero reticence I would say, we're quite pleased with the way the market conditions are going at this point. In the fourth quarter, home buying this time was up slightly by like three percentage points is a move-out reason or about 200 move-outs on total. So, I mean, we saw a little bit there. but as you look forward, our accept rates are at their normal level. So, we're not seeing any turnover go up over time there. And home renting is a flat again, so that continues not to be a major factor. We agree with you that the overall, home buying market certainly getting stronger and we wouldn't surprise to see that tick up from time to time, but it is \u2013 it's really reflective of a strong jobs market and a good economy, and that produces jobs and frankly, jobs are the thing that drive our business. So, it would be my thought thus far. Thank you, Neil. We do too. The spread is always going to be kind of the widest at this time of the year, because new lease pricing is at its most challenged, but the \u2013 that delta and that delta will close over time. but that gap will always be there. And the \u2013 really, the variation is with a new renter, they have a level of leverage, because they're shopping and they can move anywhere and their switching costs are really the same. if we have done our job and provided good resident service and taking care of the residents and frankly, a pretty challenging time. We've earned the opportunity, because we've created for value to charge a little bit more. And so that is where we have the most pricing power, because we've worked with them, we've earned them and their switching costs are a little bit higher. So that delta that you talked about has always been there. It is widest in this time of year and it will be tightest in the summer months, but we expect that and we plan for that and we ask our residents for a little more to reflect the value that we've created for them. Yes. And I would add, we had a little bit bigger jump from 2019 to 2020 in recurring CapEx, but for 2021, we're projecting a very modest increase in terms of recurring CapEx. In terms of the pipeline going forward, we'll do over 5,000 units and 2021 towards that. But what we found John over time is that as we move forward our product ages another year and new supplies brought into the market. So, I would be surprised if we ever blew through our potential on that, but at this rate, it would be about three years, but I would expect us to see the pipeline grow over time as new properties are added to it as market conditions change, product added \u2013 product is added and product ages. Say that again, John. We didn't get it. Hey, Rick. just a real quick point on what we're hanging our hat on as you mentioned earlier. I mean, supply is going to be pretty much the same. Job growth in 2020 was negative 6.1% in our markets, it's going to be plus 3%, 4% that 900 basis point swing in job growth is really what we're hanging our hat on for near-term growth. You bet. Yes. Of course, for our group, the jobs to completion ratio last year was negative 8.1; it swings to positive 7.1. And I think we've consistently found that 5:1 is a place, where we can grow we're at. So, it's a substantial shift and sort of the key to our rent growth aspirations. I think, I mean, we're seeing the increase in in-migration sort of everywhere, and you do have it in places like Greenville, but it's consistent and it's been the same thing that it has been before things like BMW and BASF and Michelin, and those large international manufacturing conglomerates that are in those places. But it is \u2013 so it is \u2013 those are holding that is coming \u2013that is continuing. And then obviously, we're seeing strong results out of the \u2013 some of the larger markets than like Phoenix and Raleigh, but the spread of in-migration is fairly widespread even Huntsville is picking up some of it, because of the NASA expansions there. Yes. Sorry, John, I misheard a bit there. And then I'd also add in the supply as you expect and largely, no on those large markets tend to be more urban and suburban balance that we have has helped us there as well. Thanks, Buck."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 29, 2020. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. \nTim Argo: Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO, Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions. \n Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release, and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. \n During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. \n I will now turn the call over to Eric. \nH. Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Results for the third quarter were ahead of our expectations. Cash collections on rents build in the third quarter were strong and October trends are the same. While we still have a long way to go in capturing full economic recovery, we are encouraged by the early signs of improvement evident in our third quarter results. Leasing traffic was well ahead of prior year. On a lease-over-lease basis, new move in rent pricing meaningfully improved as compared to the second quarter. \n Overall, net effective rents were 1.8% higher than Q3 of last year and average daily occupancy remained strong at 95.6%. As a result, we captured positive sequential revenue growth in each of our markets as compared to the second quarter. Demand is strong across our footprint and growing. While we expect new supply levels to remain elevated for the next few quarters, forecast for new deliveries and the trends for permits for new construction suggest moderation in deliveries beginning in the back half of next year and significantly declining into 2022. \n We continue to make progress on our new development pipeline with construction and scheduled deliveries on track to our performance where we are underway with initial leasing, both our leasing trajectory and rents are in line with our expectations. We are in active predevelopment work on several other new development projects that we hope to start next year. We believe MAA's strategy, with a focus on the Sunbelt region uniquely diversified across both large and mid-tier markets and serving a broad segment of the rental market. \n As the company well positioned to continue to work through the challenges presented by the current economic slowdown. As the economy begins to recover post COVID, we believe our markets will continue to outperform, capturing employment trends and a demand for housing that will be well above national averages. \n MAA is well positioned for a coming recovery cycle. To our team of MAA associates, thank you for your tremendous work and commitment to our mission over the busy summer leasing season. You have again exceeded expectations, and as a result, have us well positioned as we head into next year. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. \nThomas L. Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through a busy season. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 11%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.4% in the second quarter to 95.6% in the third quarter. \n In addition to strengthening occupancy by 20 basis points, we were also able to drive new lease pricing improvement. Effective new lease pricing during the quarter improved 140 basis points from the second quarter to the third. All in-place rents on a year-over-year basis were up 1.8%, and turnover for the quarter was down 2.7% versus last year. \n These improvements were supported by an increase in lead-generating marketing spending. We're pleased with the resulting improvements in occupancy and new lease pricing mentioned earlier. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the second quarter, we restarted our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package. That includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. \n Year-to-date, we have installed 22,000 smart home packages and completed 3,300 interior unit upgrades. As noticed in the supplemental document collections during the quarter were strong. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistants dropped with each month. In April, we had 5,600 residents on the relief plans. The number of participants decreased over time and it's just 470 for the October rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. \n October collections are running slightly ahead of the good results we saw in the third quarter. As of October 26, we've collected 98.6% of rent build for October. This is a 20 basis point improvement from what we saw on average for July, August and September for the same-day of the month, including deferred payments for COVID-19 effective resident payment plans referenced in the COVID-19 disclosure, we have accounted for 98.8% of October build rent. \n Leasing volume for October is on track to exceed last year. Effective new lease pricing for October-to-date is negative 2%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter, effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for October month-to-date is 1.3%, a 50 basis point improvement from the third quarter. A high percentage of our current residents are choosing to stay with us, and our resident renewal and retention trends are positive. October, November and December lease-over-lease renewal rates signed at this time are in the 4.5% to 5.5% range. \n In addition to the positive leasing trends, occupancy has also strengthened. Occupancy has improved from a low point of 95.1% in May to 95.7% today. Average daily occupancy for the month is 95.6%, which is even with October of last year. 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, has dropped from a high of 9.2% in May to 6.8% in October. This low level of exposure also matches the same time last year and has us well positioned for the slower winter leasing season. \n I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They served and cared for our residents and our associates well and have grappled with the constantly changing implications COVID-19. They've also worked diligently to adapt to new business conditions and drive our recovery. I'm proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. Brad? \nBrad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter transaction volume picked up from second quarter, but still remains down significantly year-over-year, and we expect the volume to continue to be slow into next year. Because of the desirability of our markets, we continue to see robust buyer demand for existing assets within our footprint. This strong demand, coupled with very attractive debt rates, has further compressed cap rates, and in some cases, is resulting in pricing above pre-COVID levels, despite lower NOI's. We continue to expect our best buying opportunities on existing assets to be owned properties and their initial lease-up, where we believe pressure is likely to continue to build through the winter. \n With that said, we've only seen a few lease-up opportunities come up and pricing trends are mixed. All cash buyers and strong sponsors with established agency relationships remain the most aggressive bidders, while leverage buyers are having more difficulty obtaining financing on prestabilized properties. We do expect cap rates within our footprint to remain at historical lows and perhaps continue to trend lower, likely making acquisitions a smaller contributor to our external growth for some time. \n As mentioned last quarter, we expect our in-house development and our prepurchase platform to be significant contributors to our external growth going forward and anticipate starting construction on a number of these projects later this year and into next. While cap rates on acquisitions have compressed, yields on developments remain attractive. Rents and occupancy are holding up in our markets and despite cost pressure in a couple of line items, especially lumber, developments continue to underwrite to a positive spread to cap rates on stabilized properties. \n As shown in our supplemental, we have 6 development projects that are underway and all remain on budget and on-time, despite working through some minor supply chain issues. Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on the land parcel in the northern suburb of Austin that we purchased back in January. This 350 unit project should begin leasing in the first half of 2022, when we expect leasing conditions to be significantly stronger than they are today. \n While early reports show 2021 deliveries in line with this year's levels, data and permitting and construction starts show a material decline since March and point to a drop in future deliveries beginning late next year and into 2022, lining up well with the expected delivery of any new development we start. \n That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Al. \nAlbert M. Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO of $1.57 per share for the quarter, which was slightly better than our internal expectations as operating performance, corporate overhead costs and interest costs were all better-than-expected for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, stable occupancy, strong builds in effective rents and continued strong collection supported the third quarter performance, while improving pricing trends position the portfolio well for the fourth quarter. \n As Tom mentioned -- excuse me, we have established a reserve for bad debts at quarter end sufficient to fully cover uncollected rent from rests not working with us on payment plans as well as for a large portion of the remaining deferral program payments. Our collections experience for those have been very good today. \n As discussed in our release last quarter, we expected some pressure in property operating expenses over the back half of the year. The majority of the increase for the third quarter was related to growth in real estate taxes, insurance and marketing costs as well as impact on a utility costs on the double-play bulk Internet program, all discussed last quarter. \n A couple of unusual items affecting the quarter were an unexpected increase in Austin tax rates related to a recent approval by the city to bring forward funding for a light rail system, which was approved during the quarter and actually goes before voters next week. In addition, we did occur about $750,000 of unexpected storm cleanup costs during the third quarter, which also contributed to the growth. \n Our balance sheet remains strong, with low leverage and significant capacity from cash and remaining borrowing potential under our line of credit, combining for $980 million of capacity. We funded $50 million of development costs during the quarter with the expectation of funding around $260 million for the full year, including the purchase of land parcels for future deals. \n As Brad mentioned, the acquisition environment remains challenging, so we expect the majority of investment opportunities over the next few quarters to be in-house development or pre purchase development deals, which both have long-term funding commitments. And thus, we expect our development pipeline to increase over the next few quarters, but remain well within the risk tolerance ranges we've always had. \n We completed a successful bond deal early in the quarter, taking advantage of the low rate environment to issue $450 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.7%. This funding was ultimately used to repay some secured debt maturing later this year as well as prepay a $300 million term loan during in 2022. We have no remaining current maturities or future maturities with low prepayment costs, so we don't anticipate additional debt or equity funding needs for the remainder of this year. \n And finally, as reflected in our release, recent trends have been encouraging, there's still significant uncertainties remaining, thus, we refrained from providing guidance for the remainder of the year, but plan to revisit the decision as we prepare for our fourth quarter release with the expectation of being able to provide guidance for 2021. \n That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call over to you for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: Al, you just mentioned that there are some uncertainties remaining that basically allowed you to refrain from providing guidance for the year. Can you just elaborate on what some of those uncertainties are at this point? \nAlbert M. Campbell: Yes, John, I appreciate that question. I think as we look at whether there's continuation of certain government programs, the recent potential rise in COVID cases in our region, timing of reopening plans that continue in our region related to these states. And so all these things continue to bring risk. And as we mentioned, I mean, we are very encouraged with the trends, but just given that it was 1 quarter remaining in the year, we felt it prudent to refrain completing that out right now. We hope to be and feel like we'll be in a position, assuming continued stability in overall marketplace and environment to put full guidance out for 2021. \nJohn Kim: And with your cost of capital coming down, at least on the debt side, with your recent debt raise of 1.7. How does this change at all as far as how you underwrite investments? \nAlbert M. Campbell: I don't want to change. I mean, we continue to underwrite in a similar manner. I think what it does is it certainly provides the potential for very strong yields, gaps and the spread capture on some of these new development deals that brand, whether they're in-house development or prepurchase. And so that's why we talked about the remaining -- the capacity we have. And also, we talked about in the past, John, that we have a potential on our balance sheet to invest in $750 million before really impacting our leverage level. \n So I think we would say that -- and I talked about in the comments this morning, we do expect over the next couple of quarters on development pipeline to grow because that's where the opportunity is. And as you point out, those 6 yields that we're putting in place compared to that [ 1 to 7 ] debt funding cost is very attractive. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. \nNicholas Joseph: It's obviously been a very different operating year thus far. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about seasonality versus the normal patterns and how that impacts your operating strategy over the next few months in terms of focusing on occupancy or rate? \nThomas L. Grimes: Yes. Nick, it's Tom. I think what we've enjoyed thus far, frankly, is pricing that has been unseasonal as you mentioned, normally our effect of new lease pricing peaks late July. Thus far, its peaked late August -- or excuse me, late October, with steady trends as it goes. I would expect, as we move into the fourth quarter, that we would see a seasonal falloff in sort of demand as we usually do and that new lease pricing will drop modestly, and that we'll be able to hold on or in the range of our current level of occupancy. That said, what I think will continue to grow, which are renewal rates that were effective in the third quarter or just 3.8. I think we'll see renewal rates continue to improve as we move through the fourth quarter. That's not something that's usual that seasonal, and that we'll see those in the 4.5% to 5.5% range for the fourth quarter. \nNicholas Joseph: And then just maybe specifically on D.C., it's a little unique relative to the rest of your portfolio. So what are you seeing on the ground there? And how you use in any concession? \nThomas L. Grimes: I'm sorry, Nick, I missed which market you were asking about? \nNicholas Joseph: Washington, D.C. and the Greater [indiscernible] area. \nThomas L. Grimes: Yes, absolutely. Yes, D.C. is a little bit different. Honestly, occupancy there is strong at 96.4%. The pricing has been weak. And as we go around the horn, we're seeing concession levels in D.C. Proper at 2 months unstabilized; Pentagon City, Crystal City, about 2 months; Tyson's corner, 2 months; Alexandria, pretty similar; Maryland and Northern Virginia are a little bit stronger, but both seeing a month 3 in those markets. So D.C. is 1 where we're stable on occupancy, but pricing growth remains elusive at the moment. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Just curious, you referenced permitting levels declining. Fundamentals have been relatively stable and supply is expected to fall off. I guess, why do you think there hasn't been a pickup in construction activity at this point? Anything the supply chain challenges, I think you referenced or difficulty getting financing? And then just curious if there's any offsetting items from the pressure on lumber prices that Brad referenced and where you think kind of construction costs are versus pre-COVID levels? \nBrad Hill: Austin, this is Brad. I think certainly, in terms of construction costs, we've seen a strong rise in lumber, but it's been pretty volatile. We've seen a strong run-up since COVID. We have seen some relief there in the last 30 days or so, but it's still a pretty big unknown in terms of our construction cost. And we're really not seeing any other line items at the moment that are providing relief or offsetting some of that. It's just not happening. At the moment, in terms of seeing our -- not seeing construction tick up based on the permitting data we're seeing, I think it's -- I think financing is certainly a big part of that. When we started out of COVID equity was a little nervous. And so second quarter was tough. Equity folks backed out of a number of development deals. That's kind of -- since it's come back. \n And now I think the difficulty is more on the construction side or getting construction loans, that's very, very difficult for folks at the moment. And I think that's giving us some additional opportunities on our prepurchase platform, just based on the way we've structured that. But I think fundamentally, our markets continue to underwrite well for new development. You've got the -- certainly, the construction cost pressure a bit, but we see some mitigating circumstances there being the lower supply that we're talking about at late 2021 and into 2022 that the permitting data is showing. So we feel good about anything that we are developing today and putting a shovel on the ground on today. But I think the financing environment for folks -- for a number of folks out there is a little bit more difficult. \nAustin Wurschmidt: How robust is that pipeline of prepurchase opportunities? Has there been any change in pricing there? And then do you think as the transaction market general loosens up that maybe that spurs a little more activity in the construction market? \nBrad Hill: Perhaps. I mean, in terms of the -- what we're seeing on the prepurchase side, I mean, again, we're evaluating a lot of deals. As equity-backed out in the second quarter, we had a lot come forward to us. And then as I said, we've got our ability to provide the debt on our prepurchase platform is kind of a differentiator for us. And for folks that -- a lot of the established developers that we're doing business with, they have the capacity and the ability to go out and get debt, but we just provide a better option for them. So we're seeing a lot of opportunities there. We've got 2 that we hope to start in the coming quarters and in others that are in daily for us to evaluate. So we're optimistic that, that platform continues to perform and to provide opportunities for us. \nH. Bolton: And Austin, this is Eric. I'll add to what Brad is saying that we've got repurchase opportunities or predevelopment opportunities, I'll say, that we're working, including both in-house and on the prepurchase platform that Brad mentioned. We're working opportunities that we have tied up in Tampa, Raleigh, Denver, Phoenix. we're also actually looking at opportunity in a new market for us of Salt Lake City, which we hope we can start on next year. So we've got a number of things we're looking at. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. \nNeil Malkin: First off, congrats to your collections are remarkable as if there is no pandemic though. You guys are obviously doing something right. First question, I've been hearing more anecdotally about this, and I think it's increased with COVID. But are you seeing more inflow at your market from California, New York, Boston into Sunbelt Phoenix market? I think have you noticed a tick up since April. Any commentary there on how people are choosing to live now that remote -- work remotely is more accepted and the need -- the desire to get away from the sort of densely populated areas has increased? \nThomas L. Grimes: Sure, Neil. We've seen -- we didn't see much of that in the second quarter, but it's picked up in the third quarter. And most of the -- majority of our move-ins come from within the Sunbelt. So keep in mind that these numbers that I'm going to throw at you represent a relatively low percentage of our total move-ins. But they are growing. So New York -- move-ins from New York is up double digits; moving from Massachusetts are up about 9.2%; Pennsylvania 10%; and California, almost 8%. And then sort of anecdotally, we spend a good amount of time digging into the Google Analytics stuff. We're also seeing searches from those areas. For instance, like if you pick a search phrase like apartments in Atlanta, that's up 44% over prior year from addresses in the New York area. Apartments in Raleigh is up 22% from our searches in the Massachusetts area. So it's not a driver of our business at this point, but there's certainly evidence to suggest that this is a continuing trend. \nNeil Malkin: Yes. I appreciate that. Other question I have is on the single-family side. Your markets are great. The one thing is the home prices are more affordable, but just wondering given the increase in homeownership, mortgage applications, new and existing home sales, are you seeing any increase in the move-out for home purchases or single-family rental, again but over the same sort of like since maybe April and May. Any color there would be great? \nThomas L. Grimes: Yes. On new home buying, that's remained relatively flat at 19.5% of our move-outs. So that has been steady as it goes. And then move out to single-family rentals have stayed well below 6%. Certainly, those are -- those businesses are doing well out there, but we're not seeing them drive an increase in turnover at this point. And we think people are with our demographic, which is in majority female, single and not at the phase where they're making those changes. We are not -- we're just not seeing a ton of shift in that direction in our move-outs. \nNeil Malkin: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just along, how many people not answered those surveys? Like those percentages you're did 10% of the people move out the surveys. Is it 50%? It's like how good of a sample size is that? \nThomas L. Grimes: It's roughly 100%. I mean we don't -- I'd say roughly just because I hadn't checked the number in the last couple of days, but that is -- we -- that's not a survey that's sent after the fact. That is a -- when you offer a notice to us, that's a required field for them to fill out and capture. So it is -- that's where we're getting that information. It is a part of our transaction for accepting the notice. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nNicholas Yulico: Just a question on renewals. It's impressive you guys have been able to keep your renewals close to 5% in terms of the growth. How do you guys feel about still being able to stay in that 4% to 5% range in this environment? \nThomas L. Grimes: Pretty confident in and just to reset a little bit, in Q3, the renewals came down to 3.8%. And now we're seeing them move back in the 4.5% and 5%. Honestly, our 2 to 3-year average, there's probably 6%. So we're still a little below that. We feel quite confident in our ability to continue to maintain those rates as long as we continue to do our job and create value for our residents. We feel like renewals is a place where we have the most pricing power, and that hasn't changed through this process. So we feel confident in our ability to continue that. \nH. Bolton: Yes. And I would add, Nick, that I think people are probably a little -- residents are a little bit more sticky right now than perhaps they've ever been just as a consequence of COVID and the challenges of moving have always been there, but with COVID on the landscape, I think it probably helps in that regard as well. So we continue to feel that now is the time to -- as Tom says, if we're doing a great job on service, which I know we are at our locations, it makes sense to continue to push that to the extent that we monitor how much move out we're creating as a consequence of that and ready to back off and if we need to. But at this point, no signs that we need to do that. \nNicholas Yulico: Okay. Thanks, Eric. I think Sumit Sharma has a question as well. \nSumit Sharma: Guys, just really quickly, we've been listening to a lot of developers in your markets talk about an increase in investment. So maybe you could walk us through some of the markets where you're seeing the most supply growth? And importantly, and this might be a long-term question, but still very interested. How concerned are you on shadow supply growth, let's say, from older office buildings or retail redevelopments? \nBrad Hill: Well, this is Brad. I think in terms of the shadow development, I don't think we're seeing a lot of that in our markets at the moment. I think what we certainly see is the repurposing of retail spaces into apartments, but the retail getting torn down. I think we're doing that at our West property in Denver, where we're tearing down an older underutilized retail space to put in apartments. I think we'll see some of that. But I don't know that we're going to see -- we're certainly not seeing right now repurposing of hotels or anything like that within our markets at the moment. But in terms of supply that we're seeing increases in, let me get my reply\u2026 \nThomas L. Grimes: I think in terms of looking forward on that, we're in the process of really going through our study, Fred's team does an unbelievable job. They're really diving into the markets and understanding and what the implications are for us for 2021. So we're doing our study of the market. We're doing our study of the radius of our market exactly how it affects us. And we'll have more on that in the fourth quarter. But what we are showing really is a falloff in supply in the back half of year for a range of reasons that were mentioned earlier. \nSumit Sharma: [indiscernible] anyone else? \nThomas L. Grimes: I'm sorry, we didn't understand that. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. \nAlex Kalmus: So obviously, you have pretty strong top line growth compared to some of your peers that we're seeing in the urban market. Do you attribute the success figure [indiscernible] success reasoning? Would it be more because you're the urban footprint of your markets? Or is this a market selection? \nAlbert M. Campbell: Well, I think that if you look at our portfolio, I think that it really is -- it starts with the overall Sunbelt footprint, obviously, but where we are seeing stronger performance occur is particularly in some of our mid-tier markets where the supply pressures at the moment are not quite as significant. So some of our mid-Tier component of our strategy, mid-tier market component of our footprint is certainly helpful at this point. And then if you look at a submarket level, we have a higher percent of our portfolio is suburban in non-urban core. And that orientation of the portfolio, I think, is also a big contributor to our ability to sort of weather these downturns in a better fashion. \nAlex Kalmus: Got it. And turning to the smart home units. I'm assuming you're installing those on turns, but there is some lease-over-lease declines in the new lease. So should we think of this $25 premium as a mitigant to the declines? Or is there some sort of A/B testing that drives that 25 premium? \nThomas L. Grimes: Yes. So we're actually doing those on turns and occupied and really, the majority, we just got back on it in the third quarter, and most of those units got completed a late third quarter. So when we have -- we do not -- when we do it on an occupied unit, we do not immediately put that price increase on it resets at the renewal. And then on new leases, we rent them with it. And that is a bump, but it is not a material bump in the third quarter, a lease-over-lease new lease numbers. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. \nRobert Stevenson: Tom, when you adjust for urban versus suburban or just looking at sort of the suburban asset, et cetera, any differential in operating performance between price point within the various markets? Mean, in other words, a $2 square foot suburban, 2 bedroom, leasing any differently than $1.75, any difference of price point between sort of same product, same market or submarket? And then any difference in demand between larger and smaller floor plates the 850 square foot 2-bedroom units versus the 1,100 square foot, 2-bedroom units? Any color there? \nThomas L. Grimes: Yes. Consistently, across the board, I mean you've touched on urban is -- our suburbans running a little stronger than urban. And then also a or higher price point is running a little weaker than B. B is strong. So B suburban is the best, and that plays out whether you're in the suburban or in the urban areas. On the unit types, it is -- we're majority 1 in 2 bedrooms. And in terms of our current exposure level and the current lease level growth for 1s and 2s, they're incredibly consistent. 1s are slightly ahead of 2, but it's by a negligible amount. The floor plan that is a little less popular right now is our efficiencies. They are running closer to 95% occupied on an average basis with more like 8% exposure and not terribly surprising. But to put that in perspective, that efficiencies are 4% of our exposure and 1s and 2s are like 88%. So the one little less favorable floor plan that we have right now is just 4% exposure. \nRobert Stevenson: Then what about bigger versus smaller within the same number of bedrooms, like that large -- are the large 2 bedrooms now getting more attention for people looking for that extra space than the smaller 2 bedrooms. People looking for that extra 150, 200 square feet. \nThomas L. Grimes: I think that's honestly skewed a little bit by the A/B because our B assets and suburban assets tend to be a little bit larger. So if we looked at the numbers, yes, that would be the case. But I think that has to do with more the construction type and just sort of differences between our B product and our suburban product versus our A product and our urban product. \nRobert Stevenson: Okay. And then the other one for me is, are you guys seeing any markets that appear to be deteriorating on you noticeably, operationally at this point where you expect as you head into 2021, the things are going to continue to get weaker, adjusting for whatever happens with the economy, but where today, it looks weaker than it did last month? \nThomas L. Grimes: Not a dramatic falloff. I think Houston and D.C., we're watching carefully as well as Orlando. But those are more sort of like bumping along than falling off materially. \nOperator: We will take the next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. \nJohn Pawlowski: Tom, maybe just following up on a market question. You touched about supply in some of this -- maybe it was Eric, lower supply in some of the secondary markets. In the quarter, sequentially, your smaller markets really outperformed your larger markets. Curious if there was an outsized lift from the Double Play package? Or if it's just true organic demand or supply, differences versus the larger markets? \nThomas L. Grimes: No. I mean, double play is really spread across the portfolio by tight fairly evenly. So no, there is not -- it is not that Double Play is not adversely or positively affecting one market or the other on the revenue or expense on. \nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then, Al, last question for me. You talked about Austin property taxes. Nashville in recent months has increased property taxes as well. Are there any other markets you're hearing chatter across the Sunbelt where just property taxes to fund the growth of cities and infrastructure cities is becoming more topical? \nAlbert M. Campbell: Certainly a topical conversation right now. I wouldn't say that there's informal areas that where we're seeing right now that would be the next one to be a significant increase. Certainly going into the year, Nashville and Austin, both unexpected and were significant increases. And some question that a lot of municipalities are dealing with budget issues now. And so we're certainly watching that and monitoring. I think it's not just us in our region, it's nationwide in many markets. I would say this year, you're not seeing valuation relief yet because people are looking backwards. Maybe as we move into next year, you get a little bit of valuation relief and then the millage rates they're still in question because of all these issues that the municipalities are dealing with. So we're watching that closely, John. That's a long answer to say nothing specific, but certainly top of mind right now. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. \nRichard Skidmore: Just a follow-up, perhaps I missed it, but what's driving the 2% decline in new lease rate in October? Is that just supply in the markets? Because it seems like you've talked about strong demand and good occupancy, just -- and lower turnovers. So I'm just trying to understand what's happening there. \nThomas L. Grimes: No. I mean I think it's just a difference in timing and seasonality. So from -- on an effective basis or when new lease rates that moved in, in October, they're actually up sequentially. New leases if you're looking at the new leases if you're looking at the supplemental or down slightly, which is what I mentioned earlier, I think we'll see normal seasonal trends on pricing as we head into November, December. The odd thing is, is that new lease pricing climbed, honestly, from May to October. And usually, it peaks in July for effective. And then the other thing that will be different for us in the fourth quarter in terms of pricing is that you're going to see renewal rates move back up into the 4.5% and 5% range, whereas normally, they might be coming down from 7% to 6% or 5.5% in a normal seasonal pattern. \nRichard Skidmore: And then just a follow-up. Al, you talked about the new development pipeline and being within the historical range. Can you just frame for us what that historical range should be as some of these projects that you have are moving off being completed in 2021, what sort of scale we might be thinking, whether it's number of projects, number units, total capital, however you might frame that new supply pipeline? \nAlbert M. Campbell: I think what I was trying to indicate was we've talked about a range of tolerance we would have for our pipeline overall, given our balance sheet. And typically, we've said 4% or 5% of our balance sheet, of course, an $18 billion balance sheet, that's a significant number. And so I think we would see -- we're certainly -- I made the comment because the opportunities that Brad mentioned, will be there in the development pre purchase as well as in house. The yields are very good relative to financing costs. We'll certainly see that increase. And we have room in our balance sheet to use that for a while to fund those maintaining -- I put the range out there. Over the long term, we certainly want to protect and maintain our balance sheet ratios where they are. So 4% to 5%, that gives you $800 million or so, a little more we could work with. And in the long term, we'll probably see that come back down into where we are now over a long period of time. \nOperator: We'll go next to Amanda with Baird. \nAmanda Sweitzer: Great. I wanted to ask on your renovation project, and it was certainly nice to see kind of the slight acceleration in the rent premium achieved for those units. But are there any markets today where you pause renovations due to more challenging fundamentals? And then how are you thinking about the potential pipeline for renovation or redevelopment projects next year? \nThomas L. Grimes: Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Amanda. And yes, there is some difference. We brought back about 80% of our units. And 80% of the properties where we're doing a redevelopment. And we do A/B testing there on a regular basis. And we did not feel in the results that we're seeing on the ground that it made sense to bring redevelopment back in Houston or Orlando at this time. We'll monitor those, and those are markets we feel good about long term. But one of the nice things about the redevelopment project, the way we do it is we can be relatively nimble in response to on-the-ground market conditions and just it made sense to pause those in those markets. \nH. Bolton: And Amanda, we are looking at our '21 plans at the moment, and we'd expect to see another productive year on redevelopment. And then also, we've got a number of more extensive repositioning efforts in projects that we will likely kick off next year as well. \nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick clarification on some of your earlier migration comments. Are you still seeing movements from outside the Sunbelt remain in kind of that 8% to 10% historical range you've talked about? Or is it now running ahead of that with the growth you're talking about? \nThomas L. Grimes: It's about 11% or 12%, now. \nOperator: We will take our question from Anderson with SMBC. \nRichard Anderson: Tom, I want to not get too nitty-gritty here, but for the October move-ins up 4.8% on renewals and those that were signed up 5.8%. That's basically the foreshadow you're talking about in terms of renewals going up. I assume as we kind of venture into the fourth quarter here, but is that 100 basis point spread move in versus signed a typical spread? Or is it particularly higher or low right now versus other years? \nThomas L. Grimes: No, it's particularly hot right now. Usually, there's not much spread at all because our renewals are pretty consistent. But because renewals came down in the -- in terms of what our renewal offers were came down in June and July, those that then moved in 60 days out are lower. And then as our markets sort of stabilized and the picture became clearer on the impact of the economy in our market and we were seeing people stay and felt like we had pricing power then we began to move back to more of our normal practice. So normally, there's a pretty tight delta between those 2 numbers. But we're just on the incline at this point. And I would think as we stabilize, then you'll begin to see that delta tighten, but the overall renewal rates will be at a pretty high level at that point. \nRichard Anderson: Right. Okay. Right. I guess I was getting signed confused with offers. But -- okay. That makes sense. And then the second question, maybe big picture for Eric. Talking a lot about urban versus urban, but I bet your urban portfolio is doing better than northern cities or coastal cities. Maybe that's an obvious statement. And I'm wondering if you think, is this a red state, blue state thing? I mean, not to get political because that's not the intention. But do your typical residents have perhaps a far less sensitivity factor when it comes to COVID-19. And so they're more inclined to move around and do what they have to do to get into other apartment? Or is that hard to sort of gauge and so you don't really know? My guess is you're in Trump country there that, that would be the case. But again, not a political conversation, but I'm wondering just how people think about this kind of stuff and if it's playing a role in your business? \nH. Bolton: Well, Rich, there are 2 questions there. One is, you're right, we are not seeing nearly the pressure on our urban product that you're seeing on urban product in San Francisco and New York. Our turnover move-outs from our urban locations are down this year versus last year. So where we see pressure on urban performance more as a function of supply coming into the market because more often than not, at the moment, that supply is higher in price point and more urban oriented. \n But, yes, our urban product is holding up relatively pretty well. The other part of your question is, as you suggest, is really difficult to answer. I think that largely, what we are seeing benefit of is a --states, in cities in a broad region that just tends to be viewed as more, if you will, pro-business bringing -- employers are bringing jobs to this region of the country. Employers are bringing and relocating jobs out of some of these higher cost areas of the country. This is clearly a more affordable region in the country to live in, a more moderate weather challenges and just -- I think it has a lot of appeal. \n And I think that the behaviors that -- I mean, we're seeing these markets starting to open up perhaps a little quicker and in a robust -- more robust way that we see -- have seen take place in other regions of the country. And I don't know whether that's sort of a red/blue thing or whether it's just more a different mindset that's hard to really attribute to political issues or anything of that nature. I just think that it is what it is. And these cities and these states are going to be much more inclined to just move forward with business in this environment. And we're seeing some benefit of that. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. \nJonathan Petersen: Curious if you're seeing any new capital coming to your markets in terms of competition for acquisitions or funding new developments? Just thinking, you're hearing from a lot of private guys that have basically shunned office and retail and coastal apartments, but obviously, fundamentals are doing well in your markets. Just curious if you've seen any change in kind of new capital that's chasing your property type in your geographies? \nBrad Hill: Jon, this is Brad. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of capital in our market. Everybody that was interested in multifamily certainly is still interested in multifamily. And certainly, in the third quarter, we've seen of the folks that have been on the sidelines is kind of come back into the market and start looking for acquisitions, which -- that's one of the things that's driving and impacting pricing is there's just not a lot of deals and a lot of capital looking for it. \n I'd say one thing that we have seen that's changed and has been more pronounced is a number of investors that generally have targeted the Northeast have come into our market. And I think the way they look at some of our assets on a price per pound basis is a little bit different than what traditional Southeast investors do. And I think that, that is also driving pricing a bit, but we've seen a lot more participation from Northeast investors in our markets. And that's really the only change that we've seen. I think international capital is down a bit in our markets, but that's more than made up for by other capital sources. And then I'd say that private REITs are certainly very strong. They had a few months of low capital raising, which that's back up. And so those folks are back aggressively in the market. So\u2026 \nOperator: Next is Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. \nZachary Silverberg: So my first one is about some comments you made earlier on Salt Lake City. I'm just curious what other markets you consider entering? And would your plan be to enter in some sort of scale or via opportunistic one-offs? And what do IRRs and cap rates look like versus your core markets? \nThomas L. Grimes: No. I mean, Salt Lake is the only market that -- new market that we have intentionally targeted, and we have been working on that opportunity for some time. We've liked that market for quite some time. It's a -- the market has some challenges to get into, but we think we've got a way to get there, and we actually got, hopefully, several other opportunities behind the one we're currently working that would enable us over time to scale up there in a sufficient fashion. But we see the sort of underwriting dynamics and pricing there, very similar to how we see a number of our other Sunbelt markets and a lot of buyer interest. That's a market that continues to track just a great job growth, great quality of life, very affordable, employers like that a lot so we really like the long-term dynamics there. And it's just -- we've been disciplined about looking for the right way to get there and get into the market. And we've got a prepurchase opportunity that Brad and his team have been working on and hopefully, more to follow. \nZachary Silverberg: Got it. Appreciate that. And just one more from me. You sort of touched upon this in the prepared remarks in the press release that you worked with residents to stay in their homes. Can you quantify the amount of tenants to request the assistance? And how has that trended since the start of pandemic? And where does that sort of show up in your financials? \nAlbert M. Campbell: Yes. So the -- I mean, it shows up in the financials on the amount of rent outstanding. But we started with -- in April, we had 5,600 people on a rental assistance plan; in May, we had 5,100; in June, it was down to 2,000; July 529, and then we've stayed below 500 through October. So it's continued to remain steady and trend down, and the results of that are in our numbers. So those are what we've really found. We took some risk with working with these folks, but even for a jaded landlord, it's been impressive to see how well those folks have lived up to their obligation. We gave them a little bit of time, and they've come through very strong, and they've paid us. \nZachary Silverberg: Got you. And just one quick follow-up on Salt Lake. Could you provide any sort of cap rate or IRR color if you guys have that at your disposal? \nAlbert M. Campbell: What I'd tell you, we're still in our predevelopment work on that and more to come on that as we get that buttoned up and which we hope to do early next year. \nOperator: There appears to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Argo for any addition or closing remarks. \nTim Argo: Thank you, Ashley. I appreciate everybody joining us on the call, and please reach out if you have any more questions. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you and this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "H. Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Results for the third quarter were ahead of our expectations. Cash collections on rents build in the third quarter were strong and October trends are the same. While we still have a long way to go in capturing full economic recovery, we are encouraged by the early signs of improvement evident in our third quarter results. Leasing traffic was well ahead of prior year. On a lease-over-lease basis, new move in rent pricing meaningfully improved as compared to the second quarter. \n Overall, net effective rents were 1.8% higher than Q3 of last year and average daily occupancy remained strong at 95.6%. As a result, we captured positive sequential revenue growth in each of our markets as compared to the second quarter. Demand is strong across our footprint and growing. While we expect new supply levels to remain elevated for the next few quarters, forecast for new deliveries and the trends for permits for new construction suggest moderation in deliveries beginning in the back half of next year and significantly declining into 2022. \n We continue to make progress on our new development pipeline with construction and scheduled deliveries on track to our performance where we are underway with initial leasing, both our leasing trajectory and rents are in line with our expectations. We are in active predevelopment work on several other new development projects that we hope to start next year. We believe MAA's strategy, with a focus on the Sunbelt region uniquely diversified across both large and mid-tier markets and serving a broad segment of the rental market. \n As the company well positioned to continue to work through the challenges presented by the current economic slowdown. As the economy begins to recover post COVID, we believe our markets will continue to outperform, capturing employment trends and a demand for housing that will be well above national averages. \n MAA is well positioned for a coming recovery cycle. To our team of MAA associates, thank you for your tremendous work and commitment to our mission over the busy summer leasing season. You have again exceeded expectations, and as a result, have us well positioned as we head into next year. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. And Austin, this is Eric. I'll add to what Brad is saying that we've got repurchase opportunities or predevelopment opportunities, I'll say, that we're working, including both in-house and on the prepurchase platform that Brad mentioned. We're working opportunities that we have tied up in Tampa, Raleigh, Denver, Phoenix. we're also actually looking at opportunity in a new market for us of Salt Lake City, which we hope we can start on next year. So we've got a number of things we're looking at. Yes. And I would add, Nick, that I think people are probably a little -- residents are a little bit more sticky right now than perhaps they've ever been just as a consequence of COVID and the challenges of moving have always been there, but with COVID on the landscape, I think it probably helps in that regard as well. So we continue to feel that now is the time to -- as Tom says, if we're doing a great job on service, which I know we are at our locations, it makes sense to continue to push that to the extent that we monitor how much move out we're creating as a consequence of that and ready to back off and if we need to. But at this point, no signs that we need to do that. And Amanda, we are looking at our '21 plans at the moment, and we'd expect to see another productive year on redevelopment. And then also, we've got a number of more extensive repositioning efforts in projects that we will likely kick off next year as well. Well, Rich, there are 2 questions there. One is, you're right, we are not seeing nearly the pressure on our urban product that you're seeing on urban product in San Francisco and New York.

            "name": "Albert M. Campbell",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO of $1.57 per share for the quarter, which was slightly better than our internal expectations as operating performance, corporate overhead costs and interest costs were all better-than-expected for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, stable occupancy, strong builds in effective rents and continued strong collection supported the third quarter performance, while improving pricing trends position the portfolio well for the fourth quarter. \n As Tom mentioned -- excuse me, we have established a reserve for bad debts at quarter end sufficient to fully cover uncollected rent from rests not working with us on payment plans as well as for a large portion of the remaining deferral program payments. Our collections experience for those have been very good today. \n As discussed in our release last quarter, we expected some pressure in property operating expenses over the back half of the year. The majority of the increase for the third quarter was related to growth in real estate taxes, insurance and marketing costs as well as impact on a utility costs on the double-play bulk Internet program, all discussed last quarter. \n A couple of unusual items affecting the quarter were an unexpected increase in Austin tax rates related to a recent approval by the city to bring forward funding for a light rail system, which was approved during the quarter and actually goes before voters next week. In addition, we did occur about $750,000 of unexpected storm cleanup costs during the third quarter, which also contributed to the growth. \n Our balance sheet remains strong, with low leverage and significant capacity from cash and remaining borrowing potential under our line of credit, combining for $980 million of capacity. We funded $50 million of development costs during the quarter with the expectation of funding around $260 million for the full year, including the purchase of land parcels for future deals. \n As Brad mentioned, the acquisition environment remains challenging, so we expect the majority of investment opportunities over the next few quarters to be in-house development or pre purchase development deals, which both have long-term funding commitments. And thus, we expect our development pipeline to increase over the next few quarters, but remain well within the risk tolerance ranges we've always had. \n We completed a successful bond deal early in the quarter, taking advantage of the low rate environment to issue $450 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.7%. This funding was ultimately used to repay some secured debt maturing later this year as well as prepay a $300 million term loan during in 2022. We have no remaining current maturities or future maturities with low prepayment costs, so we don't anticipate additional debt or equity funding needs for the remainder of this year. \n And finally, as reflected in our release, recent trends have been encouraging, there's still significant uncertainties remaining, thus, we refrained from providing guidance for the remainder of the year, but plan to revisit the decision as we prepare for our fourth quarter release with the expectation of being able to provide guidance for 2021. \n That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call over to you for questions. Yes, John, I appreciate that question. I think as we look at whether there's continuation of certain government programs, the recent potential rise in COVID cases in our region, timing of reopening plans that continue in our region related to these states. And so all these things continue to bring risk. And as we mentioned, I mean, we are very encouraged with the trends, but just given that it was 1 quarter remaining in the year, we felt it prudent to refrain completing that out right now. We hope to be and feel like we'll be in a position, assuming continued stability in overall marketplace and environment to put full guidance out for 2021. I don't want to change. I mean, we continue to underwrite in a similar manner. I think what it does is it certainly provides the potential for very strong yields, gaps and the spread capture on some of these new development deals that brand, whether they're in-house development or prepurchase. And so that's why we talked about the remaining -- the capacity we have. And also, we talked about in the past, John, that we have a potential on our balance sheet to invest in $750 million before really impacting our leverage level. \n So I think we would say that -- and I talked about in the comments this morning, we do expect over the next couple of quarters on development pipeline to grow because that's where the opportunity is. And as you point out, those 6 yields that we're putting in place compared to that [ 1 to 7 ] debt funding cost is very attractive. Well, I think that if you look at our portfolio, I think that it really is -- it starts with the overall Sunbelt footprint, obviously, but where we are seeing stronger performance occur is particularly in some of our mid-tier markets where the supply pressures at the moment are not quite as significant. So some of our mid-Tier component of our strategy, mid-tier market component of our footprint is certainly helpful at this point. And then if you look at a submarket level, we have a higher percent of our portfolio is suburban in non-urban core. And that orientation of the portfolio, I think, is also a big contributor to our ability to sort of weather these downturns in a better fashion. Certainly a topical conversation right now. I wouldn't say that there's informal areas that where we're seeing right now that would be the next one to be a significant increase. Certainly going into the year, Nashville and Austin, both unexpected and were significant increases. And some question that a lot of municipalities are dealing with budget issues now. And so we're certainly watching that and monitoring. I think it's not just us in our region, it's nationwide in many markets. I would say this year, you're not seeing valuation relief yet because people are looking backwards. Maybe as we move into next year, you get a little bit of valuation relief and then the millage rates they're still in question because of all these issues that the municipalities are dealing with. So we're watching that closely, John. That's a long answer to say nothing specific, but certainly top of mind right now. I think what I was trying to indicate was we've talked about a range of tolerance we would have for our pipeline overall, given our balance sheet. And typically, we've said 4% or 5% of our balance sheet, of course, an $18 billion balance sheet, that's a significant number. And so I think we would see -- we're certainly -- I made the comment because the opportunities that Brad mentioned, will be there in the development pre purchase as well as in house. The yields are very good relative to financing costs. We'll certainly see that increase. And we have room in our balance sheet to use that for a while to fund those maintaining -- I put the range out there. Over the long term, we certainly want to protect and maintain our balance sheet ratios where they are. So 4% to 5%, that gives you $800 million or so, a little more we could work with. And in the long term, we'll probably see that come back down into where we are now over a long period of time. Yes. So the -- I mean, it shows up in the financials on the amount of rent outstanding. But we started with -- in April, we had 5,600 people on a rental assistance plan; in May, we had 5,100; in June, it was down to 2,000; July 529, and then we've stayed below 500 through October. So it's continued to remain steady and trend down, and the results of that are in our numbers. So those are what we've really found. We took some risk with working with these folks, but even for a jaded landlord, it's been impressive to see how well those folks have lived up to their obligation. We gave them a little bit of time, and they've come through very strong, and they've paid us. What I'd tell you, we're still in our predevelopment work on that and more to come on that as we get that buttoned up and which we hope to do early next year."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through a busy season. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 11%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.4% in the second quarter to 95.6% in the third quarter. \n In addition to strengthening occupancy by 20 basis points, we were also able to drive new lease pricing improvement. Effective new lease pricing during the quarter improved 140 basis points from the second quarter to the third. All in-place rents on a year-over-year basis were up 1.8%, and turnover for the quarter was down 2.7% versus last year. \n These improvements were supported by an increase in lead-generating marketing spending. We're pleased with the resulting improvements in occupancy and new lease pricing mentioned earlier. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the second quarter, we restarted our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package. That includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. \n Year-to-date, we have installed 22,000 smart home packages and completed 3,300 interior unit upgrades. As noticed in the supplemental document collections during the quarter were strong. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistants dropped with each month. In April, we had 5,600 residents on the relief plans. The number of participants decreased over time and it's just 470 for the October rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. \n October collections are running slightly ahead of the good results we saw in the third quarter. As of October 26, we've collected 98.6% of rent build for October. This is a 20 basis point improvement from what we saw on average for July, August and September for the same-day of the month, including deferred payments for COVID-19 effective resident payment plans referenced in the COVID-19 disclosure, we have accounted for 98.8% of October build rent. \n Leasing volume for October is on track to exceed last year. Effective new lease pricing for October-to-date is negative 2%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter, effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for October month-to-date is 1.3%, a 50 basis point improvement from the third quarter. A high percentage of our current residents are choosing to stay with us, and our resident renewal and retention trends are positive. October, November and December lease-over-lease renewal rates signed at this time are in the 4.5% to 5.5% range. \n In addition to the positive leasing trends, occupancy has also strengthened. Occupancy has improved from a low point of 95.1% in May to 95.7% today. Average daily occupancy for the month is 95.6%, which is even with October of last year. 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, has dropped from a high of 9.2% in May to 6.8% in October. This low level of exposure also matches the same time last year and has us well positioned for the slower winter leasing season. \n I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They served and cared for our residents and our associates well and have grappled with the constantly changing implications COVID-19. They've also worked diligently to adapt to new business conditions and drive our recovery. I'm proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. Brad? Yes. Nick, it's Tom. I think what we've enjoyed thus far, frankly, is pricing that has been unseasonal as you mentioned, normally our effect of new lease pricing peaks late July. Thus far, its peaked late August -- or excuse me, late October, with steady trends as it goes. I would expect, as we move into the fourth quarter, that we would see a seasonal falloff in sort of demand as we usually do and that new lease pricing will drop modestly, and that we'll be able to hold on or in the range of our current level of occupancy. That said, what I think will continue to grow, which are renewal rates that were effective in the third quarter or just 3.8. I think we'll see renewal rates continue to improve as we move through the fourth quarter. That's not something that's usual that seasonal, and that we'll see those in the 4.5% to 5.5% range for the fourth quarter. I'm sorry, Nick, I missed which market you were asking about? Yes, absolutely. Yes, D.C. is a little bit different. Honestly, occupancy there is strong at 96.4%. The pricing has been weak. And as we go around the horn, we're seeing concession levels in D.C. Proper at 2 months unstabilized; Pentagon City, Crystal City, about 2 months; Tyson's corner, 2 months; Alexandria, pretty similar; Maryland and Northern Virginia are a little bit stronger, but both seeing a month 3 in those markets. So D.C. is 1 where we're stable on occupancy, but pricing growth remains elusive at the moment. Sure, Neil. We've seen -- we didn't see much of that in the second quarter, but it's picked up in the third quarter. And most of the -- majority of our move-ins come from within the Sunbelt. So keep in mind that these numbers that I'm going to throw at you represent a relatively low percentage of our total move-ins. But they are growing. So New York -- move-ins from New York is up double digits; moving from Massachusetts are up about 9.2%; Pennsylvania 10%; and California, almost 8%. And then sort of anecdotally, we spend a good amount of time digging into the Google Analytics stuff. We're also seeing searches from those areas. For instance, like if you pick a search phrase like apartments in Atlanta, that's up 44% over prior year from addresses in the New York area. Apartments in Raleigh is up 22% from our searches in the Massachusetts area. So it's not a driver of our business at this point, but there's certainly evidence to suggest that this is a continuing trend. Yes. On new home buying, that's remained relatively flat at 19.5% of our move-outs. So that has been steady as it goes. And then move out to single-family rentals have stayed well below 6%. Certainly, those are -- those businesses are doing well out there, but we're not seeing them drive an increase in turnover at this point. And we think people are with our demographic, which is in majority female, single and not at the phase where they're making those changes. We are not -- we're just not seeing a ton of shift in that direction in our move-outs. It's roughly 100%. I mean we don't -- I'd say roughly just because I hadn't checked the number in the last couple of days, but that is -- we -- that's not a survey that's sent after the fact. That is a -- when you offer a notice to us, that's a required field for them to fill out and capture. So it is -- that's where we're getting that information. It is a part of our transaction for accepting the notice. Pretty confident in and just to reset a little bit, in Q3, the renewals came down to 3.8%. And now we're seeing them move back in the 4.5% and 5%. Honestly, our 2 to 3-year average, there's probably 6%. So we're still a little below that. We feel quite confident in our ability to continue to maintain those rates as long as we continue to do our job and create value for our residents. We feel like renewals is a place where we have the most pricing power, and that hasn't changed through this process. So we feel confident in our ability to continue that. I think in terms of looking forward on that, we're in the process of really going through our study, Fred's team does an unbelievable job. They're really diving into the markets and understanding and what the implications are for us for 2021. So we're doing our study of the market. We're doing our study of the radius of our market exactly how it affects us. And we'll have more on that in the fourth quarter. But what we are showing really is a falloff in supply in the back half of year for a range of reasons that were mentioned earlier. I'm sorry, we didn't understand that. Yes. So we're actually doing those on turns and occupied and really, the majority, we just got back on it in the third quarter, and most of those units got completed a late third quarter. So when we have -- we do not -- when we do it on an occupied unit, we do not immediately put that price increase on it resets at the renewal. And then on new leases, we rent them with it. And that is a bump, but it is not a material bump in the third quarter, a lease-over-lease new lease numbers. Yes. Consistently, across the board, I mean you've touched on urban is -- our suburbans running a little stronger than urban. And then also a or higher price point is running a little weaker than B. B is strong. So B suburban is the best, and that plays out whether you're in the suburban or in the urban areas. On the unit types, it is -- we're majority 1 in 2 bedrooms. And in terms of our current exposure level and the current lease level growth for 1s and 2s, they're incredibly consistent. 1s are slightly ahead of 2, but it's by a negligible amount. The floor plan that is a little less popular right now is our efficiencies. They are running closer to 95% occupied on an average basis with more like 8% exposure and not terribly surprising. But to put that in perspective, that efficiencies are 4% of our exposure and 1s and 2s are like 88%. So the one little less favorable floor plan that we have right now is just 4% exposure. I think that's honestly skewed a little bit by the A/B because our B assets and suburban assets tend to be a little bit larger. So if we looked at the numbers, yes, that would be the case. But I think that has to do with more the construction type and just sort of differences between our B product and our suburban product versus our A product and our urban product. Not a dramatic falloff. I think Houston and D.C., we're watching carefully as well as Orlando. But those are more sort of like bumping along than falling off materially. No. I mean, double play is really spread across the portfolio by tight fairly evenly. So no, there is not -- it is not that Double Play is not adversely or positively affecting one market or the other on the revenue or expense on. No. I mean I think it's just a difference in timing and seasonality. So from -- on an effective basis or when new lease rates that moved in, in October, they're actually up sequentially. New leases if you're looking at the new leases if you're looking at the supplemental or down slightly, which is what I mentioned earlier, I think we'll see normal seasonal trends on pricing as we head into November, December. The odd thing is, is that new lease pricing climbed, honestly, from May to October. And usually, it peaks in July for effective. And then the other thing that will be different for us in the fourth quarter in terms of pricing is that you're going to see renewal rates move back up into the 4.5% and 5% range, whereas normally, they might be coming down from 7% to 6% or 5.5% in a normal seasonal pattern. Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Amanda. And yes, there is some difference. We brought back about 80% of our units. And 80% of the properties where we're doing a redevelopment. And we do A/B testing there on a regular basis. And we did not feel in the results that we're seeing on the ground that it made sense to bring redevelopment back in Houston or Orlando at this time. We'll monitor those, and those are markets we feel good about long term. But one of the nice things about the redevelopment project, the way we do it is we can be relatively nimble in response to on-the-ground market conditions and just it made sense to pause those in those markets. It's about 11% or 12%, now. No, it's particularly hot right now. Usually, there's not much spread at all because our renewals are pretty consistent. But because renewals came down in the -- in terms of what our renewal offers were came down in June and July, those that then moved in 60 days out are lower. And then as our markets sort of stabilized and the picture became clearer on the impact of the economy in our market and we were seeing people stay and felt like we had pricing power then we began to move back to more of our normal practice. So normally, there's a pretty tight delta between those 2 numbers. But we're just on the incline at this point. And I would think as we stabilize, then you'll begin to see that delta tighten, but the overall renewal rates will be at a pretty high level at that point. No. I mean, Salt Lake is the only market that -- new market that we have intentionally targeted, and we have been working on that opportunity for some time. We've liked that market for quite some time. It's a -- the market has some challenges to get into, but we think we've got a way to get there, and we actually got, hopefully, several other opportunities behind the one we're currently working that would enable us over time to scale up there in a sufficient fashion. But we see the sort of underwriting dynamics and pricing there, very similar to how we see a number of our other Sunbelt markets and a lot of buyer interest. That's a market that continues to track just a great job growth, great quality of life, very affordable, employers like that a lot so we really like the long-term dynamics there. And it's just -- we've been disciplined about looking for the right way to get there and get into the market. And we've got a prepurchase opportunity that Brad and his team have been working on and hopefully, more to follow."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter transaction volume picked up from second quarter, but still remains down significantly year-over-year, and we expect the volume to continue to be slow into next year. Because of the desirability of our markets, we continue to see robust buyer demand for existing assets within our footprint. This strong demand, coupled with very attractive debt rates, has further compressed cap rates, and in some cases, is resulting in pricing above pre-COVID levels, despite lower NOI's. We continue to expect our best buying opportunities on existing assets to be owned properties and their initial lease-up, where we believe pressure is likely to continue to build through the winter. \n With that said, we've only seen a few lease-up opportunities come up and pricing trends are mixed. All cash buyers and strong sponsors with established agency relationships remain the most aggressive bidders, while leverage buyers are having more difficulty obtaining financing on prestabilized properties. We do expect cap rates within our footprint to remain at historical lows and perhaps continue to trend lower, likely making acquisitions a smaller contributor to our external growth for some time. \n As mentioned last quarter, we expect our in-house development and our prepurchase platform to be significant contributors to our external growth going forward and anticipate starting construction on a number of these projects later this year and into next. While cap rates on acquisitions have compressed, yields on developments remain attractive. Rents and occupancy are holding up in our markets and despite cost pressure in a couple of line items, especially lumber, developments continue to underwrite to a positive spread to cap rates on stabilized properties. \n As shown in our supplemental, we have 6 development projects that are underway and all remain on budget and on-time, despite working through some minor supply chain issues. Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on the land parcel in the northern suburb of Austin that we purchased back in January. This 350 unit project should begin leasing in the first half of 2022, when we expect leasing conditions to be significantly stronger than they are today. \n While early reports show 2021 deliveries in line with this year's levels, data and permitting and construction starts show a material decline since March and point to a drop in future deliveries beginning late next year and into 2022, lining up well with the expected delivery of any new development we start. \n That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Al. Austin, this is Brad. I think certainly, in terms of construction costs, we've seen a strong rise in lumber, but it's been pretty volatile. We've seen a strong run-up since COVID. We have seen some relief there in the last 30 days or so, but it's still a pretty big unknown in terms of our construction cost. And we're really not seeing any other line items at the moment that are providing relief or offsetting some of that. It's just not happening. At the moment, in terms of seeing our -- not seeing construction tick up based on the permitting data we're seeing, I think it's -- I think financing is certainly a big part of that. When we started out of COVID equity was a little nervous. And so second quarter was tough. Equity folks backed out of a number of development deals. That's kind of -- since it's come back. \n And now I think the difficulty is more on the construction side or getting construction loans, that's very, very difficult for folks at the moment. And I think that's giving us some additional opportunities on our prepurchase platform, just based on the way we've structured that. But I think fundamentally, our markets continue to underwrite well for new development. You've got the -- certainly, the construction cost pressure a bit, but we see some mitigating circumstances there being the lower supply that we're talking about at late 2021 and into 2022 that the permitting data is showing. So we feel good about anything that we are developing today and putting a shovel on the ground on today. But I think the financing environment for folks -- for a number of folks out there is a little bit more difficult. Perhaps. I mean, in terms of the -- what we're seeing on the prepurchase side, I mean, again, we're evaluating a lot of deals. As equity-backed out in the second quarter, we had a lot come forward to us. And then as I said, we've got our ability to provide the debt on our prepurchase platform is kind of a differentiator for us. And for folks that -- a lot of the established developers that we're doing business with, they have the capacity and the ability to go out and get debt, but we just provide a better option for them. So we're seeing a lot of opportunities there. We've got 2 that we hope to start in the coming quarters and in others that are in daily for us to evaluate. So we're optimistic that, that platform continues to perform and to provide opportunities for us. Well, this is Brad. I think in terms of the shadow development, I don't think we're seeing a lot of that in our markets at the moment. I think what we certainly see is the repurposing of retail spaces into apartments, but the retail getting torn down. I think we're doing that at our West property in Denver, where we're tearing down an older underutilized retail space to put in apartments. I think we'll see some of that. But I don't know that we're going to see -- we're certainly not seeing right now repurposing of hotels or anything like that within our markets at the moment. But in terms of supply that we're seeing increases in, let me get my reply... Jon, this is Brad. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of capital in our market. Everybody that was interested in multifamily certainly is still interested in multifamily. And certainly, in the third quarter, we've seen of the folks that have been on the sidelines is kind of come back into the market and start looking for acquisitions, which -- that's one of the things that's driving and impacting pricing is there's just not a lot of deals and a lot of capital looking for it. \n I'd say one thing that we have seen that's changed and has been more pronounced is a number of investors that generally have targeted the Northeast have come into our market. And I think the way they look at some of our assets on a price per pound basis is a little bit different than what traditional Southeast investors do. And I think that, that is also driving pricing a bit, but we've seen a lot more participation from Northeast investors in our markets. And that's really the only change that we've seen. I think international capital is down a bit in our markets, but that's more than made up for by other capital sources. And then I'd say that private REITs are certainly very strong. They had a few months of low capital raising, which that's back up. And so those folks are back aggressively in the market. So..."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 30, 2020. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA.\nTim Argo: Thank you Ashley and good morning everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel, Tom Grimes, our COO and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks Tim. Results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as strong collections drove NOI performance above our internal forecast. Due to both the high quality of our portfolio and the proactive efforts by our team to work with residents impacted by the pandemic, we expect continued solid performance with collections. Encouragingly, the trends for rent payments improved over the course of the quarter. And as Tom will touch on, the positive trends continued in July, with fewer residents seeking rent deferral arrangements. As of the 27th of the month, our cash collections for July rent were a strong 98.1% which compares favorably to an average Q2 performance on a comparable basis at 96.4%. We are monitoring reports of increased levels of COVID cases in a number of Sunbelt markets. While we expect conditions will remain fluid and choppy across various states and markets, we are optimistic that efforts to reopen local businesses and economies will continue. Beyond the uncertainties associated with how various state and local economies will proceed to reopen, questions associated with actions by the federal government to extend support to individuals and businesses also remain unresolved. For these reasons, we continue to feel that conditions remain too uncertain to provide updated earnings guidance. However, as outlined in our supplemental pages to the press release, we will continue to provide more details surrounding current rent collections and leasing trends. Assuming there is no significant change in current conditions, we believe that we will continue to capture solid collections on billed rent as well as continued low resident turnover and stable occupancy. We do expect continued pressure on rent growth, but we were encouraged with the improvement in lease-over-lease pricing for leases signed in July. With a significant percentage of our leases re-pricing during the busy summer leasing season, it is important to keep in mind that we will carry these re-priced units into early leasing season next year and it will weigh on the cumulative performance of overall rent growth for the next three quarters or so. However, as new supply deliveries slow next year, we expect a resumption of more robust rent growth across our markets. Longer term, we believe that our Sunbelt markets will capture increasingly stronger trends in adding new employers, job growth and new household formations. Our unique approach to diversifying across this robust region of the country with high quality communities, supported by a sophisticated operating platform will, we believe, continue to drive long term outperformance for capital. Further, our strong balance sheet puts us in a solid position to both weather the current economic slowdown as well as opportunistically pursue compelling opportunities that emerge. In closing, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to our MAA associates for their dedication and superior service throughout the stressful second quarter. Your performance and commitment to our mission of serving our residents and all who depend on MAA, during these stressful times has been absolutely incredible. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Grimes: Thank you Eric and good morning everyone. I will offer a short recap on the second quarter and then move to trends that we have seen through July. The initial slowdown in demand triggered by COVID-19 in late March has moderated and trends are improving. Our teams have adapted and have been effective using our virtual self-tour platform. These practices were further augmented by our return to guided tours in May. Leasing volume in April was down versus prior year by 9% of volume and May and June were strong enough and leasing volume for the quarter was 0.6% higher than last year. Effective rents were up 3.4% and blended lease-over-lease pricing including concessions was up 1.2%. Occupancy remained steady at 95.4%. And turnover for the quarter was down 7% versus last year. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the quarter, we restarted our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. As noted in the supplemental document, collections during the quarter were strong, we worked diligently to identify and support those who needed help as a result of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped with each month. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants decreased each month thereafter and it's just 530 for the July rental assistance plan. This represents 0.5% of our 100,000 units. As a reminder, in addition to the flexible payment plans for those affected by COVID-19, we have not charged late fees, we have frozen eviction proceedings and actively worked to pair affected residents with local and national support resources. While we are still below our normal run rate, the reduction in the number of residents on a rental assistance planned aided our fee income during the second quarter. As of July 27, we have collected 98.1% of rent billed for July. This is a 170 basis points better than April, May and June results at the same day of the month. Adding the 0.3% of deferred payments for COVID-19 affected resident payment plans, referenced in the COVID-19 disclosure, we have accounted for 98.4% of July's billed rent. This is an encouraging result, but we are keeping a close eye on the CARES Act expiration and the discussion around the continuation of government benefits. Leasing volume for July is on track to exceed last year. Historically, pricing power peaks in the early third quarter and thus far July has been our best pricing month since COVID-19 hit. Net July month-to-date blended lease-over-lease rates signed during the month increased 1.7%. This is more than 100 basis points better than leases signed in the second quarter. While we see this improvement across asset types and locations, our B assets and our suburban locations are stronger. In addition to positive pricing trends, occupancy has also strengthened. Occupancy has improved from a low point of 95.1% to 95.7% today. Sixty day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, has dropped from a high of 9.2% in April to 8.4% in June and is now 8%. Our current residents are choosing to stay with us and our resident renewal retention rates were also positive. August, September and October renewal accept rates are running ahead of prior years and signed lease-over-lease rates are in the 4% to 5% range. I would like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They have served and cared for our residents and our associates well and have grappled with the constantly changing implications of COVID-19. They worked diligently to provide supportive and caring environments for our residents and one another. I am proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. I will now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you Tom. The transaction market continues to experience a material slowdown in activity, with second quarter volume within our markets down significantly from 2019. In addition to challenges in underwriting, travel moratoriums, property tour restrictions and difficulties performing due diligence, all continue to make closing a successful transaction challenging. Despite these pressures, sellers are beginning to test the waters and our number of underwritings, while still below previous years, have increased materially since the beginning of July. Certainty of execution is more important than ever and since this is one of our core strengths, we have been able to review a number of properties, mostly off market. At this point, most of the deals we have reviewed have not traded, so broad pricing trends are not yet apparent. The upcoming election is likely to further suppress transaction volume and cause the lack of pricing discovery to persist. We believe better buying opportunities on new lease-ups should emerge after the election and into 2021 as the backlog of merchant built properties, which are prevalent in our footprint, begin to hit the market. The availability of financing continues to evolve. While early in the pandemic debt financing was difficult across the board, it now remains difficult for lease-up properties as well as some developments, but it is available at very attractive rates for stabilized assets. In addition, the commitment of equity is also further restricting transaction volume and construction starts. To-date, a number of equity providers have paused or completely pulled out of quite a few new developments as well as acquisitions, sometimes for reasons not related to the real estate or the returns. This hesitancy coupled with our continued ability to perform on compelling investments has opened the door for us to review numerous opportunities through each of our external growth platforms. While we are reviewing a few acquisitions, it's still too early for new lease-up opportunities to materialize and more compelling investments on existing assets are likely to emerge late this year and into 2021. Our balance sheet is well-positioned to allow us to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. Our development team continues to pursue a number of land sites with three developments in due diligence that we hope to start construction on in 2021. With equity hesitating on new developments, we are receiving strong interest in our pre-purchase platform. We are currently in conversations on several opportunities that would likely start construction late this year or early next, with delivery occurring mid-2022 and wrapping up in 2023. These development and pre-purchase investments align well with the current delivery pipelines and will deliver at a time when we believe the leasing conditions for new developments will be significantly stronger. We are beginning to see a drop in permit activity and have seen a substantial drop in construction starts in our markets, which should result in a decrease in deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In terms of construction, the six projects we have under way remain on budget and on schedule. And to-date, we have not experienced any major disruptions or delays to any of our supply chains. With that, I will turn the call over to Al.\nAl Campbell: Thank you Brad and good morning everyone. I will provide some brief commentary on the company's recent earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. As mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the second quarter performance, particularly in the area of rent collections. At beginning of the pandemic, this area was the most significant short term unknown with rental pricing expected to have a longer term impact as new leases rolled through the portfolio. As noted in the supplement, through July 27, we either fully collected or obtained deferral agreements for 98.4% of all rent billed during the second quarter. And at this point, we have had very good payment performance from our deferral addendums with a 97% compliance rate on outstanding agreements. We also established a reserve sufficient to cover all rent unpaid from residents not entering a formal agreement as well as a large portion of the deferred rent. July continued the strong trend in rent collections, but given the remaining high level of uncertainty, we do not yet have enough clarity to reestablish earnings for overall same-store guidance for the year. However, we do have a little more clarity on operating expenses and overall, we still expect them to end up essentially in line with our initial forecast for the year. As a reminder, we initially outlined same-store expense growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.75% to 4.75% growth or 4.25% growth at the midpoint. The primary pressure is coming from real estate taxes, insurance and the roll out of the bulk Internet cable program called Double Play. The context and the contribution to expense growth, ignoring these three items, all other operating expenses are expected to grow about 2.5% for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to support our business plans very well with leverage near historic lows and significant capacity from cash and remaining borrow potential under our line of credit combining for $927 million of capacity. We restarted our redevelopment programs during the quarter and our development pipeline continues to progress well and on track. We expect to fund between $200 million and $250 million balance for the full year toward the completion of our development pipeline. As Brad mentioned, the acquisition environment remains challenging with most opportunities expected to be pre-purchase deals, which will have longer term funding commitments similar to a development. We currently expect our business plans for the remainder of the year to be essentially leverage neutral not requiring any equity funding this year. However, as previously discussed, our plans do include a potential bond deal in the second half of the year to fully pay off our line of credit, maintaining our capacity and prepaying some future debt maturities in today's low rate environment. And finally, as reflected in our release, we incurred $2.4 million of COVID-19 related expenses during the second quarter, primarily consisting of additional cleaning supplies, COVID-19 related leave and contract labor. We added these costs back to core FFO as these initial expenses are considered non-recurring in nature. We do expect remaining costs to be much smaller over the second half of the year. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.\nNeil Malkin: Hi everyone. Good morning.\nEric Bolton: Hi Neil. Good morning Neil.\nNeil Malkin: Nice quarter. First question. Have you started to see, maybe over the last three months in terms of your new leases, migration out of the gateway urban markets and into your sort of core Sunbelt names? Or is that kind of either too hard or too soon to discern?\nEric Bolton: No. We track that information. Overall, it's a relatively low percentage of our total leases. We didn't see much movement in the second quarter. But in July that began to tick up. So New York is up double-digits, Massachusetts up about 8.7% and Pennsylvania up about 5.3% of our increase over prior year on that. But again, still relatively low percentage of our total leases, but we are beginning to see early trends in that.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that. Are you seeing, within your markets, more move from urban to suburban particularly in some of your, I guess, maybe out of your post assets or things like that into more suburban areas?\nEric Bolton: We are not seeing that. We are seeing demand for urban assets. Suburban assets is a stronger pricing for us right now. But we are not seeing people transfer from urban to suburban.\nNeil Malkin: Got it. And then maybe can you just talk about Orlando? How that market has been performing and how it's trending? Similar with Charleston and Savannah and in some of your markets that are more exposed to leisure travel?\nEric Bolton: Yes. Orlando is, I would say, improved on the rent collection standpoint. They were one of our larger exposures back in April. They are now just 0.7% of leases outstanding or on renewal or on rent support programs. In terms of the market, Disney and Universal coming back in modest fashion have helped a little bit. We are seeing the more Northern properties perform better than the Southern properties, which have that exposure to Disney and a little bit of International. So it's sort of, I would say, largely the same with some improving rent collection trends right now. But we are pleased to see the parks open and that has a ripple effect across those Southern properties. And then Charleston frankly improved significantly. We saw a nice pickup in late second quarter and early July. I mean Savannah is still worry bead on that front.\nNeil Malkin: Great. And then last one from me. In terms of opportunities, you mentioned, you kind of talked about a lot, I am not sure I got all of it correctly. But you do not think that in the second half of the year, you are going to see stabilized opportunities. It's mostly just the development related deals. And then also, are you thinking or what do you think about doing some mezz or preferred given the kind of dislocation relative to earlier in the year and the higher yields you could get?\nBrad Hill: Neil, this is Brad. I think in terms of the opportunities for the rest of the year, I do think there will be, we have seen starting in July some stabilized assets have begin to come to market. Certainly in the second quarter, there was just a complete fall off and transactions coming to market. That's picked up a bit. I think for us, our focus has always been on new lease-ups. And to-date we are not really seeing those come to market. I think there needs to be a little bit more pressure in the market before developers begin to really bring those to market. So we are really focused in seeing opportunities right now based on kind of the capital constraints that I mentioned in my opening comments. We are seeing the opportunities really emerge on the development front, land sites that have been dropped and then also on pre-purchase where we partner with developers. And for those, we have got difficulties in both debt and equity on that side that's putting some opportunities in front of us that we wouldn't have had.\nEric Bolton: Neil, this is Eric. Also just to clarify, we are not in the business of financing other people's properties. We will come in with capital and work with developers on the basis that we will ultimately own the asset. But functioning strictly as a financier of other people's product is not what we do.\nNeil Malkin: Got it. Thank you guys very much.\nTom Grimes: Thanks Neil.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nSumit Sharma: Hi guys. This is Sumit, in for Nick. Good thoughts about renewals. Just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about this. They were lower in July, but still well above peers at 4.8%. And just to make sure these leases were offered about 30 to 60 days earlier, right. So most likely right after reopening, how should we think about renewals looking ahead? I mean, is this close to the low in July? Or could they track new lease rates and perhaps stay flattish or slip a little further? Any color around that? Or what is your most sticky point in your negotiations with renewing tenants? And what's driving turnover so low would be really helpful?\nAl Campbell: Thank you. I think you caught it in your earlier comments. July was priced on the renewal front at the sort of peak concern level at this point or thus far. So we would expect at this point the renewal rates for July, that took place in July, to be the low point renewals. And in July we are 4.5%. And I think we expect September and October to be between 4% and 5% range going forward. So a little recovery in renewal rates is what we are expecting.\nSumit Sharma: And I guess, just following up, what's driving negotiations and turnover? Just any color on that kind of thing?\nEric Bolton: We have got a very sophisticated platform and team that works to understand what the market demand is for renewal. And we use that process consistently and have trusted it over the years. And that's what we used to move out. And then, we obviously have some level of negotiation with the resident at that point. There hadn't been much in the way of sticking points. So we sort of feel like we are hitting the right spot in terms of the market, because the accept rates are actually better than in prior years. So I would say, it's a pretty honestly normal renewal process going forward.\nSumit Sharma: Okay. That's really helpful color. And I guess what's, just to understand the overall pricing environment a little better and I will yield after that, we are hearing that there was a surge of pent-up demand right after the lockdowns. And so there were people who really wanted to sort of change living conditions and that's why they were looking to move even during the virtual leasing days. But now that everything is seemingly open again, we are also hearing that we are seeing a lot more bargain hunters implying rate pressure and competitive dynamics. So your views seem to suggest that you are not seeing that. I guess what's different here? Or what's driving your optimism a little more?\nEric Bolton: What I would tell you is that we did see, as you saw in my comments around the second quarter, we did see sort of a push back in leasing volumes in May and June which sort of caught us up from the fall off in April. But what we are seeing is sort of a normal seasonal trend at this point. And sort of pricing power, if you will, normally peaks in late July and early August. I would expect that to happen. And then of course, it will fall off in the fall under normal seasonal patterns. We are certainly seeing bargain hunters out there and our pricing is down lower than it was at this time last year. But what we are seeing is sort of normal seasonal pricing patterns now as we move past that sort of shutdown, if you will, that occurred in late March and early April.\nTom Grimes: The other thing I would add is that, I think the fact that you are seeing performance along the lines of what you are describing, you really have to start thinking about different parts of the country. And our Sunbelt markets have just continued to, we think, demonstrate a certain resiliency to them that is stronger than what we are seeing in other regions of the country. And as a consequence of that, things were depressed from where they were a year ago, but patterns and overall behavior in activity surrounding leasing and renewal is pretty much in line with patterns that we have seen historically.\nSumit Sharma: Thank you so much. That's really great color. I will yield now.\nTom Grimes: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. With COVID cases increasing kind of broadly across the Sunbelt, I am wondering on the ground if you see any correlation between local hotspots and the relative strength of the operating environment?\nBrad Hill: Nick, you were a little muffled. And we are all trying to talk through masks, I suspect. But I think you were asking correlation between hotspots and leasing volume. Is that correct?\nNick Joseph: That's right. Just on kind of the micro level, if you see a hotspot or if there is a hotspot for COVID, do you feel that on the ground, from a leasing perspective?\nTom Grimes: Nick, we have not seen much in the way of correlation on that. You know, the market fundamentals really seem to be driven more by where the layoffs are occurring and then some variability between location and the submarket. But we are not seeing leasing fall-off in, let's say, high positivity markets versus low positivity markets at this point, unless those correlate with unemployment levels.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just on that, do you have a sense of what percentage of your tenants are currently unemployed or benefiting from government support?\nTom Grimes: We do not have insight into their source of income, Nick. But the fact that we have seen such an improvement and in terms of the number of people asking support from us and the feedback that we get, when we interact with our assistant property managers and our property managers, which as you can imagine, we are doing a ton of right now is that the people getting off are not getting off the plans because their government check came in. They are getting off the plans because they got more hours or they got pulled back off of furlough or Disney opened and they are now engaged in some sort of support capacity.\nEric Bolton: And Nick, the other thing I would add is, when you look at the average income of our portfolio of our resident profile and our average rent at this point, rent constitutes about 20% of monthly income of our resident base, pretty affordable. And so as a consequence of that, while we are certainly monitoring what's happening with the efforts to continue some government assistance at the federal level for unemployment, we are not particularly concerned about that issue, because we just haven't, for all the reasons that Tom mentioned, we just feel like that our folks have not really depended a lot on that assistance to meet the rent obligations.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nTom Grimes: Thank you Nick.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks and good morning everyone. Eric or Tom, I am curious what you think is really driving the strong demand for your properties today, given the state of the job market, the fact that there is some strength in the single-family housing market, both for buy and rentals. And so do you think it's renters that are trading down and bargain hunting, as somebody referenced earlier? Just curious about your thoughts on what's driving demand today?\nTom Grimes: Yes. Austin, I appreciate the question. I think it really is the underlying outlay of our markets in our area of the country and what we are seeing is normal patterns. And I mean I appreciate the comment on strong demand. I am not sure I would quite classify that other than strong relative demand. But demand is clearly off of the levels that we were seeing last year. But I mean we like the resiliency that we are seeing. We are spread out across the Sunbelt, which is a place that is I think appealing, especially in this timeframe and was already a major driver for jobs. And then we have allocated across, we have got across different market types as well. So it is holding up well and the defensive nature of our portfolio I think is showing, but I would hold short before I called it strong demand, I would call relatively strong demand, which we are pleased with.\nEric Bolton: I would also add, Austin, when you consider the fact that 80% of our resident profile is single and only 20% married and over 50% female, this is not a demographic, this is going to be driven to move into single-family, be it for sale or for rent. So we just continue to not see any mounting evidence whatsoever that single-family is becoming more compelling as it pertains to drawing more of our traffic.\nTom Grimes: Yes. I probably should have mentioned as well. Move-outs to buy a house during the quarter were down almost 5% and home renting was down significantly and still less than 6% or it was down almost 10%, it's less than 6% of our move-outs. So we hear the builders are busier, but we are not seeing any impact of that here.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood. All fair points and appreciate the detail. Eric, you have previously talked about the dry powder you have in the balance sheet and you are willing to use it for the right opportunity. I am curious with the decrease in permitting levels and new supply that you referenced in your prepared remarks, when would you or would you consider ramping the development pipeline above kind of those previous ranges that you have targeted? And then also wondering if you could put a finer point on what the decrease in supply into 2021 looks like?\nEric Bolton: Well, I will take the first part and Brad you can take the supply question. Yes, I will tell you, Austin, yes, we definitely are looking for some development sites at the moment. We think that, as Brad alluded to in his comments that if we were able to start some new projects early next year, that delivering in 2022, early 2023 could be really, really strong. And so we have got existing land sites that we own in Austin, another opportunity that we are working on in Raleigh, another opportunity we are working on in Tampa. And so you are not going to see it ramp up significantly because we have also got some other projects we will be finishing up. But on balance, I think that you will likely see our development pipeline move up somewhat over the next year or so, because we think deliveries in the next two years could be quite profitable.\nBrad Hill: And Austin, this is Brad. On the supply question for 2021, I think in terms of specific numbers for 2021, it's kind of hard to pinpoint at this point. But I think if you look at the larger picture here, starting in March when COVID kind of started and the impact started hitting, it really permits, it really started to decline and construction starts more. So if you are looking at an 18 month to a 20 month time period for delivery, you are starting to get into the back half of next year, end of next year when the supply starts to go down versus previous expectations. But in terms of the magnitude of that at this point, I think it's too early to say what it is. But we do expect, starting end of next year supply coming down just based on the construction starts in permitting and then that carrying into a larger degree into 2022.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. Eric, I mean how large the development pipeline would you be willing to build, either from a dollar perspective or percent of EV?\nAl Campbell: Austin, this is Al. What we have talked about in the past is really, we wouldn't want to go above 5% of our balance sheet. But that's a pretty big number. You are talking $700 million to $800 million right now. As Eric mentioned, we have got about $450 million that we are working on. Some of that will deliver over the next year, year-and-a-half. And we will have several projects come back into the pipeline. So we would expect it to go up from the $450 million that we have right now. But you wouldn't see it go probably $800 million or something like that unless we had a specific plan or something different.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRich Anderson: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter everybody. I just want to clarify. I think it was Tom, 5,600 seeking assistance in April down to 530 in July. Was that right? And seeking assistance from the government or from you?\nTom Grimes: From us. Those are the people that we reached out to identify and it is assistance from us in term of rent abatement plans.\nEric Bolton: Your numbers are correct, Rich.\nTom Grimes: And yes, your numbers are correct, yes.\nRich Anderson: Okay. So you actually gave assistance or they were seeking assistance?\nTom Grimes: No. We gave assistance. We did it. We had plans that set up payment plans for rent over a defined time.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And I think it was you also, Tom, that mentioned, you are seeing people come from Massachusetts and New York. I find that kind of interesting. I am surprised, you are not more interested in that. You kind of brushed it off as an early sign. Don't we have to crawl before we walk? I kind of feel like that might be something to really keep an eye on. And I am wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on your perspective of that kind of in-migration dynamic you are seeing?\nTom Grimes: No, I mean the dynamic is real and it's part of the reason that we have built our strategy. While we feel like the Sunbelt is a place that\u2019s always benefited from in-migration, it's a high quality of life, it's affordable and you have some flexibility here. And then that has accelerated in latter years as taxes got more difficult and things like that. And then it seems to be further accelerating as work from home allows unprecedented flexibility on where you choose to live and things like density and transit or things that were perceived as real strengths may be less so. So we certainly read everything that you are reading and think that's interesting. And that's a lot of the reason why we are where we are. But right now, the total move-ins from those markets is still relatively low. The pickup is interesting for us and we think this is going to continue. But I don't want to overstate the impact on our demand and that's why I was perhaps being a little lighter on the point earlier.\nRich Anderson: Are people saying, I am coming here because I am afraid of what's going on? And is it impacted by COVID-19? Or is it sort of just a data point you really can't characterize it?\nTom Grimes: It is data point based on where they moved from. We have not conducted interviews. But I will tell you, when I talk to our staff members who are often moving, we have a healthy amount of people from the Northeast in Raleigh and in Charlotte and in Tampa, Chicago and in Phoenix and Denver and Dallas and Austin, it's California. They are moving and they are moving with their family and they are moving because they are out-priced and over-commuted and those are the things driving it. Now, these recent things like COVID and unrest, that may accelerate things further. But the people we have talked to, it's been lifestyle choices based on quality of life. We have not heard anybody recent enough or had a conversation recent enough to know that these other things are playing into it at this point.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. So know in migration, the fact of life in the Sunbelt generally, I just didn't know if it was significantly more than typical. But anyway I will move on. Last question from me, may be to Eric. If you get your federal support and that situation gets resolved, tariffs too, what do you think you and perhaps the industry, because I assume you talked to every other REIT about how to position earning season? Do you think guidance could come back into the mix next quarter or some time or do you think we are going to probably wait this out till 2021 comes around?\nEric Bolton: No. I think that if we see stabilization broadly begin to take place and the government programs get recommitted to, I think by the time we get to the end of October, when we are releasing Q3, we will have pretty good visibility on the balance of the year at that point. So my guess is that when we release Q3, we will have a pretty good read on the full year to that point. And then we are also starting to get some sense of where 2021 is likely to go a little bit as well. We probably will not give guidance for 2021 at the end of October. But I think we will have some evidence to at least guide expectations a bit, supply dynamics, things of that nature, probably, are pretty well known. So I am confident by the time we get to the end of October, we will have a pretty good read on the balance of the year.\nRich Anderson: Okay. That sounds great. Thanks everybody.\nEric Bolton: You bet.\nAl Campbell: Thanks Rich.\nOperator: And we will now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Yes. That's fine, Mizuho, thank you. I promise I only have two questions. So first one here is, you mentioned earlier that you have been able to review a few deals from potential sellers. I am curious what, looking at some of these shadow deals, I know they haven't closed, I am curious what they inform you on seller underwriting, maybe from a cap rate IRR perspective?\nTom Grimes: Haendel, could you say that one more time. I am sorry we had a hard time hearing you on that.\nEric Bolton: It was muffled a little bit, Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: Sure thing. I was referring to the comments you made earlier about being able to review a few deals from potential sellers. So I was curious what looking at some of these shadow deals, I know they didn't close, but I am curious what you might have learned? What reviewing the deals informed you of the seller expectations and what they are underwriting maybe from a cap rate or IRR perspective? Thanks.\nBrad Hill: Yes. Haendel, this is Brad. I will answer the first part of that. And anybody else can add in. But certainly, if you look back at second quarter, as I mentioned, volume was off tremendously. Normally in a quarter we are underwriting somewhere between 50 and 60 deals and in the second quarter we looked at 10 individual assets. So that just gives you an indication of the potential for data points is very, very limited and it's hard to draw strong conclusions from that. Of the 10 that we looked at, three have closed. Those were generally stabilized assets. Certainly, as I mentioned, the lease-up properties are not coming to market. So we really don't have any data points for pricing to indicate any pricing on those. But then as you get into the stabilized assets, you really have two camps. You have just a stabilized asset or you have a value-add. And the value-add camp is certainly seeing more of an impact. We are in constant communications with other contacts within the industry to try to help paint a broader picture of what this pricing environment looks like. And again, we just don't have a lot of data points. But I can tell you what we are generally seeing is, if you just look at the underwriting impact of what generally folks believe the impact to underwriting is of COVID going forward over the next couple of years is generally a 5% to 10% pricing discount is what folks expect. If you look at the deals that have closed, again taking out lease-ups, which haven't occurred and then taking out value-add, you are really looking at pricing discounts between 0% and 5%. And really what's helping folks bridge that gap is buyers are able to really pay a little bit more for the assets than what the underwriting would suggest because of the accommodative financing of our environment that's out there. And these high levered folks that are able to close on these transactions are able to kind of push through that pricing a little bit. But what it has indicated to us, because the fundamentals are off and the pricing is not off as much as that would suggest is the cap rates are coming down. We have seen that again on the couple of deals that we have looked at and then we are also hearing that with the industry contacts that we are talking to. But I would just say that it's very limited number of data points at this point. So it's really hard to draw strong conclusions from that at this point. And I think we will start to see some of the stabilized asset pricing point trickle out as we get a little bit further along in the year. But lease-up pricing, I think, will be next year before we start seeing that.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. That's helpful. And it largely fits with what we have heard as well. One last one. I was curious if you could talk about the blended rent growth in 2Q and July between your leading growth markets, the Austins, the Raleighs and your weaker ones, Atlanta. And maybe perhaps you could give us some thoughts on your near term expectations. Do you expect that relationship in terms of blended rent growth between the best and the worst to get wider or to narrow over the next couple of quarters? And why?\nTom Grimes: You are going to see, Haendel, I think we are seeing better progress for signed in July in Phoenix, Raleigh, Jacksonville, Greenville, places like that. Houston and Orlando flat to modestly improving. And then Savannah, as I mentioned earlier, in Charleston both improved on blended pricing during the quarter. Charleston improved a good bit, Savannah modestly. Overall, again I think we will follow on new lease pricing. I think we will follow seasonal patterns. What it gives me some encouragement is across the board in July, move-ins increased, exposure has come down and occupancy has improved during the month. And I think that sets us up well to follow sort of our typical seasonal pattern on those areas.\nHaendel St. Juste: If I could follow-up and violate what I promised I wouldn't do. Any cover on concessions? It would seem that the best and the worst markets generally, what the market or what you are seeing across some of those better markets and weaker markets is?\nTom Grimes: Yes. So we are on a net effective basis on concession. So we give a few, really where we are set up near lease-ups for the company. Concessions were 0.8% of net potential last year and are 1% this year. Our competitors, what we are seeing and as most competitive markets is in places like in Downtown Atlanta inner loop and Buckhead, one to two months free on stabilized assets, up to three on lease-up properties. In Houston inner loop, we are seeing half month to a month. Phoenix, much lighter in areas like that. And Orlando is a little softer to the south, as I mentioned, than to the north just to go around the horn. The worst concession developer thing that we have seen is four months free at a busted deal that Brad's already sniffed around on in Fredericksburg, Virginia and the DC suburbs.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Can you talk about what you guys typically see in terms of traffic and leasing volume in May, June, July from the influx of new college graduates in your core markets in a normal year and what you have seen thus far this year?\nTom Grimes: Obviously it's reflected in our overall results. Our overall exposure around the student housing is low. We don't have any property that's remotely close to half of its students. But we have seen, we have got one asset in Atlanta near Emory and it's been a little slower. But honest in terms of students coming back and we have got a few others like that, we are just using that as an opportunity to diversify what our unit mix is. So we are definitely seeing some delay on people committing to housing. It was much later. And then it's hit or miss where it is depending on what the school signaled early. And then as I suspect, it continues to evolve as schools are changing their plans. The short answer is, we have got so little exposure to it that we don't pay a ton of attention to it, but it picked up a few snippets here or there.\nRob Stevenson: No. What I was focusing on is, somebody who just graduated from, let's say, Georgia Tech and is now going to rent a unit in Atlanta with one of his buddies because last year he would have been working for a consulting firm or a tech firm or something like that. The new leases from somebody that doesn't have a background where it's the graduates whatever they are, how big a meaningful portion are college graduates in that sort of May, June, July at the beginning of the summer leasing season? And the influx of that typically in terms of your business? And what is that sort of dropped off to now? Is it half? Is it a quarter? Are all these kids staying in their parents' basements and working remotely? Or in the Sunbelt markets, have the businesses actually brought the new hires into the headquarters buildings, et cetera?\nEric Bolton: Yes. I will answer it anecdotally. And that is, we saw leasing in May and June strong enough that it offset the weakness in April and put us ahead for the quarter in aggregate and July is running ahead of last year. So our overall demand in terms of the number of leases that we have been able to execute has been a little bit better than last year. We also have not seen, often we will see either shopped or we will pick up a few where a large hire will BofA or somebody like that is bringing on a bunch of new people and they are looking for 40 units in a market and they all want to be near Peachtree Road or something like that. We are not seeing those. We are not seeing those shops. But as far as exactly what the number is of people, college grads that are looking at or not looking at, I don't have that. But we have been able to fill units as we normally would.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then, you guys talked earlier about the development starts over the next six, nine months, expected to be delivered in 2022. At what point do some of the sort of issues with COVID start to make its way and how you plan and build new development projects? I mean if I look over the last 10 years across the apartment space, units have gotten smaller. There has been more studios in the mix. You have had more central entrances and elevator banks as you have gone from three storey walk-ups to a mid-rise, et cetera. So whether or not it's urban or suburban, people have been packed in tighter. When you guys think about planning out the new developments that you will start next year, are you making any changes to the size of the units, to the unit mixes, how tenants enter, exit the building? And if you are, what is that doing to construction cost estimates when you plan this versus what you would have started a year or so ago?\nBrad Hill: Yes. Rob, this is Brad. I don't think we have made any broad changes to unit sizes or things like that. I mean I think over the last couple of years, we have been doing more dens. And one of the things we are adding is the opportunity within the club houses for a work from home type environment. We are trying to add desks and things like that, areas within some of our new units wherever we can. But I feel like there's been, at least for us over the last couple of years, there has been a push to really beefing up the amenities on the outside from the pool decks to having some congregation areas that are on the outside of the units, exterior. And I think that will continue. And we are pouring even the deals we are looking at now, quite a bit into the design and the development of those outside gathering spaces as folks look to get outside when they can. So those are the things that we are looking at. I am not sure that we have seen any type of construction cost considerations or any trends relative to those things at this point.\nEric Bolton: And Rob, I will tell you, this is Eric. We are, of all the projects that we are looking at and all that we have under way right now, only one is in an urban core area in Downtown, Orlando. Everything else that we are doing is suburban. Usually two, three story, walk up, in some cases elevators. But we have only got one project we are working on that is, what I call, real high density type project.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. What is your average square foot per unit these days?\nTom Grimes: Well, Rob, I would say, it's roughly 900 square feet, 950 square feet.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We will go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I think Eric or Brad mentioned that the upcoming election has had an adverse impact on transaction volumes. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on that? And whether that's specific to the uncertainty of 1031 exchanges?\nBrad Hill: This is Brad, John. I don't think it is relative to 1031 exchanges at this point. I think it's just another item that introduces uncertainty into the transaction market. I do think we have seen an uptick in opportunities come to market. The first part of July has been pretty robust. And generally everything that's coming out right now is off market. It's not fully marketed deals. So I am sure there are things that are coming out that we are not even seeing at the moment. But there is an uptick in that and I suspect that will continue for the next month or two and then likely dissipate as we get closer to the election. From the folks we are talking to, it's just another area of uncertainty into the valuation model that just puts folks on pause. So I don't think it's anything specific to trying to project who is elected or what policy and the impact of that policy at this point. I think it's just another unknown.\nJohn Kim: Without getting too political, I mean, is your view or the markets view that the Biden presidency would be negative for asset values?\nEric Bolton: I don't know, John. I think that I am not going to go there. I don't know how the market is, at this point, weighing, whether a Trump or Biden presidency is favorable or unfavorable. I think that what we are seeing is really just what Brad alluded to is just, there is just uncertainty and I think capital just gets a little bit nervous with uncertainty and it makes it harder to underwrite. So I think that's all we are seeing at this point.\nJohn Kim: Fair enough. Tom mentioned, in your prepared remarks, that the return of guided tours to complement your virtual and self guided tours. Did you find in the force experiments that the traditional tours or at least a hybrid approach are more effective?\nTom Grimes: No, we did not. What we found that it was thrilling to really know if they were equally as effective. And so we are very pleased with that. Those tours got us over the hump and now it's roughly 43% of our resident, of our leads, our tours are doing guided tours where they are interacting with our folks. And it's split evenly between virtual and self tours after that. We have learned an awful lot about the process. Thrilled with how the teams have worked and adapted them. And then as we get into 2021, you will see us begin to do some things that really streamline and ease the self-service side of it. But we were quite pleased with how effective they were with the residents and what the prospects and how well our teams adapted to that really overnight and used those well.\nJohn Kim: Can you provide an update as to what percentage of your communities have the capability to do self guided tours?\nTom Grimes: 100%. We have self guided tours occurring at every property in the company.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nTom Grimes: You bet.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks very much. Just two questions from me. Tom, on the new lease figures for sign in July, could you give us a sense if you excluded interior redevelopments what that new lease figure might look like? I am just trying to get a sense for what market rent growth is across your portfolio right now?\nTom Grimes: John, it would really be minimal. I would have to go back it out, but since we didn't produce any in second quarter, it is really minimal that at least we just got back to turning those on. So this is probably as clean a result on renovate impact as you are going to see.\nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Perfect. And then Brad, curious with your question or with your conversations with developers, do you get the sense, I know it's tough to read the tea leaves, but do you get the sense that they think this is a two or three month pause on their debt and equity providers given the money? Or they have become really concerned that this is kind of more of a structural multi-quarter, multi-year kind of freeze in their capital sources?\nBrad Hill: Well, I think, first of all, the development bunch is normally a very opportunistic and a very positive group. So I don't think they view this as a structural issue. I do think that they see it as problematic, because a lot of the folks that we talk to are merchant developers and their platform is certainly built on the machine continuing to run. So I think that they are out looking for alternative sources, whether this is short term or long term. But that bunch is normally, they are having glass half full normally. So I don't know that they are and I have no indications at this point that they are thinking that this is a long term shift and that they are changing their strategies because of that. But there is certainly an impact. I think the debt side of things for developers that are not this strong established sponsors with strong relationships with the banking community, those folks are going to have a hard time lining up debt for the foreseeable future.\nJohn Pawlowski: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Looking at your collection results which are clearly trending above the group, I was hoping you could walk us through the components on Page 30? Is this total build in the denominator? Is that off of the original rent? Or is that off of the newly amended lease rates? And same question for July, that 98.4%. Thank you.\nAl Campbell: Yes. Alex, this is Al. That is based on for April, May and June what was billed, that cash they are expected to pay. I mean that is what the lease would say and before any addendum, the lease would say what was signed to be and then after addendum, they would have that lease rate plus additional amount that we spread over the life of the lease. So that cash bill number is what we billed and expect them to collect in total. And the point there in that presentation was to say that, look, we have collected 98.9% in cash, another 50 basis points or 0.5% in payment addendums that we are getting very good collection performance on. I think at this point, it's about 97% compliance with that. So we feel very good about that. But having said that, we felt it was prudent to put a reserve on the books that was sufficient to cover a couple of things. One, if somebody did not come in and talk to us at all and do an addendum, fully reserve that. And if someone did do an addendum, we reserved a substantial portion of that. Somewhere, they are different for each one, but on aggregate probably two-thirds of that. So that's what that represents, the expected cash collections and where we are on that and what we reserved.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you. And a slightly different topic. In terms of occupancy and how you are thinking about the fall season coming up, historically you have been seeing great renewal growth rates. I am curious if you would like to see your occupancy number go up before maybe uncertainty in the fall? Or are you still going to be pushing those renewals? Thank you.\nTom Grimes: I will tell you that we expect occupancy to build with exposure going down, expect that to happen and bring our exposure down and prepare ourselves for the low demand timeframe. Those renewal rates, if you look at us historically in the fall, they are lower than they are in the peak season. But I would expect them to continue on at about this rate, which is still a significant lower increase than this time last year. So I would expect recovery in our renewal rates and the variable that will change to manage exposure down and occupancy up will be probably a seasonal fall off, I would expect in our new lease rates as we move into the fall.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.\nTom Grimes: You bet.\nOperator: And we will go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hi. Good morning guys. Would you happen to have a snapshot of the gain or loss to lease of the portfolio as it stands today?\nTom Grimes: What earned in the is today?\nWes Golladay: Yes.\nBrad Hill: You know Wes, we don't have that in front of me. I will see if we could get back to you on that.\nEric Bolton: We can get that to you. We will get back to you on that, Wes.\nBrad Hill: Yes. We certainly had a strong loss lease going into the second quarter. I think it's probably declined, given that leasing trends that we have seen in the quarter certainly come down. But the important point is that the actions that we took over the last year is really to continue to push price and give a little occupancy to do that, put us in a really good position going into the second quarter. So it protected us well there. It has come down. Tim can get that. And we will get that back to you offline. What we think it is, yes.\nWes Golladay: Okay. And the qualitative was good, I was kind of getting with the strong renewal to see if it's going to taper off a bit. Now turning to acquisitions, you kind of mentioned looking at lease-up properties. Would you expect a lot of off market transactions limited bid. And then secondly, would you expect competition from the levered buyers?\nBrad Hill: This is Brad. Wes, I would say, predominantly what we are seeing right now is off market. There's only been a couple, maybe 10% of what we have seen come across has been fully marketed deals. So yes, I think everything right now is going to be more off-market. Even the deals that have been marketed, some of those were pre-empted or somebody came in and just paid what the seller wanted and really short circuited the marketing process. So I expect that to continue. And then I am sorry, what was the second part of your question.\nWes Golladay: So would you expect the levered buyers to be active competition for you?\nBrad Hill: Well, not on lease-ups, I don't. We generally don't see those come into play as much on lease-ups. Those are generally focused on the assets that are currently earning, so stabilized assets, that's where you see those a little bit more. Also on lease-ups where we are focused, financing is extremely difficult right now. And that's why a lot of the sellers are not wanting to bring those to market at the moment. They are wanting to get stabilized so that they can line up financing and certainly bring those high levered buyers in there. So to the extent that developers can wait it out and get their assets stabilized, then I think the leveraged buyer can come there. But that's really not the segment of the lease-up segment that we are actually focused on.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\nTom Grimes: Wes, thank you.\nOperator: And it appears that there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the company for any final comments.\nEric Bolton: Okay. We really appreciate everyone joining our call this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, just reach out and I will be glad to answer any other questions. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thanks Tim. Results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as strong collections drove NOI performance above our internal forecast. Due to both the high quality of our portfolio and the proactive efforts by our team to work with residents impacted by the pandemic, we expect continued solid performance with collections. Encouragingly, the trends for rent payments improved over the course of the quarter. And as Tom will touch on, the positive trends continued in July, with fewer residents seeking rent deferral arrangements. As of the 27th of the month, our cash collections for July rent were a strong 98.1% which compares favorably to an average Q2 performance on a comparable basis at 96.4%. We are monitoring reports of increased levels of COVID cases in a number of Sunbelt markets. While we expect conditions will remain fluid and choppy across various states and markets, we are optimistic that efforts to reopen local businesses and economies will continue. Beyond the uncertainties associated with how various state and local economies will proceed to reopen, questions associated with actions by the federal government to extend support to individuals and businesses also remain unresolved. For these reasons, we continue to feel that conditions remain too uncertain to provide updated earnings guidance. However, as outlined in our supplemental pages to the press release, we will continue to provide more details surrounding current rent collections and leasing trends. Assuming there is no significant change in current conditions, we believe that we will continue to capture solid collections on billed rent as well as continued low resident turnover and stable occupancy. We do expect continued pressure on rent growth, but we were encouraged with the improvement in lease-over-lease pricing for leases signed in July. With a significant percentage of our leases re-pricing during the busy summer leasing season, it is important to keep in mind that we will carry these re-priced units into early leasing season next year and it will weigh on the cumulative performance of overall rent growth for the next three quarters or so. However, as new supply deliveries slow next year, we expect a resumption of more robust rent growth across our markets. Longer term, we believe that our Sunbelt markets will capture increasingly stronger trends in adding new employers, job growth and new household formations. Our unique approach to diversifying across this robust region of the country with high quality communities, supported by a sophisticated operating platform will, we believe, continue to drive long term outperformance for capital. Further, our strong balance sheet puts us in a solid position to both weather the current economic slowdown as well as opportunistically pursue compelling opportunities that emerge. In closing, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to our MAA associates for their dedication and superior service throughout the stressful second quarter. Your performance and commitment to our mission of serving our residents and all who depend on MAA, during these stressful times has been absolutely incredible. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tom. Hi Neil. Good morning Neil. No. We track that information. Overall, it's a relatively low percentage of our total leases. We didn't see much movement in the second quarter. But in July that began to tick up. So New York is up double-digits, Massachusetts up about 8.7% and Pennsylvania up about 5.3% of our increase over prior year on that. But again, still relatively low percentage of our total leases, but we are beginning to see early trends in that. We are not seeing that. We are seeing demand for urban assets. Suburban assets is a stronger pricing for us right now. But we are not seeing people transfer from urban to suburban. Yes. Orlando is, I would say, improved on the rent collection standpoint. They were one of our larger exposures back in April. They are now just 0.7% of leases outstanding or on renewal or on rent support programs. In terms of the market, Disney and Universal coming back in modest fashion have helped a little bit. We are seeing the more Northern properties perform better than the Southern properties, which have that exposure to Disney and a little bit of International. So it's sort of, I would say, largely the same with some improving rent collection trends right now. But we are pleased to see the parks open and that has a ripple effect across those Southern properties. And then Charleston frankly improved significantly. We saw a nice pickup in late second quarter and early July. I mean Savannah is still worry bead on that front. Neil, this is Eric. Also just to clarify, we are not in the business of financing other people's properties. We will come in with capital and work with developers on the basis that we will ultimately own the asset. But functioning strictly as a financier of other people's product is not what we do. We have got a very sophisticated platform and team that works to understand what the market demand is for renewal. And we use that process consistently and have trusted it over the years. And that's what we used to move out. And then, we obviously have some level of negotiation with the resident at that point. There hadn't been much in the way of sticking points. So we sort of feel like we are hitting the right spot in terms of the market, because the accept rates are actually better than in prior years. So I would say, it's a pretty honestly normal renewal process going forward. What I would tell you is that we did see, as you saw in my comments around the second quarter, we did see sort of a push back in leasing volumes in May and June which sort of caught us up from the fall off in April. But what we are seeing is sort of a normal seasonal trend at this point. And sort of pricing power, if you will, normally peaks in late July and early August. I would expect that to happen. And then of course, it will fall off in the fall under normal seasonal patterns. We are certainly seeing bargain hunters out there and our pricing is down lower than it was at this time last year. But what we are seeing is sort of normal seasonal pricing patterns now as we move past that sort of shutdown, if you will, that occurred in late March and early April. And Nick, the other thing I would add is, when you look at the average income of our portfolio of our resident profile and our average rent at this point, rent constitutes about 20% of monthly income of our resident base, pretty affordable. And so as a consequence of that, while we are certainly monitoring what's happening with the efforts to continue some government assistance at the federal level for unemployment, we are not particularly concerned about that issue, because we just haven't, for all the reasons that Tom mentioned, we just feel like that our folks have not really depended a lot on that assistance to meet the rent obligations. I would also add, Austin, when you consider the fact that 80% of our resident profile is single and only 20% married and over 50% female, this is not a demographic, this is going to be driven to move into single-family, be it for sale or for rent. So we just continue to not see any mounting evidence whatsoever that single-family is becoming more compelling as it pertains to drawing more of our traffic. Well, I will take the first part and Brad you can take the supply question. Yes, I will tell you, Austin, yes, we definitely are looking for some development sites at the moment. We think that, as Brad alluded to in his comments that if we were able to start some new projects early next year, that delivering in 2022, early 2023 could be really, really strong. And so we have got existing land sites that we own in Austin, another opportunity that we are working on in Raleigh, another opportunity we are working on in Tampa. And so you are not going to see it ramp up significantly because we have also got some other projects we will be finishing up. But on balance, I think that you will likely see our development pipeline move up somewhat over the next year or so, because we think deliveries in the next two years could be quite profitable. Your numbers are correct, Rich. No. I think that if we see stabilization broadly begin to take place and the government programs get recommitted to, I think by the time we get to the end of October, when we are releasing Q3, we will have pretty good visibility on the balance of the year at that point. So my guess is that when we release Q3, we will have a pretty good read on the full year to that point. And then we are also starting to get some sense of where 2021 is likely to go a little bit as well. We probably will not give guidance for 2021 at the end of October. But I think we will have some evidence to at least guide expectations a bit, supply dynamics, things of that nature, probably, are pretty well known. So I am confident by the time we get to the end of October, we will have a pretty good read on the balance of the year. You bet. It was muffled a little bit, Haendel. Yes. I will answer it anecdotally. And that is, we saw leasing in May and June strong enough that it offset the weakness in April and put us ahead for the quarter in aggregate and July is running ahead of last year. So our overall demand in terms of the number of leases that we have been able to execute has been a little bit better than last year. We also have not seen, often we will see either shopped or we will pick up a few where a large hire will BofA or somebody like that is bringing on a bunch of new people and they are looking for 40 units in a market and they all want to be near Peachtree Road or something like that. We are not seeing those. We are not seeing those shops. But as far as exactly what the number is of people, college grads that are looking at or not looking at, I don't have that. But we have been able to fill units as we normally would. And Rob, I will tell you, this is Eric. We are, of all the projects that we are looking at and all that we have under way right now, only one is in an urban core area in Downtown, Orlando. Everything else that we are doing is suburban. Usually two, three story, walk up, in some cases elevators. But we have only got one project we are working on that is, what I call, real high density type project. I don't know, John. I think that I am not going to go there. I don't know how the market is, at this point, weighing, whether a Trump or Biden presidency is favorable or unfavorable. I think that what we are seeing is really just what Brad alluded to is just, there is just uncertainty and I think capital just gets a little bit nervous with uncertainty and it makes it harder to underwrite. So I think that's all we are seeing at this point. We can get that to you. We will get back to you on that, Wes. Okay. We really appreciate everyone joining our call this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, just reach out and I will be glad to answer any other questions. Thanks very much."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thank you Tom. The transaction market continues to experience a material slowdown in activity, with second quarter volume within our markets down significantly from 2019. In addition to challenges in underwriting, travel moratoriums, property tour restrictions and difficulties performing due diligence, all continue to make closing a successful transaction challenging. Despite these pressures, sellers are beginning to test the waters and our number of underwritings, while still below previous years, have increased materially since the beginning of July. Certainty of execution is more important than ever and since this is one of our core strengths, we have been able to review a number of properties, mostly off market. At this point, most of the deals we have reviewed have not traded, so broad pricing trends are not yet apparent. The upcoming election is likely to further suppress transaction volume and cause the lack of pricing discovery to persist. We believe better buying opportunities on new lease-ups should emerge after the election and into 2021 as the backlog of merchant built properties, which are prevalent in our footprint, begin to hit the market. The availability of financing continues to evolve. While early in the pandemic debt financing was difficult across the board, it now remains difficult for lease-up properties as well as some developments, but it is available at very attractive rates for stabilized assets. In addition, the commitment of equity is also further restricting transaction volume and construction starts. To-date, a number of equity providers have paused or completely pulled out of quite a few new developments as well as acquisitions, sometimes for reasons not related to the real estate or the returns. This hesitancy coupled with our continued ability to perform on compelling investments has opened the door for us to review numerous opportunities through each of our external growth platforms. While we are reviewing a few acquisitions, it's still too early for new lease-up opportunities to materialize and more compelling investments on existing assets are likely to emerge late this year and into 2021. Our balance sheet is well-positioned to allow us to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. Our development team continues to pursue a number of land sites with three developments in due diligence that we hope to start construction on in 2021. With equity hesitating on new developments, we are receiving strong interest in our pre-purchase platform. We are currently in conversations on several opportunities that would likely start construction late this year or early next, with delivery occurring mid-2022 and wrapping up in 2023. These development and pre-purchase investments align well with the current delivery pipelines and will deliver at a time when we believe the leasing conditions for new developments will be significantly stronger. We are beginning to see a drop in permit activity and have seen a substantial drop in construction starts in our markets, which should result in a decrease in deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In terms of construction, the six projects we have under way remain on budget and on schedule. And to-date, we have not experienced any major disruptions or delays to any of our supply chains. With that, I will turn the call over to Al. Neil, this is Brad. I think in terms of the opportunities for the rest of the year, I do think there will be, we have seen starting in July some stabilized assets have begin to come to market. Certainly in the second quarter, there was just a complete fall off and transactions coming to market. That's picked up a bit. I think for us, our focus has always been on new lease-ups. And to-date we are not really seeing those come to market. I think there needs to be a little bit more pressure in the market before developers begin to really bring those to market. So we are really focused in seeing opportunities right now based on kind of the capital constraints that I mentioned in my opening comments. We are seeing the opportunities really emerge on the development front, land sites that have been dropped and then also on pre-purchase where we partner with developers. And for those, we have got difficulties in both debt and equity on that side that's putting some opportunities in front of us that we wouldn't have had. Nick, you were a little muffled. And we are all trying to talk through masks, I suspect. But I think you were asking correlation between hotspots and leasing volume. Is that correct? And Austin, this is Brad. On the supply question for 2021, I think in terms of specific numbers for 2021, it's kind of hard to pinpoint at this point. But I think if you look at the larger picture here, starting in March when COVID kind of started and the impact started hitting, it really permits, it really started to decline and construction starts more. So if you are looking at an 18 month to a 20 month time period for delivery, you are starting to get into the back half of next year, end of next year when the supply starts to go down versus previous expectations. But in terms of the magnitude of that at this point, I think it's too early to say what it is. But we do expect, starting end of next year supply coming down just based on the construction starts in permitting and then that carrying into a larger degree into 2022. Yes. Haendel, this is Brad. I will answer the first part of that. And anybody else can add in. But certainly, if you look back at second quarter, as I mentioned, volume was off tremendously. Normally in a quarter we are underwriting somewhere between 50 and 60 deals and in the second quarter we looked at 10 individual assets. So that just gives you an indication of the potential for data points is very, very limited and it's hard to draw strong conclusions from that. Of the 10 that we looked at, three have closed. Those were generally stabilized assets. Certainly, as I mentioned, the lease-up properties are not coming to market. So we really don't have any data points for pricing to indicate any pricing on those. But then as you get into the stabilized assets, you really have two camps. You have just a stabilized asset or you have a value-add. And the value-add camp is certainly seeing more of an impact. We are in constant communications with other contacts within the industry to try to help paint a broader picture of what this pricing environment looks like. And again, we just don't have a lot of data points. But I can tell you what we are generally seeing is, if you just look at the underwriting impact of what generally folks believe the impact to underwriting is of COVID going forward over the next couple of years is generally a 5% to 10% pricing discount is what folks expect. If you look at the deals that have closed, again taking out lease-ups, which haven't occurred and then taking out value-add, you are really looking at pricing discounts between 0% and 5%. And really what's helping folks bridge that gap is buyers are able to really pay a little bit more for the assets than what the underwriting would suggest because of the accommodative financing of our environment that's out there. And these high levered folks that are able to close on these transactions are able to kind of push through that pricing a little bit. But what it has indicated to us, because the fundamentals are off and the pricing is not off as much as that would suggest is the cap rates are coming down. We have seen that again on the couple of deals that we have looked at and then we are also hearing that with the industry contacts that we are talking to. But I would just say that it's very limited number of data points at this point. So it's really hard to draw strong conclusions from that at this point. And I think we will start to see some of the stabilized asset pricing point trickle out as we get a little bit further along in the year. But lease-up pricing, I think, will be next year before we start seeing that. Yes. Rob, this is Brad. I don't think we have made any broad changes to unit sizes or things like that. I mean I think over the last couple of years, we have been doing more dens. And one of the things we are adding is the opportunity within the club houses for a work from home type environment. We are trying to add desks and things like that, areas within some of our new units wherever we can. But I feel like there's been, at least for us over the last couple of years, there has been a push to really beefing up the amenities on the outside from the pool decks to having some congregation areas that are on the outside of the units, exterior. And I think that will continue. And we are pouring even the deals we are looking at now, quite a bit into the design and the development of those outside gathering spaces as folks look to get outside when they can. So those are the things that we are looking at. I am not sure that we have seen any type of construction cost considerations or any trends relative to those things at this point. This is Brad, John. I don't think it is relative to 1031 exchanges at this point. I think it's just another item that introduces uncertainty into the transaction market. I do think we have seen an uptick in opportunities come to market. The first part of July has been pretty robust. And generally everything that's coming out right now is off market. It's not fully marketed deals. So I am sure there are things that are coming out that we are not even seeing at the moment. But there is an uptick in that and I suspect that will continue for the next month or two and then likely dissipate as we get closer to the election. From the folks we are talking to, it's just another area of uncertainty into the valuation model that just puts folks on pause. So I don't think it's anything specific to trying to project who is elected or what policy and the impact of that policy at this point. I think it's just another unknown. Well, I think, first of all, the development bunch is normally a very opportunistic and a very positive group. So I don't think they view this as a structural issue. I do think that they see it as problematic, because a lot of the folks that we talk to are merchant developers and their platform is certainly built on the machine continuing to run. So I think that they are out looking for alternative sources, whether this is short term or long term. But that bunch is normally, they are having glass half full normally. So I don't know that they are and I have no indications at this point that they are thinking that this is a long term shift and that they are changing their strategies because of that. But there is certainly an impact. I think the debt side of things for developers that are not this strong established sponsors with strong relationships with the banking community, those folks are going to have a hard time lining up debt for the foreseeable future. You know Wes, we don't have that in front of me. I will see if we could get back to you on that. Yes. We certainly had a strong loss lease going into the second quarter. I think it's probably declined, given that leasing trends that we have seen in the quarter certainly come down. But the important point is that the actions that we took over the last year is really to continue to push price and give a little occupancy to do that, put us in a really good position going into the second quarter. So it protected us well there. It has come down. Tim can get that. And we will get that back to you offline. What we think it is, yes. This is Brad. Wes, I would say, predominantly what we are seeing right now is off market. There's only been a couple, maybe 10% of what we have seen come across has been fully marketed deals. So yes, I think everything right now is going to be more off-market. Even the deals that have been marketed, some of those were pre-empted or somebody came in and just paid what the seller wanted and really short circuited the marketing process. So I expect that to continue. And then I am sorry, what was the second part of your question. Well, not on lease-ups, I don't. We generally don't see those come into play as much on lease-ups. Those are generally focused on the assets that are currently earning, so stabilized assets, that's where you see those a little bit more. Also on lease-ups where we are focused, financing is extremely difficult right now. And that's why a lot of the sellers are not wanting to bring those to market at the moment. They are wanting to get stabilized so that they can line up financing and certainly bring those high levered buyers in there. So to the extent that developers can wait it out and get their assets stabilized, then I think the leveraged buyer can come there. But that's really not the segment of the lease-up segment that we are actually focused on."

            "content": "Thank you Eric and good morning everyone. I will offer a short recap on the second quarter and then move to trends that we have seen through July. The initial slowdown in demand triggered by COVID-19 in late March has moderated and trends are improving. Our teams have adapted and have been effective using our virtual self-tour platform. These practices were further augmented by our return to guided tours in May. Leasing volume in April was down versus prior year by 9% of volume and May and June were strong enough and leasing volume for the quarter was 0.6% higher than last year. Effective rents were up 3.4% and blended lease-over-lease pricing including concessions was up 1.2%. Occupancy remained steady at 95.4%. And turnover for the quarter was down 7% versus last year. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the quarter, we restarted our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. As noted in the supplemental document, collections during the quarter were strong, we worked diligently to identify and support those who needed help as a result of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped with each month. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants decreased each month thereafter and it's just 530 for the July rental assistance plan. This represents 0.5% of our 100,000 units. As a reminder, in addition to the flexible payment plans for those affected by COVID-19, we have not charged late fees, we have frozen eviction proceedings and actively worked to pair affected residents with local and national support resources. While we are still below our normal run rate, the reduction in the number of residents on a rental assistance planned aided our fee income during the second quarter. As of July 27, we have collected 98.1% of rent billed for July. This is a 170 basis points better than April, May and June results at the same day of the month. Adding the 0.3% of deferred payments for COVID-19 affected resident payment plans, referenced in the COVID-19 disclosure, we have accounted for 98.4% of July's billed rent. This is an encouraging result, but we are keeping a close eye on the CARES Act expiration and the discussion around the continuation of government benefits. Leasing volume for July is on track to exceed last year. Historically, pricing power peaks in the early third quarter and thus far July has been our best pricing month since COVID-19 hit. Net July month-to-date blended lease-over-lease rates signed during the month increased 1.7%. This is more than 100 basis points better than leases signed in the second quarter. While we see this improvement across asset types and locations, our B assets and our suburban locations are stronger. In addition to positive pricing trends, occupancy has also strengthened. Occupancy has improved from a low point of 95.1% to 95.7% today. Sixty day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, has dropped from a high of 9.2% in April to 8.4% in June and is now 8%. Our current residents are choosing to stay with us and our resident renewal retention rates were also positive. August, September and October renewal accept rates are running ahead of prior years and signed lease-over-lease rates are in the 4% to 5% range. I would like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They have served and cared for our residents and our associates well and have grappled with the constantly changing implications of COVID-19. They worked diligently to provide supportive and caring environments for our residents and one another. I am proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. I will now turn the call over to Brad. Thanks Neil. The other thing I would add is that, I think the fact that you are seeing performance along the lines of what you are describing, you really have to start thinking about different parts of the country. And our Sunbelt markets have just continued to, we think, demonstrate a certain resiliency to them that is stronger than what we are seeing in other regions of the country. And as a consequence of that, things were depressed from where they were a year ago, but patterns and overall behavior in activity surrounding leasing and renewal is pretty much in line with patterns that we have seen historically. Thank you. Nick, we have not seen much in the way of correlation on that. You know, the market fundamentals really seem to be driven more by where the layoffs are occurring and then some variability between location and the submarket. But we are not seeing leasing fall-off in, let's say, high positivity markets versus low positivity markets at this point, unless those correlate with unemployment levels. We do not have insight into their source of income, Nick. But the fact that we have seen such an improvement and in terms of the number of people asking support from us and the feedback that we get, when we interact with our assistant property managers and our property managers, which as you can imagine, we are doing a ton of right now is that the people getting off are not getting off the plans because their government check came in. They are getting off the plans because they got more hours or they got pulled back off of furlough or Disney opened and they are now engaged in some sort of support capacity. Thank you Nick. Yes. Austin, I appreciate the question. I think it really is the underlying outlay of our markets in our area of the country and what we are seeing is normal patterns. And I mean I appreciate the comment on strong demand. I am not sure I would quite classify that other than strong relative demand. But demand is clearly off of the levels that we were seeing last year. But I mean we like the resiliency that we are seeing. We are spread out across the Sunbelt, which is a place that is I think appealing, especially in this timeframe and was already a major driver for jobs. And then we have allocated across, we have got across different market types as well. So it is holding up well and the defensive nature of our portfolio I think is showing, but I would hold short before I called it strong demand, I would call relatively strong demand, which we are pleased with. Yes. I probably should have mentioned as well. Move-outs to buy a house during the quarter were down almost 5% and home renting was down significantly and still less than 6% or it was down almost 10%, it's less than 6% of our move-outs. So we hear the builders are busier, but we are not seeing any impact of that here. From us. Those are the people that we reached out to identify and it is assistance from us in term of rent abatement plans. And yes, your numbers are correct, yes. No. We gave assistance. We did it. We had plans that set up payment plans for rent over a defined time. No, I mean the dynamic is real and it's part of the reason that we have built our strategy. While we feel like the Sunbelt is a place that's always benefited from in-migration, it's a high quality of life, it's affordable and you have some flexibility here. And then that has accelerated in latter years as taxes got more difficult and things like that. And then it seems to be further accelerating as work from home allows unprecedented flexibility on where you choose to live and things like density and transit or things that were perceived as real strengths may be less so. So we certainly read everything that you are reading and think that's interesting. And that's a lot of the reason why we are where we are. But right now, the total move-ins from those markets is still relatively low. The pickup is interesting for us and we think this is going to continue. But I don't want to overstate the impact on our demand and that's why I was perhaps being a little lighter on the point earlier. It is data point based on where they moved from. We have not conducted interviews. But I will tell you, when I talk to our staff members who are often moving, we have a healthy amount of people from the Northeast in Raleigh and in Charlotte and in Tampa, Chicago and in Phoenix and Denver and Dallas and Austin, it's California. They are moving and they are moving with their family and they are moving because they are out-priced and over-commuted and those are the things driving it. Now, these recent things like COVID and unrest, that may accelerate things further. But the people we have talked to, it's been lifestyle choices based on quality of life. We have not heard anybody recent enough or had a conversation recent enough to know that these other things are playing into it at this point. Haendel, could you say that one more time. I am sorry we had a hard time hearing you on that. You are going to see, Haendel, I think we are seeing better progress for signed in July in Phoenix, Raleigh, Jacksonville, Greenville, places like that. Houston and Orlando flat to modestly improving. And then Savannah, as I mentioned earlier, in Charleston both improved on blended pricing during the quarter. Charleston improved a good bit, Savannah modestly. Overall, again I think we will follow on new lease pricing. I think we will follow seasonal patterns. What it gives me some encouragement is across the board in July, move-ins increased, exposure has come down and occupancy has improved during the month. And I think that sets us up well to follow sort of our typical seasonal pattern on those areas. Yes. So we are on a net effective basis on concession. So we give a few, really where we are set up near lease-ups for the company. Concessions were 0.8% of net potential last year and are 1% this year. Our competitors, what we are seeing and as most competitive markets is in places like in Downtown Atlanta inner loop and Buckhead, one to two months free on stabilized assets, up to three on lease-up properties. In Houston inner loop, we are seeing half month to a month. Phoenix, much lighter in areas like that. And Orlando is a little softer to the south, as I mentioned, than to the north just to go around the horn. The worst concession developer thing that we have seen is four months free at a busted deal that Brad's already sniffed around on in Fredericksburg, Virginia and the DC suburbs. Obviously it's reflected in our overall results. Our overall exposure around the student housing is low. We don't have any property that's remotely close to half of its students. But we have seen, we have got one asset in Atlanta near Emory and it's been a little slower. But honest in terms of students coming back and we have got a few others like that, we are just using that as an opportunity to diversify what our unit mix is. So we are definitely seeing some delay on people committing to housing. It was much later. And then it's hit or miss where it is depending on what the school signaled early. And then as I suspect, it continues to evolve as schools are changing their plans. The short answer is, we have got so little exposure to it that we don't pay a ton of attention to it, but it picked up a few snippets here or there. Well, Rob, I would say, it's roughly 900 square feet, 950 square feet. No, we did not. What we found that it was thrilling to really know if they were equally as effective. And so we are very pleased with that. Those tours got us over the hump and now it's roughly 43% of our resident, of our leads, our tours are doing guided tours where they are interacting with our folks. And it's split evenly between virtual and self tours after that. We have learned an awful lot about the process. Thrilled with how the teams have worked and adapted them. And then as we get into 2021, you will see us begin to do some things that really streamline and ease the self-service side of it. But we were quite pleased with how effective they were with the residents and what the prospects and how well our teams adapted to that really overnight and used those well. 100%. We have self guided tours occurring at every property in the company. You bet. John, it would really be minimal. I would have to go back it out, but since we didn't produce any in second quarter, it is really minimal that at least we just got back to turning those on. So this is probably as clean a result on renovate impact as you are going to see. I will tell you that we expect occupancy to build with exposure going down, expect that to happen and bring our exposure down and prepare ourselves for the low demand timeframe. Those renewal rates, if you look at us historically in the fall, they are lower than they are in the peak season. But I would expect them to continue on at about this rate, which is still a significant lower increase than this time last year. So I would expect recovery in our renewal rates and the variable that will change to manage exposure down and occupancy up will be probably a seasonal fall off, I would expect in our new lease rates as we move into the fall. You bet. What earned in the is today? Wes, thank you."

            "name": "Al Campbell",
            "content": "Thank you Brad and good morning everyone. I will provide some brief commentary on the company's recent earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. As mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the second quarter performance, particularly in the area of rent collections. At beginning of the pandemic, this area was the most significant short term unknown with rental pricing expected to have a longer term impact as new leases rolled through the portfolio. As noted in the supplement, through July 27, we either fully collected or obtained deferral agreements for 98.4% of all rent billed during the second quarter. And at this point, we have had very good payment performance from our deferral addendums with a 97% compliance rate on outstanding agreements. We also established a reserve sufficient to cover all rent unpaid from residents not entering a formal agreement as well as a large portion of the deferred rent. July continued the strong trend in rent collections, but given the remaining high level of uncertainty, we do not yet have enough clarity to reestablish earnings for overall same-store guidance for the year. However, we do have a little more clarity on operating expenses and overall, we still expect them to end up essentially in line with our initial forecast for the year. As a reminder, we initially outlined same-store expense growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.75% to 4.75% growth or 4.25% growth at the midpoint. The primary pressure is coming from real estate taxes, insurance and the roll out of the bulk Internet cable program called Double Play. The context and the contribution to expense growth, ignoring these three items, all other operating expenses are expected to grow about 2.5% for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to support our business plans very well with leverage near historic lows and significant capacity from cash and remaining borrow potential under our line of credit combining for $927 million of capacity. We restarted our redevelopment programs during the quarter and our development pipeline continues to progress well and on track. We expect to fund between $200 million and $250 million balance for the full year toward the completion of our development pipeline. As Brad mentioned, the acquisition environment remains challenging with most opportunities expected to be pre-purchase deals, which will have longer term funding commitments similar to a development. We currently expect our business plans for the remainder of the year to be essentially leverage neutral not requiring any equity funding this year. However, as previously discussed, our plans do include a potential bond deal in the second half of the year to fully pay off our line of credit, maintaining our capacity and prepaying some future debt maturities in today's low rate environment. And finally, as reflected in our release, we incurred $2.4 million of COVID-19 related expenses during the second quarter, primarily consisting of additional cleaning supplies, COVID-19 related leave and contract labor. We added these costs back to core FFO as these initial expenses are considered non-recurring in nature. We do expect remaining costs to be much smaller over the second half of the year. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions. Thank you. I think you caught it in your earlier comments. July was priced on the renewal front at the sort of peak concern level at this point or thus far. So we would expect at this point the renewal rates for July, that took place in July, to be the low point renewals. And in July we are 4.5%. And I think we expect September and October to be between 4% and 5% range going forward. So a little recovery in renewal rates is what we are expecting. Austin, this is Al. What we have talked about in the past is really, we wouldn't want to go above 5% of our balance sheet. But that's a pretty big number. You are talking $700 million to $800 million right now. As Eric mentioned, we have got about $450 million that we are working on. Some of that will deliver over the next year, year-and-a-half. And we will have several projects come back into the pipeline. So we would expect it to go up from the $450 million that we have right now. But you wouldn't see it go probably $800 million or something like that unless we had a specific plan or something different. Thanks Rich. Yes. Alex, this is Al. That is based on for April, May and June what was billed, that cash they are expected to pay. I mean that is what the lease would say and before any addendum, the lease would say what was signed to be and then after addendum, they would have that lease rate plus additional amount that we spread over the life of the lease. So that cash bill number is what we billed and expect them to collect in total. And the point there in that presentation was to say that, look, we have collected 98.9% in cash, another 50 basis points or 0.5% in payment addendums that we are getting very good collection performance on. I think at this point, it's about 97% compliance with that. So we feel very good about that. But having said that, we felt it was prudent to put a reserve on the books that was sufficient to cover a couple of things. One, if somebody did not come in and talk to us at all and do an addendum, fully reserve that. And if someone did do an addendum, we reserved a substantial portion of that. Somewhere, they are different for each one, but on aggregate probably two-thirds of that. So that's what that represents, the expected cash collections and where we are on that and what we reserved."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 7, 2020.I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, EVP and Head of Transactions.Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that, as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections.We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statement section in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and our \u201834 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and thanks to all of you on the call this morning for joining us. I know it\u2019s a busy day of earnings reports. So we\u2019ll keep our comments brief and get to your questions. I\u2019d like to start by offering my appreciation and thanks to the hard-working associates at MAA.I especially want to thank our associates serving at our properties and working directly with our residents. Your dedication and commitment to supporting and serving our residents has been on full display over the past few weeks and has never been more important than it is today. I\u2019m proud of work you\u2019re doing and the service that you\u2019re providing.As noted in our earnings release, first quarter results were better than expected with solid rent growth and strong same-store performance. Our comments this morning, however, will focus on April performance and early May trends. We\u2019re encouraged by the solid performance in rent collection for April as well as the early trends in May.We\u2019ve taken a proactive approach to directly assist and support those residents who are financially impacted by the shutdown of the economy, while also working to ensure that all other residents in various aspects of our operations are performing and functioning as expected. Given the severe pullback in the economy and the associated job losses, leasing conditions deteriorated beginning in late March.This is particularly evident in our leasing trends as it applies to new move-in residents. On the other hand, we\u2019re seeing positive trends associated with our existing residents electing to stay put and resident turnover continues to decline. Overall, we would expect these leasing conditions to persist over the next 2 to 3 months.As you know, the reopening of local economies and businesses across our Sunbelt markets is now underway. Given the range of protocols being used by various states and cities to reopen their economies, it will be a choppy process. However, with unemployment claims across the majority of our states currently running below national averages, coupled with the active efforts underway to reopen across the Sunbelt, we\u2019re hopeful that leasing conditions will start to improve later this year.As efforts to reopen Sunbelt economies are just now getting underway, it\u2019s difficult at the moment to gauge the pace at which employment conditions will improve. We hope to gain better visibility on the important underlying economic and employment market conditions during the second quarter and be in a more informed position as to the outlook for the remainder of the year when we report second quarter results.In the meantime, we\u2019re confident that our strategy focused on the appealing Sunbelt markets, supported by our strong operating platform and our strong balance sheet, executed by a cycle-tested and proven team of associates, will enable MAA to continue to successfully navigate this down-cycle.That\u2019s all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll offer a short recap on the first quarter and then move to trends that we have seen in April and May. First quarter of 2020 exceeded our expectations, and the results for the quarter put us in a strong position entering this disruptive COVID-19 period.Effective rents were up 4.2% and blended lease-over-lease pricing, including concessions, was up 2.6%, which was in line with seasonal expectations. Occupancy remained strong at 95.7%. Before shelter-in-place began in mid-March, occupancy was 95.9%, and our 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, was just 7.6%. This was 40 basis points better than last year.In short, we headed into the COVID-19 disruption with strong occupancy, low 60-day exposure and good embedded rent growth. During the quarter, we completed 1,440 interior redevelopment units and upgraded 8,017 units with our SmartHome technology package. We felt it was prudent to pause both of these programs in March. We\u2019ll monitor demand for these 2 programs and return to production when appropriate.Moving on to April and May trends. Historically, April is a month of accelerating pricing growth as we move into the higher demand season of the year. As you will note from our lease-over-lease pricing, which includes concessions information listed in the supplemental data, you\u2019ll notice this year did not follow that trend.New lease, leasing volume dropped 43% lower than prior year in the last week of March. However, the last 3 weeks, leasing volume has rebounded and is 6% higher than prior year levels. Our teams have been effective at using our virtual and self-tour platform. We expect these practices to be further augmented by guided tours in May.As expected, our current residents are choosing to stay with us, and our resident retention plans are positive. Turnover for the month of April was down 8% versus April of last year. May, June and July renewal acceptance rates are all running ahead of last year at this time.We have worked diligently to identify and support those who need help as a result of COVID-19. 1.3% of our April billed rent is on a 60-day plan to pay, it was established to aid those who are impacted by COVID-19. In addition to flexible payment plans for those affected by COVID-19, we have not charged late fees, frozen eviction proceedings and actively work to pair affected residents with local and national support resources. These changes will cause our late fee income to be lower than expected in the second quarter.Collections have been a focus. In April, we have collected 98% of rent billed for April. When you add the 1.3% of COVID-19 resident \u2013 affected resident payment plans that were mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve accounted for 99.3% of April\u2019s billed rent. This is in line with prior year results.May rent payment trends are slightly ahead of April\u2019s patterns. As of May 5, we have collected or executed payment plans for 94.2% of our May billed rent as compared to 92.6% of cash collections and executed payment plans at the same point in April.I\u2019d like to echo Eric\u2019s comments and thank our teams as well. They\u2019ve served and cared for our residents and associates well as we\u2019ve grappled with the constantly changing implications of COVID-19. I\u2019m proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. Brad?\nBradley Hill: Thank you, Tom. We are certainly in unprecedented times, and the transaction market fully reflects this reality. The transaction market is generally in a wait-and-see mode, and the only transactions occurring are those that were either fully committed before COVID-19 hit with their debt and equity lined up or deals that have a strong buyer need to close, such as the 1031 exchange. Because of this slowdown in activity and in an effort to allow our associates to focus on our properties and our residents, we\u2019ve elected to pause the disposition process of our Jackson, Mississippi properties, and we\u2019ll re-evaluate the sale of those assets at a later date.At this time, we have no insight into any potential cap rate changes due to the lack of activity. Going forward, due diligence processes will be extended, meaning it could be a few months before cap rates and pricing trends are more apparent. We believe the changes taking place due to COVID-19 will potentially lead to more attractive investment opportunities through each of our platforms, land sites for future ground up development, pre-purchase development where we partner with strong developers and acquisition of existing assets. It\u2019s too early to say when the opportunities will begin to materialize, but we continue to work closely with our network of brokers and developers to monitor a number of previously identified opportunities.Since the pandemic hit, new development has shut down with most developers halting all predevelopment spending and many dropping land sites. Construction debt is non-existent, forcing developers to shelf many shovel-ready projects. Due to our balance sheet strength and our available capital through our line of credit, we are receiving more calls from developers looking for capital. As we filter through all opportunities that come our way, we will remain very selective, cautious in our approach and disciplined in our underwriting. With a significant pullback in capital sources for new development, we expect new starts to decline significantly over the next few months, leading to a sharp drop in deliveries within our markets in a couple of years.With regard to the acquisition of existing assets, we continue to monitor the fundamentals in our markets with a significant focus on newly delivered assets that are still in lease-up. This segment of the market is likely to experience the most pressure as rents underperform, concessions increase and stabilization is delayed. Additionally, agencies have pulled back on their funding of non-stabilized assets, limiting the buyer pool for this segment.Finally, just a note on construction, we have been fortunate that all of the municipalities in which we operate have classified construction as an essential business, and we have seen very little impact to the construction schedule of our 7 development projects.With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Al.\nAlbert Campbell: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some brief commentary on the company\u2019s recent earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. While the main focus of the call this morning is on April performance and May trends, it is important to remember that we did have a strong first quarter performance.Our reported core FFO for the first quarter of $1.62 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was essentially evenly split between favorable operations, primarily revenues and other items below NOI, primarily favorable interest expense for the quarter.Given the significant economic uncertainty related to COVID-19, we formally withdrew our guidance in March and don\u2019t yet have enough clarity to reestablish full year guidance. But to provide as much information about current trends as we could, we added a COVID-19 update section in our supplemental data package, Pages S11 and S12, which has a lot of information about April performance, including collections, leasing, occupancy and other key metrics and some additional very current information about our May collections.And as noted in our release for April and May, we provided flexible payment options and waived late fees for residents financially impacted by the pandemic. Thus far, we\u2019ve been encouraged by April and early May cash collections both for current rent and deferred payments. But as Tom mentioned, we do expect fee performance to reflect more pressure in the near-term as partial resident payments are applied to rent first, and because we waived late fees and certain lease termination fees for impacted residents. You can find details for April fees along with historical context from this in the supplement.As Eric mentioned, our general expectation is for the current leasing conditions to persist over the next few months, continuing to impact revenue performance. However, overall, we expect operating expenses to remain fairly consistent with our original expectations as we expect 2 largest expense areas, personnel and real estate taxes, to remain near early projections for the year with some benefits expected in maintenance costs from lower turnover perhaps offset by slightly higher utilities and marketing expenses. Also below NOI, we expect overhead and interest costs to trend somewhat lower than original expectations for the year as hiring plans and short-term borrowing costs will also be impacted by the current economic environment.Finally, it\u2019s important to point out that many of the activities over the last few years to strengthen our balance sheet position us well in the current challenging environment. Our total leverage remains at a historically low level. We have a significant capacity provided by our $1 billion unsecured credit facility, which is expandable to $1.5 billion. Also, our debt maturities for 2020 are only $137 million.Our remaining development funding obligation for the year is a modest $175 million to $200 million. Although the capital markets have not fully recovered, recent transactions exhibit good access to public bonds and other forms of capital, especially for companies with strong credit metrics such as MAA. We\u2019re positioned to not only weather the current stress well but to eventually pursue opportunities that may result.Though we are committed to our long-term leverage range, given our current metrics, our rating \u2013 we expect that we could immediately invest around $750 million in quality properties funded with debt alone. For the appropriate opportunity and plan, additional capacity is likely available as well.That\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Keith, we\u2019ll now turn the call over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Want to make sure on the 4% decline that you\u2019re seeing in May, if that\u2019s a good run rate going forward. And also, on the renewal rates, is that something that\u2019s broad brushed or is it specific markets that you\u2019re pushing these renewal rates higher?\nThomas Grimes: John, you were a little blurred on the first question. Was it on the May delinquency; is the run rate what we expect to continue?\nJohn Kim: Just the decline in new rental rates, so that\u2019s if you\u2019d provide any commentary by market and if that\u2019s a good run rate for the remainder of the year.\nThomas Grimes: I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a good run rate for the remainder of the year, but I think April and May are running pretty similar to each other at this point. Really, the run rate for the remainder of the year depends on how rapidly the economy recovers from the COVID-19.\nEric Bolton: And in answer to your second part of your question, the renewal performance, renewal pricing performance is pretty consistent throughout the markets in the portfolio. There\u2019s really no difference there.\nJohn Kim: Right, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.\nNeil Malkin: Hey, guys, good morning. Can you just talk about the collections or the request from residents that had been financially impacted, how that sort of trended across your markets and asset quality and even submarket location?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah, I\u2019ll give you, Neil \u2013 this is Tom \u2013 just sort of a broad brush. As far as the request came in, they were a little higher in places that are affected by tourism, such as Orlando, Savannah and Charleston. They were as high as $7 million in requests, but $5 million of that has been paid off at this point.On asset quality, we\u2019re not seeing any difference at all. A is paid at 98.1% cash with 1.3% deferred and Bs were 97.9% with 1.3% deferred. So really on an asset class basis, and honestly, if you look at it by suburban-urban or high-rise looking at mid-rise or a garden, those are fairly consistent. The differentiation really comes by market characteristic.\nNeil Malkin: No, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. I was wondering if \u2013 your collections seem to be the highest for any of the apartment REITs that reported last night. I was wondering, do you \u2013 what do you attribute that to? I mean I think some people have talked about the Sunbelt maybe not holding up as well as some of the tech-oriented coastal markets, but you seem to be doing, like I said, better than your peers. Kind of what do you attribute that to?\nEric Bolton: Well, Neil, this is Eric. I would tell you that it starts with a principle that we really want to help those people who need help. And I think one of the best ways that you help people that really need help is you also expect that the other aspects of your operation perform as they should and as they\u2019re capable of. And so, what we\u2019ve attempted to do here is to be very proactive at communicating with our residents and reaching out actively to those that need help and \u2013 but also making sure that people understand that this is a program that\u2019s intended to help those who truly need help.The other thing that we opted to do is really take more of a rifle shot approach to the market environment we find ourselves in. And rather than come out early when conditions were really just a lot unknown at the time and just suggest that we\u2019re going to treat everybody in the same way with these following programs, we really elected to instead take it sort of month by month, approach it on a case-by-case basis in some cases, which gives us the ability to adapt and change as conditions evolve.And so, I think we took a very measured approach to things, and a lot of communication went on with residents and with our associates at the properties. And I think through all that, it resulted in a collection performance that we feel pretty good about.\nNeil Malkin: All right. Great. I appreciate that. One last quick one on the accounting side. Are you planning on recognizing the delinquency, sort of netting that against billed revenue? Or are you going to recognize that on a GAAP or FFO basis and then have some sort of straight-line offset in AFFO?\nAlbert Campbell: Well, for the vast majority \u2013 Neil, this is Al. We certainly expect, once we release our earnings for the second quarter, that we\u2019ll have a portion of \u2013 that we\u2019ll have a bad debt reserve that identifies what we think will ultimately collect on some things. Important to note that the information we put in the press release this morning was on a cash basis. It really doesn\u2019t reflect any of that.And so, anything we see in the second quarter and more flexibility will be a good thing for us. And it\u2019s also important to note that the commercial side of our business, you mentioned straight-lining, at least the commercial side of our business, is much, much smaller than the 1.5% of our revenues. And for those ones, we are taking a month and pushing it to the end of the lease like many of the commercial operators are and spreading it out over the life of the lease.But for multifamily residents, yeah, we\u2019re doing a normal collection process with a \u2013 ultimately have a bad debt reserve when we release second quarter earnings.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is, if you have, let\u2019s say, 2% delinquency, you wouldn\u2019t report that as like sort of 98% of rent collected. You\u2019d report it as 100% and then just discount it by whatever you think the uncollectible bad debt is. Is that correct?\nAlbert Campbell: That\u2019s exactly right. I mean, so what we\u2019re showing you is \u2013 the point I\u2019m trying to make is the information we\u2019re showing in the release on April and on May is just gross, not collected rent at this point. 2.3% of our rent and fees together is uncollected, but from that, we have 1.3%, which is we have promises to pay, which we feel like we will collect the vast majority of them. And put us in a much better position. So when we report our earnings for the second quarter, we will have likely reported revenue for a large part of that.\nNeil Malkin: Thank you. Well, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning, everybody. Just curious, Brad or Eric, the calls that you\u2019ve received from developers looking for capital been related to new starts, like projects that are under construction or projects that are in lease-up. And then, can you give us a sense of where you think terms are for financing today, best guess?\nBradley Hill: Well, Austin, this is Brad. The calls we\u2019re getting so far are for new starts. I mean I think it\u2019s too early really to start getting calls for deals that are in lease-up, but as I indicated in my comments, I do think that there\u2019s going to be some pressure on the new lease-up segment, and we will start getting those calls. I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to materialize. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be.But the calls we\u2019re getting right now are from developers who thought they had their debt and equity lined up. And they\u2019re 2 months out from starting construction. And now they have no debt, they have no equity. So those are the calls we\u2019re getting right now. And as I said, we\u2019re getting a lot of those calls, because we looked at a lot of those deals originally and may be another equity source, got the deal for whatever reason.But it\u2019s too early, we think, to really kick off any of those deals. We need a little bit more time to let kind of the cloud settle around us.In terms of debt terms, they\u2019re certainly worse than they were before COVID-19 hit. I think, certainly, LTVs are down really across the board. There\u2019s additional requirements that are going to affect the proceeds that borrowers are going to get. They\u2019re looking at trailing 3 months operations, which are going to be impacted by what\u2019s going on around us, some more so than others. So that\u2019s going to affect the proceeds that folks are getting and should, as I said, lead to additional opportunities for us on the buy side.But there are additional requirements that agencies are putting on buyers that are hampering their ability to get their max proceeds right now. But the spreads have come down from the end of March, so they\u2019re not as bad as they have been. They\u2019re getting somewhat better.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So as you think about underwriting cost today, just curious, where do you think costs are today versus pre-COVID?\nBradley Hill: Well, contractors are not quick to lower their pricing. I think it\u2019s going to still take some time before we see a potential reduction in price kind of come through the system. I mean, from a sub standpoint, they still have jobs that they\u2019re working on right now. I think, certainly the new deals that they\u2019re pricing will start to trend down, but I think that\u2019s going to be a few months before you start seeing some cost reductions come through the system. It\u2019s not going to be immediate.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then as it relates to operations, you guys had previously focused on pushing rates at the risk of maybe losing some occupancy. And as you alluded to, I believe, occupancy is going to become more of a focus. Do you think there\u2019s room or enough demand to re-ramp occupancy in the coming months?\nThomas Grimes: What we\u2019ve seen \u2013 we made that shift pretty quickly. We saw a falloff in move-ins in late March that has recovered. And we have \u2013 our demand metrics are pretty good right now, right. Austin, what I\u2019d say, but I would say we\u2019re treading water at this point. We\u2019ve got enough demand to hold on. And then it really just depends on how the economy shakes out, and that will be \u2013 that will vary across the Sunbelt based on locations. But we will be looking at prioritizing occupancy. Exposure has flattened a bit, which is encouraging as we head into the higher exposure time of the year, so \u2013 and cautiously optimistic on our ability to hold the line.\nAustin Wurschmidt: I understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on Austin\u2019s question there, just specific to renewals, I mean, we\u2019ve seen NMHC and some of your public peers come out and say they\u2019re not going to have any rate increases on renewals, but looks like you were able to continue to push through with pretty healthy renewals in April. So first of all, how do you think about that relative to those recommendations? And then second of all, do you have a sense of what your private competition is doing in terms of renewals within your markets?\nEric Bolton: Well, Nick, this is Eric. Again, what I would say is that we are absolutely committed to helping those people that need help that have been financially impacted by this pandemic, and we really believe that the best way to help those people who need help is to expect the other aspects of our operation to perform as they should or as expected to the extent possible. And so what we elected to do is take this a month at a time. Conditions have changed radically in the last 60 days, and going out and making a 90-day commitment and taking kind of a shotgun approach and applying it to everybody just seem to be \u2013 to us to be not the right way to go.And in the end, as I say, we don\u2019t think it allows us to be as helpful as we could be to everybody that really does need help, so we elected to take more of a rifle shot approach and take a more measured approach on kind of a month-to-month basis.The other thing I would throw in that I think is important to keep in mind is that we have a lot of confidence in our pricing platform and our pricing system. If you \u2013 obviously, you recall. I mean we have the luxury of having been through a couple of pretty big mergers in the last few years, companies that were operating on the same system that we were operating on, in the same markets that we were operating on. We\u2019ve learned a lot through that process.And we have a very active, very hands-on approach to how we think about pricing, and therefore, we think that, that system and all the input variables that drive those recommendations ought to be allowed to play out. And if our system suggests that all the conditions that we\u2019re looking at today support the ability to put through some level of rent increase, we\u2019re going to allow the system to do its thing.Now having said that, in this environment, we\u2019re also very quick to provide ample space for our on-site folks to negotiate, we do not, in this environment, want to lose people that we don\u2019t really need to from a perspective relating to a rent increase. So we do negotiate at some level. But I think when you put all that together, it sort of drives the result that we have, and that\u2019s really how we think about it.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then just the other part was on what your private competition is doing. Do you have a sense that they\u2019re also increasing renewals?\nEric Bolton: Be honest with you, I don\u2019t know what the private guys are doing. We\u2019ve not heard any comments. I mean, we monitor our comps very, very actively as part of our revenue management practices, and I\u2019m certain, in some cases, there are some that are not putting through increases and some are. But it all factors into our pricing dynamic and market factors.\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. And Nick, I would just say, based on industry conversation here and there with private peers, it\u2019s the mix that Eric outlines.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nSumit Sharma: This is Sumit in for Nick. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, focusing on expenses a bit. What drivers do you have to keep the costs at Q1 levels? Because I know you mentioned that you\u2019re looking at expense growth, which is still in line with \u2013 both in line with prior guidance or prior trends. And you mentioned an increase in marketing spend, while some of your peers are actually reporting the opposite. So I just wanted to get a sense of how should we think about your expense growth for this year versus what you had stated earlier in the year?\nAlbert Campbell: This is Al. I\u2019ll give you a few comments on that, and Tom may want to give something on the marketing as well. But for the first quarter, as you mentioned, I think the 2 areas, the biggest increase of all was really \u2013 that made the biggest impact was property taxes is over 1/3 of our costs. And so as we talked about going into the year, that played out as expected. It grew 3.5%. Marketing also grew about 11% as you saw in the release, almost 12%. But as a dollar value, it\u2019s much smaller, the overall expense structure, so really had less of overall impact. And Tom can talk about what our plans are there.As we look at the rest of the year, as we talked about a little bit in the comments, we expect \u2013 hard to know exactly what\u2019s going to happen this year certainly, but expenses are \u2013 we would expect to have less of an impact certainly than revenues. And largely, we expect our costs to be close to what we projected at the beginning of the year. The 2 major items are personnel and taxes in terms of size, and we don\u2019t see any reason right now that they would be significantly out of line of what our expectations were.And we also expect some of our repair and maintenance costs or turn costs, if you would, maybe to be favorable, because fewer people will leave us. And then offsetting that, we mentioned a bit in the comments was the marketing costs because of the competitive environment and maybe a little bit of utilities costs, because people are with us and they\u2019re sheltering at home and those kind of things. But Tom, do you have anything to add?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. I would just add on the operating side of the opportunities. As Al touched on R&M, we\u2019ll probably see some relief as turnover lowers. And then as our self-touring platform gets into place and gets moving, we really understand what implications that has for efficiency, there may be some opportunity there. Marketing, as Al mentioned, is a lower dollar amount, but we\u2019re going to be competitive in the paid search area. It\u2019s probably never more important to be active in that area and I don\u2019t see an opportunity for savings in that area.\nSumit Sharma: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nHardik Goel: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As we think about the full year on the pricing power front, you guys mentioned sending out renewals around the 4% range. So would that mean that those are the renewals that will get booked in May and June? And is there a negotiation that happens where you don\u2019t actually book the 4%, you book something lower? Or is that a good bogey for what May and June renewals will look like?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. We do some negotiation as that comes out, but it\u2019s generally between 50 and 80 basis points.\nHardik Goel: Got it. And just on the new lease front, what is the prospect on that becoming a positive number? How long does that take? Is that something that can snap back quickly in \u2013 by 4Q? And I know it\u2019s really difficult, because we don\u2019t know how the economy will recover. But right now we\u2019re seeing some negative numbers, and I\u2019m just wondering how to think about that.\nThomas Grimes: No. It is \u2013 it can be fairly responsive. I mean new lease rate is sensitive. So if the economy recovers quickly, that will shift to positive quite quickly, especially if it happens over the summer months if the economy is slower to get going, but that will stay negative for a period of time. And it\u2019s really just a function of the economy, and I don\u2019t have the goggles to see exactly how that\u2019s going to play out right now. But it is sensitive, and if it comes back, we will see it and we will adjust.\nHardik Goel: Thanks so much. And lastly, if you indulge me for just one more, are you offering flexible lease terms on renewals? Or are you being careful about how your rent roll gets impacted? People want to move to a 3-month lease or 2-month lease. What are the options?\nThomas Grimes: The options are multiple. As Eric mentioned, we\u2019ve got a pretty sophisticated approach to this, and we price our units to really guide folks to the right term that fits with our lease exploration guideline. So it was more beneficial for them to rent in a month, where we have capacity in it, and it is more expensive to rent in a month that has less capacity. And they have quite a few options at renewal. And they can sort of \u2013 they can decide what\u2019s best for them, and that generally guides to what\u2019s best for us.\nHardik Goel: Got it. Thanks so much.\nThomas Grimes: You bet.\nOperator: Next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJohn Guinee: Great. Thank you. I\u2019m just looking at your development page. Have you, it might be too early, but have you re-underwritten your expected yield on costs and adjusting for expected, maybe a modest decrease in asking rents during lease-up?\nBradley Hill: Yeah. This is Brad, John. No. At this point, we\u2019ve not adjusted anything on our development underwriting at the moment. I think it\u2019s really just too early to tell on that frankly. The average period of stabilization for our deals is a couple of years out. So we\u2019ve got some time on our development platform, really, to see how, as Tom said, the economy goes, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to affect our yields on those deals. So at this point, we\u2019ve not adjusted anything there, and we think that our original underwriting is still intact given the amount of time that we have on these deals before we start hitting our lease-up periods.\nJohn Guinee: So thinking about, say, The Greene in Greenville, South Carolina or Copper Ridge in Fort Worth, you\u2019re still essentially \u2013 the same asking rents exist today that existed 3 months ago.\nBradley Hill: We\u2019re in line on those 2 properties, but I think it is worth monitoring.\nJohn Guinee: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I think, Eric, you said that in April \u2013 or maybe it was Tom, in April that your leasing activity is up 6% year-over-year. Did I hear that correctly?\nThomas Grimes: Not for April, Rich. This is Tom. But for the last couple of weeks, it is now \u2013 our leasing is about 6% over prior year\u2019s levels, yes. But not for the entire month.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. So how the heck is that happening? Sorry to put it that way. But I mean, you\u2019re obviously operating with much fewer resources. How do you explain that?\nThomas Grimes: It\u2019s a change in our behavior, and I think it\u2019s a change in our customers\u2019 behavior. And I suspected there\u2019s a little bit of a recovery where it was down close to 50% in late March. So Rich, we\u2019ve really shifted the entire \u2013 our offices are staffed, but have been closed to the public in terms of visitors. But our teams are there to facilitate both virtual and self-tours, and that there has been incredible response to that. Our conversion ratios on the self-tours are very, very good as you would expect, but it\u2019s really just changing from probably a customer preference and gearing towards guided tours first to virtual and self-tours first, and those have gone quite well.\nRichard Anderson: Has the fact that you\u2019ve had a lot more tenant retention also aided that number?\nThomas Grimes: I mean, those 2 numbers are standalone. That\u2019s helped us hold the line. Our leasing is up. Then move-ins will come up, and we\u2019ve got a chance to sort of stabilize from there. But in the sense of, if fewer people give notice, we have fewer to lease, that is a good thing. But the 6% increase in leasing is really just on volume of new leases and is not related to the amount of turnover.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. In terms of the sending out renewals at, I think it was 4% for future, we saw it, this month and next, how has been the response to that? I mean, I imagine in this environment, your tenants are expecting some handouts or what have you. Has there been some eye rolling? Or is it \u2013 it\u2019s sort of like, okay, we get it type of response. I\u2019m just curious, practically speaking, how is that\u2026?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. Well, I mean, first, and as Eric outlined in some earlier comments, we\u2019re working really hard to identify who\u2019s affected by COVID. We\u2019re seeking them out. We are working with them, and we are doing everything we can to support them. So that group is being taken care of in that manner. On the response to the renewal offers in general, for May, June and early look in July, our accept rates are running 3.5 to 4 percentage points higher than this time last year, and so the response is, frankly, pretty good. Again, we are going directly to those folks affected by COVID by asking \u2013 trying to identify and working with them. And then the other folks are responding to the offers quite well.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Great. In terms of the commentary around a lot of your states starting the process of opening up and getting the economy moving, are you \u2013 but there are a lot of businesses behind that, that are going by their own rules and perhaps delaying out of abundance of caution or whatever. How will you as a company in that region respond? Will you just follow the guidelines of the states? Or do you have your own kind of more conservative approach to opening up, so to speak, your businesses?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. We are \u2013 it is different by market what is accepted and what is guided, and we are adjusting by market. Most of our leasing offices are opening this week for guided tours under sort of strict guidelines, social distancing, crowd kind of control, if you will, belt and stanchion, those kind of items. And then the amenities are really following the local guidance, and I would expect amenities to be opened by the end of May in most of the Sunbelt locations.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Last question for me. And this promise to pay sort of payment plan, 1.3% in April, how formalized is that? I mean are they signing something and that gives \u2013 lends itself to perhaps more certainty? Or is this sort of like \u2013 I don\u2019t know, like a pinky swear type of thing?\nThomas Grimes: No, no.\nEric Bolton: It\u2019s an agreement. It\u2019s an amendment to the lease. It\u2019s an executed legal document.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Okay. Wonderful. Thanks very much, everyone.\nOperator: Going next to Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nZachary Silverberg: Hi. Thanks you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Rich\u2019s. How high do you think retention can go? And how much benefit do you think that can have to the revenue and expense side?\nThomas Grimes: I mean there\u2019s what I hope for and what I know, and it is difficult to estimate. We\u2019re in a time period where rules that were normal have changed, and we\u2019ve just got to wait and see.\nEric Bolton: Well \u2013 and I think what you have to recognize is when you start thinking about the reasons that people leave us, the number 1 reason people leave us is, because they make a decision to go buy a home. And we certainly think that, that reason is less of a pressure point today for all the sort of broad economic worries that are out there. That\u2019s unlikely to be ramping up anytime soon. But another big reason, and frankly, what has been slightly ahead of even people moving to buy a home lately, has been because of a change in their job, employment status change.And I think that, that continues to probably be the variable that will be the most impactful in terms of changing turnover behavior. And again, given the uncertainty in the economy, broadly right now, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a lot of job hopping going around. I mean, certainly, those that have jobs are probably glad to have them and going to hold on to them.The third biggest reason people leave us is, because they didn\u2019t want to pay the rent increase. And frankly, what we\u2019ve been doing is backing off on that as we\u2019ve been talking about here. So I think when you start to look at all the reasons behind it, it \u2013 we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re going to continue to see turnovers stay fairly low for some time. I think we\u2019re going to have to see the economy really start to pick up before we begin to see turnover return back to where it was. And how low it goes or how high retention goes or how low turnover goes is kind of hard to say right now.\nThomas Grimes: To add a data point to Eric\u2019s commentary, April turnover was down 8%. That was driven by a 13% decrease in job transfer.\nZachary Silverberg: Got it. Got it. I appreciate the color. And just one more. Can you guys speak to any \u2013 or have you seen any benefits from your investments in technology in either the operations or leasing side? And then does this sort of prove any future ramp-up in investment or underwriting?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. No, I mean the overhaul platform has performed quite well, and we\u2019re thrilled with that progress. I think the place that it points to, though, the most is continued self-touring and automation on the sales side of things. Our teams are handling that process quite well, and we would expect that to continue to develop at a good clip.\nZachary Silverberg: That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you. Al, do you have any early reads on how municipalities are going to be approaching property tax assessments in the next 12 to 24 months? And are they going to back off or are they just \u2013 are they going to keep coming for their money?\nAlbert Campbell: No, it\u2019s a great question, John. We spent a lot of time trying to try to dig into that, and what we\u2019re seeing right now is it\u2019s just too early to tell. We are seeing \u2013 obviously, for us, the main states are Texas, Florida and Georgia. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is most \u2013 some of the states, Texas, most prominently is pointing back to the assessments for taxes that are set beginning of the year, January 1. And the pandemic, most people are saying right now, doesn\u2019t apply for a change in that. So for 2020, they\u2019re going to stick to those plans, and any changes will roll through 2021.And we certainly expect there will be some pressure on that from people. There will also be pressure from states and localities trying to get their budgets balanced. So I think what we would say is 2020 is probably not going to change much from what our early expectations are. But as we roll into 2021, if economic impact continues to persist and revenues continue to climb, you\u2019ll likely see some impact.And what we did see in the last downturn, we went back and looked, was in the states that are biggest, Florida, Texas, Georgia, we did see, ultimately, those guys gave pretty good reprieve, but it took 6 months to a year. It took the next cycle for them to do that. And so, long story short, I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see this time.\nJohn Pawlowski: Got it. That makes sense. And then, last one for me. I\u2019m trying to get a sense for what your guys\u2019 pricing power or cash collections would look like in a world without this fiscal stimulus cranking. And so, any sense from late March or early April \u2013 I know it\u2019s very tough to extrapolate weekly data points. But any sense for any guesses of what April occupancy or cash collections would have looked like without the unemployment insurance benefits hitting and some other fiscal stimulus measures?\nEric Bolton: Well, I think \u2013 John, this is Eric. I think what you have to recognize is that, frankly, a lot of our region of the country was slower to shut down than what you see happening in lot of other areas of the country. And it\u2019s also showing signs of opening up faster. So we didn\u2019t really see the unemployment claims starting to trend up until really well into April and across a number of our states.And when you look at the kind of weight our performance \u2013 of our portfolio of states, if you will, we continue to run at unemployment claims as a percentage of the employment base that at percentages lower than national average. And so, I think that while certainly the unemployment claims ramped up starting in sort of mid-April, over the last part of April has been helpful.I think that \u2013 we don\u2019t think that that factor has been a huge tailwind for us. Certainly, it has helped. But the other thing to keep in mind is that average rent to income of our portfolio at 20%, it\u2019s a pretty affordable region of the country to live in, and dollar goes a lot further in our region of the country. And so, I think that \u2013 we think that while certainly there\u2019s been some benefit from some of these federal assistance programs, I would suggest that it\u2019s not a huge tailwind for us.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steve Brunner with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteven Brunner: Hey, guys. Just a quick question about some of the redevelopment you\u2019re doing. In the earnings document, you call out the 10 properties you\u2019re currently working on. Five of which you\u2019re \u2013 looks like you\u2019re going through with, but the other 5 you\u2019re putting on hold it looks like. Are there any indications or any sort of benchmarks you guys are looking for, for when you\u2019re going to restart or start working on those 5 properties? Or conversely, any indicators which would sort of incentivize you to push those out until next year?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a total of 10 properties in \u2013 or actually be working forward with 8 of those where we feel like the price-to-value gap we can still narrow in those markets. Even with pressure on the newer stuff in the high end. They\u2019re in great locations where we\u2019re on price/value alternative, and we can still make a difference.It will also \u2013 they\u2019ll be delivering and finishing in the late fourth quarter, early first quarter of next year. We feel good about how they\u2019re coming. That pipeline of opportunity of, sort of, let\u2019s say, late 2000, early \u2013 or late 1990s, early 2000s product, that is extremely well positioned. We feel like that pipeline goes well beyond these 10. And we will be underwriting and looking for the next round as we move into 2021.\nSteven Brunner: So just to confirm, it looks like you\u2019re pretty much going to go through with 8 out of those 10, even worst-case scenario this year. And those other 2, I guess, you\u2019re just waiting to be opportunistic with what\u2019s going on in the...\nThomas Grimes: Yeah, we were just frozen on those 2. They\u2019ll likely tee up, honestly, in early 2021.\nSteven Brunner: Perfect. Thanks so much. That\u2019s all I got.\nThomas Grimes: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRichard Skidmore: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First, just on the demand trends in late April and May, and with your markets starting to open, are you seeing anything that would suggest migration out of urban to more suburban relative to the COVID pandemic?\nThomas Grimes: I think there is anecdotal evidence for that, and we would expect that. But with such an early pickup and where our leasing is coming from, it\u2019s difficult to get that read. We\u2019ll have a better look at that in shifts as we finish the second quarter and the busy leasing season.\nRichard Skidmore: Got it. Understood. And then just following up on Texas specifically, are you seeing anything with regards to what\u2019s happening in the energy patch and how it might impact your markets in Texas? It looks like first quarter was actually pretty strong for you in Texas, but anything new on the margin in April and May?\nThomas Grimes: We were monitoring Houston. That had a little bit higher level of requests for COVID-affected jobs there. And we\u2019re watching oil and gas there. And that is a bit of a worry for us. But Austin and Dallas are hanging in there with the portfolio. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to a follow-up from Hardik Goel with Zelman. Please go ahead.\nHardik Goel: Hey, guys. Just really quick, can you just give us more color on the way traffic is calculated? Does it include the online traffic and the virtual tour traffic? And as a comparison, what would traffic be for the last couple of weeks with just the physical traffic being counted?\nThomas Grimes: Yeah. No, it\u2019s moved around a little bit. So what we have is leads, which is an expressed interest. We have traffic or visits, which is actually a physical visit to the property. And then we have leases, which is someone who signed an application. There\u2019s been a lot of moving around in that. So what I would tell you is leads and move-ins dipped as I outlined in late March. And leads and move-ins have grown, have recovered to above 6% of normal levels.Traffic, which is visits to the property, has remained relatively low, because more of our leases are being executed by virtual or self-touring, but primarily virtual. So our closing ratio, which we used to think of as a method of visits to lease, we thought 20% is good. We\u2019re running 56% to 70% on that, because if you\u2019re coming out to see us at this point, there\u2019s a very good chance that you will close.So I think we\u2019re kind of monitoring the lead side of it. And we\u2019re monitoring, are we actually getting leases. Traffic or visits is a number that has less meaning today than it did 6 months ago.\nEric Bolton: We will certainly expect, now that our leasing offices are opening back up the doors this week, we expect on-site visits to really start to ramp up. They\u2019ve been nonexistent for the last few weeks, because the doors were locked, and we were doing it all virtual. But as the doors are opening up this week, we think the traffic levels will start to pick up.\nHardik Goel: So that\u2019s great color. Thank you so much.\nEric Bolton: You bet.\nOperator: And it does appear we have no further questions. I\u2019ll return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Well, we appreciate everyone joining us, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking to a number of you virtually for our upcoming June meetings with NAREIT, so thank you very much.\nOperator: And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Grimes",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll offer a short recap on the first quarter and then move to trends that we have seen in April and May. First quarter of 2020 exceeded our expectations, and the results for the quarter put us in a strong position entering this disruptive COVID-19 period.Effective rents were up 4.2% and blended lease-over-lease pricing, including concessions, was up 2.6%, which was in line with seasonal expectations. Occupancy remained strong at 95.7%. Before shelter-in-place began in mid-March, occupancy was 95.9%, and our 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, was just 7.6%. This was 40 basis points better than last year.In short, we headed into the COVID-19 disruption with strong occupancy, low 60-day exposure and good embedded rent growth. During the quarter, we completed 1,440 interior redevelopment units and upgraded 8,017 units with our SmartHome technology package. We felt it was prudent to pause both of these programs in March. We'll monitor demand for these 2 programs and return to production when appropriate.Moving on to April and May trends. Historically, April is a month of accelerating pricing growth as we move into the higher demand season of the year. As you will note from our lease-over-lease pricing, which includes concessions information listed in the supplemental data, you'll notice this year did not follow that trend.New lease, leasing volume dropped 43% lower than prior year in the last week of March. However, the last 3 weeks, leasing volume has rebounded and is 6% higher than prior year levels. Our teams have been effective at using our virtual and self-tour platform. We expect these practices to be further augmented by guided tours in May.As expected, our current residents are choosing to stay with us, and our resident retention plans are positive. Turnover for the month of April was down 8% versus April of last year. May, June and July renewal acceptance rates are all running ahead of last year at this time.We have worked diligently to identify and support those who need help as a result of COVID-19. 1.3% of our April billed rent is on a 60-day plan to pay, it was established to aid those who are impacted by COVID-19. In addition to flexible payment plans for those affected by COVID-19, we have not charged late fees, frozen eviction proceedings and actively work to pair affected residents with local and national support resources. These changes will cause our late fee income to be lower than expected in the second quarter.Collections have been a focus. In April, we have collected 98% of rent billed for April. When you add the 1.3% of COVID-19 resident \u2013 affected resident payment plans that were mentioned earlier, we've accounted for 99.3% of April's billed rent. This is in line with prior year results.May rent payment trends are slightly ahead of April's patterns. As of May 5, we have collected or executed payment plans for 94.2% of our May billed rent as compared to 92.6% of cash collections and executed payment plans at the same point in April.I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They've served and cared for our residents and associates well as we've grappled with the constantly changing implications of COVID-19. I'm proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. Brad? John, you were a little blurred on the first question. Was it on the May delinquency; is the run rate what we expect to continue? I wouldn't say it's a good run rate for the remainder of the year, but I think April and May are running pretty similar to each other at this point. Really, the run rate for the remainder of the year depends on how rapidly the economy recovers from the COVID-19. Yeah, I'll give you, Neil \u2013 this is Tom \u2013 just sort of a broad brush. As far as the request came in, they were a little higher in places that are affected by tourism, such as Orlando, Savannah and Charleston. They were as high as $7 million in requests, but $5 million of that has been paid off at this point.On asset quality, we're not seeing any difference at all. A is paid at 98.1% cash with 1.3% deferred and Bs were 97.9% with 1.3% deferred. So really on an asset class basis, and honestly, if you look at it by suburban-urban or high-rise looking at mid-rise or a garden, those are fairly consistent. The differentiation really comes by market characteristic. What we've seen \u2013 we made that shift pretty quickly. We saw a falloff in move-ins in late March that has recovered. And we have \u2013 our demand metrics are pretty good right now, right. Austin, what I'd say, but I would say we're treading water at this point. We've got enough demand to hold on. And then it really just depends on how the economy shakes out, and that will be \u2013 that will vary across the Sunbelt based on locations. But we will be looking at prioritizing occupancy. Exposure has flattened a bit, which is encouraging as we head into the higher exposure time of the year, so \u2013 and cautiously optimistic on our ability to hold the line. Yeah. And Nick, I would just say, based on industry conversation here and there with private peers, it's the mix that Eric outlines. Yeah. I would just add on the operating side of the opportunities. As Al touched on R&M, we'll probably see some relief as turnover lowers. And then as our self-touring platform gets into place and gets moving, we really understand what implications that has for efficiency, there may be some opportunity there. Marketing, as Al mentioned, is a lower dollar amount, but we're going to be competitive in the paid search area. It's probably never more important to be active in that area and I don't see an opportunity for savings in that area. Yeah. We do some negotiation as that comes out, but it's generally between 50 and 80 basis points. No. It is \u2013 it can be fairly responsive. I mean new lease rate is sensitive. So if the economy recovers quickly, that will shift to positive quite quickly, especially if it happens over the summer months if the economy is slower to get going, but that will stay negative for a period of time. And it's really just a function of the economy, and I don't have the goggles to see exactly how that's going to play out right now. But it is sensitive, and if it comes back, we will see it and we will adjust. The options are multiple. As Eric mentioned, we've got a pretty sophisticated approach to this, and we price our units to really guide folks to the right term that fits with our lease exploration guideline. So it was more beneficial for them to rent in a month, where we have capacity in it, and it is more expensive to rent in a month that has less capacity. And they have quite a few options at renewal. And they can sort of \u2013 they can decide what's best for them, and that generally guides to what's best for us. You bet. Not for April, Rich. This is Tom. But for the last couple of weeks, it is now \u2013 our leasing is about 6% over prior year's levels, yes. But not for the entire month. It's a change in our behavior, and I think it's a change in our customers' behavior. And I suspected there's a little bit of a recovery where it was down close to 50% in late March. So Rich, we've really shifted the entire \u2013 our offices are staffed, but have been closed to the public in terms of visitors. But our teams are there to facilitate both virtual and self-tours, and that there has been incredible response to that. Our conversion ratios on the self-tours are very, very good as you would expect, but it's really just changing from probably a customer preference and gearing towards guided tours first to virtual and self-tours first, and those have gone quite well. I mean, those 2 numbers are standalone. That's helped us hold the line. Our leasing is up. Then move-ins will come up, and we've got a chance to sort of stabilize from there. But in the sense of, if fewer people give notice, we have fewer to lease, that is a good thing. But the 6% increase in leasing is really just on volume of new leases and is not related to the amount of turnover. Yeah. Well, I mean, first, and as Eric outlined in some earlier comments, we're working really hard to identify who's affected by COVID. We're seeking them out. We are working with them, and we are doing everything we can to support them. So that group is being taken care of in that manner. On the response to the renewal offers in general, for May, June and early look in July, our accept rates are running 3.5 to 4 percentage points higher than this time last year, and so the response is, frankly, pretty good. Again, we are going directly to those folks affected by COVID by asking \u2013 trying to identify and working with them. And then the other folks are responding to the offers quite well. Yeah. We are \u2013 it is different by market what is accepted and what is guided, and we are adjusting by market. Most of our leasing offices are opening this week for guided tours under sort of strict guidelines, social distancing, crowd kind of control, if you will, belt and stanchion, those kind of items. And then the amenities are really following the local guidance, and I would expect amenities to be opened by the end of May in most of the Sunbelt locations. No, no. I mean there's what I hope for and what I know, and it is difficult to estimate. We're in a time period where rules that were normal have changed, and we've just got to wait and see. To add a data point to Eric's commentary, April turnover was down 8%. That was driven by a 13% decrease in job transfer. Yeah. No, I mean the overhaul platform has performed quite well, and we're thrilled with that progress. I think the place that it points to, though, the most is continued self-touring and automation on the sales side of things. Our teams are handling that process quite well, and we would expect that to continue to develop at a good clip. Yeah. I think it's a total of 10 properties in \u2013 or actually be working forward with 8 of those where we feel like the price-to-value gap we can still narrow in those markets. Even with pressure on the newer stuff in the high end. They're in great locations where we're on price/value alternative, and we can still make a difference.It will also \u2013 they'll be delivering and finishing in the late fourth quarter, early first quarter of next year. We feel good about how they're coming. That pipeline of opportunity of, sort of, let's say, late 2000, early \u2013 or late 1990s, early 2000s product, that is extremely well positioned. We feel like that pipeline goes well beyond these 10. And we will be underwriting and looking for the next round as we move into 2021. Yeah, we were just frozen on those 2. They'll likely tee up, honestly, in early 2021. Great. Thank you. I think there is anecdotal evidence for that, and we would expect that. But with such an early pickup and where our leasing is coming from, it's difficult to get that read. We'll have a better look at that in shifts as we finish the second quarter and the busy leasing season. We were monitoring Houston. That had a little bit higher level of requests for COVID-affected jobs there. And we're watching oil and gas there. And that is a bit of a worry for us. But Austin and Dallas are hanging in there with the portfolio. Thank you. Yeah. No, it's moved around a little bit. So what we have is leads, which is an expressed interest.

So what I would tell you is leads and move-ins dipped as I outlined in late March.

We're running 56% to 70% on that, because if you're coming out to see us at this point, there's a very good chance that you will close.So I think we're kind of monitoring the lead side of it. And we're monitoring, are we actually getting leases. Traffic or visits is a number that has less meaning today than it did 6 months ago."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and thanks to all of you on the call this morning for joining us. I know it's a busy day of earnings reports. So we'll keep our comments brief and get to your questions. I'd like to start by offering my appreciation and thanks to the hard-working associates at MAA.I especially want to thank our associates serving at our properties and working directly with our residents. Your dedication and commitment to supporting and serving our residents has been on full display over the past few weeks and has never been more important than it is today. I'm proud of work you're doing and the service that you're providing.As noted in our earnings release, first quarter results were better than expected with solid rent growth and strong same-store performance. Our comments this morning, however, will focus on April performance and early May trends. We're encouraged by the solid performance in rent collection for April as well as the early trends in May.We've taken a proactive approach to directly assist and support those residents who are financially impacted by the shutdown of the economy, while also working to ensure that all other residents in various aspects of our operations are performing and functioning as expected. Given the severe pullback in the economy and the associated job losses, leasing conditions deteriorated beginning in late March.This is particularly evident in our leasing trends as it applies to new move-in residents. On the other hand, we're seeing positive trends associated with our existing residents electing to stay put and resident turnover continues to decline. Overall, we would expect these leasing conditions to persist over the next 2 to 3 months.As you know, the reopening of local economies and businesses across our Sunbelt markets is now underway. Given the range of protocols being used by various states and cities to reopen their economies, it will be a choppy process. However, with unemployment claims across the majority of our states currently running below national averages, coupled with the active efforts underway to reopen across the Sunbelt, we're hopeful that leasing conditions will start to improve later this year.As efforts to reopen Sunbelt economies are just now getting underway, it's difficult at the moment to gauge the pace at which employment conditions will improve. We hope to gain better visibility on the important underlying economic and employment market conditions during the second quarter and be in a more informed position as to the outlook for the remainder of the year when we report second quarter results.In the meantime, we're confident that our strategy focused on the appealing Sunbelt markets, supported by our strong operating platform and our strong balance sheet, executed by a cycle-tested and proven team of associates, will enable MAA to continue to successfully navigate this down-cycle.That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll turn the call over to Tom. And in answer to your second part of your question, the renewal performance, renewal pricing performance is pretty consistent throughout the markets in the portfolio. There's really no difference there. Well, Neil, this is Eric. I would tell you that it starts with a principle that we really want to help those people who need help. And I think one of the best ways that you help people that really need help is you also expect that the other aspects of your operation perform as they should and as they're capable of. And so, what we've attempted to do here is to be very proactive at communicating with our residents and reaching out actively to those that need help and \u2013 but also making sure that people understand that this is a program that's intended to help those who truly need help.The other thing that we opted to do is really take more of a rifle shot approach to the market environment we find ourselves in. And rather than come out early when conditions were really just a lot unknown at the time and just suggest that we're going to treat everybody in the same way with these following programs, we really elected to instead take it sort of month by month, approach it on a case-by-case basis in some cases, which gives us the ability to adapt and change as conditions evolve.And so, I think we took a very measured approach to things, and a lot of communication went on with residents and with our associates at the properties. And I think through all that, it resulted in a collection performance that we feel pretty good about. Well, Nick, this is Eric. Again, what I would say is that we are absolutely committed to helping those people that need help that have been financially impacted by this pandemic, and we really believe that the best way to help those people who need help is to expect the other aspects of our operation to perform as they should or as expected to the extent possible. And so what we elected to do is take this a month at a time. Conditions have changed radically in the last 60 days, and going out and making a 90-day commitment and taking kind of a shotgun approach and applying it to everybody just seem to be \u2013 to us to be not the right way to go.And in the end, as I say, we don't think it allows us to be as helpful as we could be to everybody that really does need help, so we elected to take more of a rifle shot approach and take a more measured approach on kind of a month-to-month basis.The other thing I would throw in that I think is important to keep in mind is that we have a lot of confidence in our pricing platform and our pricing system. If you \u2013 obviously, you recall. I mean we have the luxury of having been through a couple of pretty big mergers in the last few years, companies that were operating on the same system that we were operating on, in the same markets that we were operating on. We've learned a lot through that process.And we have a very active, very hands-on approach to how we think about pricing, and therefore, we think that, that system and all the input variables that drive those recommendations ought to be allowed to play out. And if our system suggests that all the conditions that we're looking at today support the ability to put through some level of rent increase, we're going to allow the system to do its thing.Now having said that, in this environment, we're also very quick to provide ample space for our on-site folks to negotiate, we do not, in this environment, want to lose people that we don't really need to from a perspective relating to a rent increase. So we do negotiate at some level. But I think when you put all that together, it sort of drives the result that we have, and that's really how we think about it. Be honest with you, I don't know what the private guys are doing. We've not heard any comments. I mean, we monitor our comps very, very actively as part of our revenue management practices, and I'm certain, in some cases, there are some that are not putting through increases and some are. But it all factors into our pricing dynamic and market factors. It's an agreement. It's an amendment to the lease. It's an executed legal document. Well \u2013 and I think what you have to recognize is when you start thinking about the reasons that people leave us, the number 1 reason people leave us is, because they make a decision to go buy a home. And we certainly think that, that reason is less of a pressure point today for all the sort of broad economic worries that are out there. That's unlikely to be ramping up anytime soon. But another big reason, and frankly, what has been slightly ahead of even people moving to buy a home lately, has been because of a change in their job, employment status change.And I think that, that continues to probably be the variable that will be the most impactful in terms of changing turnover behavior. And again, given the uncertainty in the economy, broadly right now, I don't think there's going to be a lot of job hopping going around. I mean, certainly, those that have jobs are probably glad to have them and going to hold on to them.The third biggest reason people leave us is, because they didn't want to pay the rent increase. And frankly, what we've been doing is backing off on that as we've been talking about here. So I think when you start to look at all the reasons behind it, it \u2013 we're optimistic that we're going to continue to see turnovers stay fairly low for some time. I think we're going to have to see the economy really start to pick up before we begin to see turnover return back to where it was. And how low it goes or how high retention goes or how low turnover goes is kind of hard to say right now. Well, I think \u2013 John, this is Eric. I think what you have to recognize is that, frankly, a lot of our region of the country was slower to shut down than what you see happening in lot of other areas of the country. And it's also showing signs of opening up faster. So we didn't really see the unemployment claims starting to trend up until really well into April and across a number of our states.And when you look at the kind of weight our performance \u2013 of our portfolio of states, if you will, we continue to run at unemployment claims as a percentage of the employment base that at percentages lower than national average. And so, I think that while certainly the unemployment claims ramped up starting in sort of mid-April, over the last part of April has been helpful.I think that \u2013 we don't think that that factor has been a huge tailwind for us. Certainly, it has helped. But the other thing to keep in mind is that average rent to income of our portfolio at 20%, it's a pretty affordable region of the country to live in, and dollar goes a lot further in our region of the country. And so, I think that \u2013 we think that while certainly there's been some benefit from some of these federal assistance programs, I would suggest that it's not a huge tailwind for us. We will certainly expect, now that our leasing offices are opening back up the doors this week, we expect on-site visits to really start to ramp up. They've been nonexistent for the last few weeks, because the doors were locked, and we were doing it all virtual. But as the doors are opening up this week, we think the traffic levels will start to pick up. You bet. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us, and I'm sure we'll be talking to a number of you virtually for our upcoming June meetings with NAREIT, so thank you very much."

            "name": "Albert Campbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some brief commentary on the company's recent earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. While the main focus of the call this morning is on April performance and May trends, it is important to remember that we did have a strong first quarter performance.Our reported core FFO for the first quarter of $1.62 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was essentially evenly split between favorable operations, primarily revenues and other items below NOI, primarily favorable interest expense for the quarter.Given the significant economic uncertainty related to COVID-19, we formally withdrew our guidance in March and don't yet have enough clarity to reestablish full year guidance. But to provide as much information about current trends as we could, we added a COVID-19 update section in our supplemental data package, Pages S11 and S12, which has a lot of information about April performance, including collections, leasing, occupancy and other key metrics and some additional very current information about our May collections.And as noted in our release for April and May, we provided flexible payment options and waived late fees for residents financially impacted by the pandemic. Thus far, we've been encouraged by April and early May cash collections both for current rent and deferred payments. But as Tom mentioned, we do expect fee performance to reflect more pressure in the near-term as partial resident payments are applied to rent first, and because we waived late fees and certain lease termination fees for impacted residents. You can find details for April fees along with historical context from this in the supplement.As Eric mentioned, our general expectation is for the current leasing conditions to persist over the next few months, continuing to impact revenue performance. However, overall, we expect operating expenses to remain fairly consistent with our original expectations as we expect 2 largest expense areas, personnel and real estate taxes, to remain near early projections for the year with some benefits expected in maintenance costs from lower turnover perhaps offset by slightly higher utilities and marketing expenses. Also below NOI, we expect overhead and interest costs to trend somewhat lower than original expectations for the year as hiring plans and short-term borrowing costs will also be impacted by the current economic environment.Finally, it's important to point out that many of the activities over the last few years to strengthen our balance sheet position us well in the current challenging environment. Our total leverage remains at a historically low level. We have a significant capacity provided by our $1 billion unsecured credit facility, which is expandable to $1.5 billion. Also, our debt maturities for 2020 are only $137 million.Our remaining development funding obligation for the year is a modest $175 million to $200 million. Although the capital markets have not fully recovered, recent transactions exhibit good access to public bonds and other forms of capital, especially for companies with strong credit metrics such as MAA. We're positioned to not only weather the current stress well but to eventually pursue opportunities that may result.Though we are committed to our long-term leverage range, given our current metrics, our rating \u2013 we expect that we could immediately invest around $750 million in quality properties funded with debt alone. For the appropriate opportunity and plan, additional capacity is likely available as well.That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Keith, we'll now turn the call over to you for questions. Well, for the vast majority \u2013 Neil, this is Al. We certainly expect, once we release our earnings for the second quarter, that we'll have a portion of \u2013 that we'll have a bad debt reserve that identifies what we think will ultimately collect on some things. Important to note that the information we put in the press release this morning was on a cash basis. It really doesn't reflect any of that.And so, anything we see in the second quarter and more flexibility will be a good thing for us. And it's also important to note that the commercial side of our business, you mentioned straight-lining, at least the commercial side of our business, is much, much smaller than the 1.5% of our revenues. And for those ones, we are taking a month and pushing it to the end of the lease like many of the commercial operators are and spreading it out over the life of the lease.But for multifamily residents, yeah, we're doing a normal collection process with a \u2013 ultimately have a bad debt reserve when we release second quarter earnings. That's exactly right. I mean, so what we're showing you is \u2013 the point I'm trying to make is the information we're showing in the release on April and on May is just gross, not collected rent at this point. 2.3% of our rent and fees together is uncollected, but from that, we have 1.3%, which is we have promises to pay, which we feel like we will collect the vast majority of them. And put us in a much better position. So when we report our earnings for the second quarter, we will have likely reported revenue for a large part of that. This is Al. I'll give you a few comments on that, and Tom may want to give something on the marketing as well. But for the first quarter, as you mentioned, I think the 2 areas, the biggest increase of all was really \u2013 that made the biggest impact was property taxes is over 1/3 of our costs. And so as we talked about going into the year, that played out as expected. It grew 3.5%. Marketing also grew about 11% as you saw in the release, almost 12%. But as a dollar value, it's much smaller, the overall expense structure, so really had less of overall impact. And Tom can talk about what our plans are there.As we look at the rest of the year, as we talked about a little bit in the comments, we expect \u2013 hard to know exactly what's going to happen this year certainly, but expenses are \u2013 we would expect to have less of an impact certainly than revenues. And largely, we expect our costs to be close to what we projected at the beginning of the year. The 2 major items are personnel and taxes in terms of size, and we don't see any reason right now that they would be significantly out of line of what our expectations were.And we also expect some of our repair and maintenance costs or turn costs, if you would, maybe to be favorable, because fewer people will leave us. And then offsetting that, we mentioned a bit in the comments was the marketing costs because of the competitive environment and maybe a little bit of utilities costs, because people are with us and they're sheltering at home and those kind of things. But Tom, do you have anything to add? No, it's a great question, John. We spent a lot of time trying to try to dig into that, and what we're seeing right now is it's just too early to tell. We are seeing \u2013 obviously, for us, the main states are Texas, Florida and Georgia. And what we're seeing right now is most \u2013 some of the states, Texas, most prominently is pointing back to the assessments for taxes that are set beginning of the year, January 1. And the pandemic, most people are saying right now, doesn't apply for a change in that. So for 2020, they're going to stick to those plans, and any changes will roll through 2021.And we certainly expect there will be some pressure on that from people. There will also be pressure from states and localities trying to get their budgets balanced. So I think what we would say is 2020 is probably not going to change much from what our early expectations are. But as we roll into 2021, if economic impact continues to persist and revenues continue to climb, you'll likely see some impact.And what we did see in the last downturn, we went back and looked, was in the states that are biggest, Florida, Texas, Georgia, we did see, ultimately, those guys gave pretty good reprieve, but it took 6 months to a year. It took the next cycle for them to do that. And so, long story short, I think that's what we'll see this time."

            "name": "Bradley Hill",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. We are certainly in unprecedented times, and the transaction market fully reflects this reality. The transaction market is generally in a wait-and-see mode, and the only transactions occurring are those that were either fully committed before COVID-19 hit with their debt and equity lined up or deals that have a strong buyer need to close, such as the 1031 exchange. Because of this slowdown in activity and in an effort to allow our associates to focus on our properties and our residents, we've elected to pause the disposition process of our Jackson, Mississippi properties, and we'll re-evaluate the sale of those assets at a later date.At this time, we have no insight into any potential cap rate changes due to the lack of activity. Going forward, due diligence processes will be extended, meaning it could be a few months before cap rates and pricing trends are more apparent. We believe the changes taking place due to COVID-19 will potentially lead to more attractive investment opportunities through each of our platforms, land sites for future ground up development, pre-purchase development where we partner with strong developers and acquisition of existing assets. It's too early to say when the opportunities will begin to materialize, but we continue to work closely with our network of brokers and developers to monitor a number of previously identified opportunities.Since the pandemic hit, new development has shut down with most developers halting all predevelopment spending and many dropping land sites. Construction debt is non-existent, forcing developers to shelf many shovel-ready projects. Due to our balance sheet strength and our available capital through our line of credit, we are receiving more calls from developers looking for capital. As we filter through all opportunities that come our way, we will remain very selective, cautious in our approach and disciplined in our underwriting. With a significant pullback in capital sources for new development, we expect new starts to decline significantly over the next few months, leading to a sharp drop in deliveries within our markets in a couple of years.With regard to the acquisition of existing assets, we continue to monitor the fundamentals in our markets with a significant focus on newly delivered assets that are still in lease-up. This segment of the market is likely to experience the most pressure as rents underperform, concessions increase and stabilization is delayed. Additionally, agencies have pulled back on their funding of non-stabilized assets, limiting the buyer pool for this segment.Finally, just a note on construction, we have been fortunate that all of the municipalities in which we operate have classified construction as an essential business, and we have seen very little impact to the construction schedule of our 7 development projects.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Al. Well, Austin, this is Brad. The calls we're getting so far are for new starts. I mean I think it's too early really to start getting calls for deals that are in lease-up, but as I indicated in my comments, I do think that there's going to be some pressure on the new lease-up segment, and we will start getting those calls. I don't know when that's going to materialize. We don't know when that's going to be.But the calls we're getting right now are from developers who thought they had their debt and equity lined up. And they're 2 months out from starting construction. And now they have no debt, they have no equity. So those are the calls we're getting right now. And as I said, we're getting a lot of those calls, because we looked at a lot of those deals originally and may be another equity source, got the deal for whatever reason.But it's too early, we think, to really kick off any of those deals. We need a little bit more time to let kind of the cloud settle around us.In terms of debt terms, they're certainly worse than they were before COVID-19 hit. I think, certainly, LTVs are down really across the board. There's additional requirements that are going to affect the proceeds that borrowers are going to get. They're looking at trailing 3 months operations, which are going to be impacted by what's going on around us, some more so than others. So that's going to affect the proceeds that folks are getting and should, as I said, lead to additional opportunities for us on the buy side.But there are additional requirements that agencies are putting on buyers that are hampering their ability to get their max proceeds right now. But the spreads have come down from the end of March, so they're not as bad as they have been. They're getting somewhat better. Well, contractors are not quick to lower their pricing. I think it's going to still take some time before we see a potential reduction in price kind of come through the system. I mean, from a sub standpoint, they still have jobs that they're working on right now. I think, certainly the new deals that they're pricing will start to trend down, but I think that's going to be a few months before you start seeing some cost reductions come through the system. It's not going to be immediate. Yeah. This is Brad, John. No. At this point, we've not adjusted anything on our development underwriting at the moment. I think it's really just too early to tell on that frankly. The average period of stabilization for our deals is a couple of years out. So we've got some time on our development platform, really, to see how, as Tom said, the economy goes, and that's really what's going to affect our yields on those deals. So at this point, we've not adjusted anything there, and we think that our original underwriting is still intact given the amount of time that we have on these deals before we start hitting our lease-up periods. We're in line on those 2 properties, but I think it is worth monitoring."

MAA wrapped up calendar year 2021 with strong momentum in rent growth, driving fourth quarter results that were ahead of expectations. The demand for apartment housing across our markets continues to grow. Comparing the pricing achieved on all the leases that went into effect during the fourth quarter on a lease-over-lease basis, rents jumped 16% as compared to the rents on expiring leases. This is 100 basis points ahead of the performance in the preceding third quarter. We are clearly carrying good momentum for continued strong rent growth in the coming year.  As outlined in our earnings guidance for 2022, we plan to take further advantage of the strong leasing environment and drive additional rent growth through unit interior upgrades and more extensive full repositioning projects at several communities. Additionally, we continue a steady rollout of a number of new technology initiatives aimed at further expanding our operating margins. We are just beginning to harvest some of the benefits of our new tech initiatives with 30 leasing positions eliminated through attrition in 2021, and another 50 leasing positions targeted to be eliminated by the end of this year.  Our new development and lease-up portfolios continue to make solid progress with leasing velocity and rents running ahead of our pro forma expectations. As Brad will outline in his comments, we have several additional new projects that we are expected to start in 2022.  The balance sheet remains a very strong position. And during the fourth quarter, Standard & Poor's moved their credit rating outlook on MAA to a positive status. Given the strong earnings performance and robust pricing being captured on property dispositions, we expect to see the balance sheet metrics improve further in 2022.  Our initial earnings guidance for 2022 outlines in more detail our expectations for continued strong performance from our existing portfolio, the expansion of our new development pipeline and our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet.  Following a 9% growth in core FFO per share in calendar year 2021, we're forecasting a 13% growth in core FFO in 2022 at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our team of MAA associates had a terrific year performance in 2021, and I very much appreciate their service to our residents and support to each other.  And that's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom to update on property operations. Tom?\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust and those trends carried into 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the fourth quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 10.1% on a year-over-year basis.  Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver, and with current blended pricing momentum we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96%.  As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we completed 6,360 interior unit upgrades and installed 23,579 Smart Home packages. This brings the total number of Smart units to 48,000. In 2022, we plan to complete a similar level of interior unit upgrades and Smart Home packages. For our repositioning programs, we're in the final stages of completing work on our first eight properties in the program and have another eight that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continued into 2022. Lease-over-lease pricing on new move-in leases for January was 15.4%, ahead of the rent on the prior lease.  Renewal lease pricing for January was running 17.1% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio was up approximately 16.3% in January. Average daily occupancy for the month of January is currently 95.9% which is 50 basis points better than January of last year.  Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. This is 60 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We're well positioned as we move into 2022. I'm grateful for our team's continued resilience and strong performance. I'm excited to see what they accomplish in 2022.  I'll now turn the call over to Brad. \nBrad Hill: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record year for multifamily transactions and the fourth quarter was no exception. We continue to see very strong asset pricing trends across our footprint with an acceleration in pricing in the fourth quarter.  Operational performance across our markets is strong, driving continued high investor demand. Bid sheets are deep, with winners surviving multiple best and final rounds and offering aggressive all around deal terms.  To date, we've seen no negative impact on asset values from expected rising interest rates and we believe the tremendous amount of liquidity coupled with continued strong rent growth expectations will drive values higher. We remain active in the transaction market and are constantly evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, particularly in a rising rate environment, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties could materialize. New development continues to provide a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital as compared to acquisitions. So we will continue to focus on growing our development pipeline.  Our pipeline ended 2021 at $460 million under construction and $242 million in lease up. As we've indicated in the past, the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions. But we remain focused on expanding our opportunity.  Later in 2022, the growth in our pipeline will be more evident as we expect to end the year with $900 million to $1 billion under construction and $300 million in lease up. Therefore, we expect our total under construction and in lease up to grow from approximately $700 million at the end of 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by the end of 2022.  This ramp up will include in-house developments at two owned sites in Denver, one of which is a three-phase site, an owned site in Tampa, and two controlled sites in Denver and Raleigh. On the pre-purchase side of our development operation, we are in predevelopment on the Salt Lake City site that we hope to start in late 2022.  Performance at communities and their initial lease up is going well. Absorption is stronger than we expected and rents on average are 5% to 13% above performance. Reflective of the strong absorption, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Novel Midtown community to first quarter '22.  All of our under construction projects remain at or below our budgeted construction costs, but we continue to see increased and broad-based material shortages and delivery delays. In addition, we've begun to see some level of labor shortages in the market.  Our construction team has done a great job navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact of schedules and the economics of our projects. But this is an area we'll need to actively monitor throughout the year.  We expect these challenges to add 60 days or so to any new starts this year, and we expect a 30-day delay at our Val Vista and Westglenn projects. We've adjusted our construction schedules as noted in the supplemental to reflect the delay at these two properties.  We had tremendous execution on our property dispositions in 2021, selling seven assets and achieving pricing well ahead of our expectations. Our fourth quarter dispositions were sold above our guidance range, generating a leveraged investment IRR of 26% for these 29-year-old assets. In 2022, we will continue our discipline pruning of the portfolio and expect to sell another four properties over the coming year.  That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al.\nAl Campbell: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Core FFO performance of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter was $0.07 per share, above the midpoint of our guidance. Producing core FFO was $7.01 per share for the full year, which, as Eric mentioned, is 9% above the prior year. That performance for the quarter is virtually all from revenue growth.  As Tom outlined, strong pricing trends continued through the fourth quarter. So no seasonal slowdown, which not only benefited the fourth quarter, but provide additional strength for 2022 expectations, which I'll talk about more in just a moment.  In total, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were essential in line with our expectations as some inflationary pressures impacted repair and maintenance costs. Real estate taxes were lower than expected due to favorable appeals and rate rollbacks finalized during the quarter.  We expect some continued inflationary pressures in our operating expenses during 2022, but we expect the impact to be more than absorbed through the continued strong revenue growth for the year. We did provide initial earnings guidance for 2022 with the release, which is detailed in a supplemental package with the release.  Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $7.92 per share at the midpoint of the range, which represents a 13% growth over the prior year. The overall backdrop for our projected 2022 performance is continued strong occupancy levels, remaining between 95.6% and 96% for the full year, providing a foundation support of continued strong growth in effective rent per unit as the strong blended lease-over-lease rent rates continue to work through our portfolio.  Effective rent growth is projected to be 10% for the year at the midpoint, which is nearly twice the total of effective rent growth posted for 2021. This result is based on continued strong blended lease rate growth through the first few quarters with some normal seasonal trends and challenging comparisons beginning to be felt late in the year, particularly during the fourth quarter. This produces projected total same-store revenue growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. As mentioned, we expect to see some inflationary pressures impacting our same-store operating expenses for the year. The personnel costs, repair maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance costs, all trending above long-term growth rates producing 5% to 6% growth overall for 2022. However, this pressure is expected to be more than offset by the strong revenue trends producing an NOI growth expectation of 10% to 12% for the year. Our forecast also assumes an active transaction year with projected development funding of 200 million to 300 million for the year and acquisitions of 75 million to 125 million. We expect a majority of this to be funded on disposition proceeds of between 300 million and 350 million. Our forecast anticipates us starting six new development projects during the year, a combination of in-house, pre-purchase deals, as outlined by Brad, which will increase our total pipeline and funding commitment as we enter 2023.  We currently have no plans to raise additional equity during the year as our forecast projects our leverage to end the year slightly below the current level with debt to EBITDA ranging 4x to 4.5x. Also virtually all of our debt is currently fixed with maturities well laddered, over 8.7 years on average, providing some protection against rising interest rates.  So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Chris, we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions.\nOperator: Certainly. . And our first question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Hi. Good morning, everyone. In terms of the guidance, I was hoping you can maybe give a little bit more detail on the 10% effective rent growth at the midpoint. Your blended lease pricing has been trending higher than that in January fourth quarter. So just trying to understand -- I know you talked about some slowing in the back half of the year, but just trying to understand how you're thinking about sort of future market rent growth on top of what you've already achieved so far?\nAl Campbell: Yes. This is Al. I could give you some color on that. And as we talked for a little bit in the comments, it's really -- it's based on a strong projection of revenue for sure. But carrying the significant strength of what you're seeing in the fourth quarter end of the year and having pricing of beginning year, as we talked about, move to the back half of the year being impacted by a couple of things, really just some normal seasonality. As we entered the back part of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we thought we'd see some seasonality really power through that. It just continued to accelerate in rent pricing. So our forecast is built on continued strong pricing, particularly in the first half of the year, beginning in the back half to feel a little bit of normal seasonality and then hitting those tough comps that we saw from the fourth quarter. So I wouldn't say that we project a weakness at all, we're just projecting a couple of things that come back to sort of normality in the back part of the year. I think that's -- we felt like that was a prudent forecast for the year.\nNick Yulico: Okay, that's helpful. I guess just on the renewal piece of that. Maybe you can give us a feel for, again, you've been pushing renewals at well over 10%. So at what point does that sort of slow down you think this year?\nAl Campbell: I'll give you overall, and if some of these other guys want to jump in here. But what I'm saying is first to forecast, we build our forecast often blended, first and foremost, because that's really -- that drives obviously the economic portion of the forecast. And so how it falls out from renewals to new leases where we don't focus specifically on the forecast other than I would say the underlying belief expectation is that you'll see renewals be pretty steady through the year. That's where you'll see the strength continue to market that we're seeing right now continue. If we see the seasonality that we're talking about in new comps, you'll feel that more in new lease pricing. So I hesitate to give too much details there, because we're focused on blended. I think that's the most important number. But that's how we think about it. And we've laid it out in our forecast as you'll see that, those two normalizing factors hit the new pricing on the year.\nNick Yulico: Okay, thanks. Just one last quick one is if you had any latest move-in data into your portfolio from stats from areas outside of the Sunbelt, any markets that that's more beneficial right now?\nEric Bolton: That continues to be the trend. And we saw in 2019, it was 10% and 11%, and now 14%. In the markets that we're seeing, 25% of move-ins are in Phoenix, 22% in Tampa, 20% in Nashville, 19% in Charleston. Honestly, it's just a continuation of the trends we have been seeing and we've been talking about for the last year or so.\nNick Yulico: All right. Thanks, guys.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Hi. Good morning, everyone. First, could you give the current loss to lease number? And can you talk about how much of the revenue growth you're projecting for '22 comes from realization of that loss to lease versus how much of it comes from underlying market rent growth?\nTim Argo: Yes. Brad, this is Tim. So there's a couple of ways to think about our loss to lease. But if you look at the leases we did in December, for example, the average price of -- the blended average price for December of all those leases was about 1,574. And you compare that to our December effective rent per unit, so all the leases in place in December was about 1,443. So if you do the math on that, it's roughly 9%, recognizing December's only about 5% of the leases. So it takes some time to work through that and get through a full loss to lease. Alternatively, if you base it on our new leases that we did in December, it's a little bit higher, closer to 12% or so. But in terms of what's going to flow into 2022, it's really more of a function of all the blended lease-over-lease that we saw in '21. So 10.7 was our full year blended lease-over-lease in 2021. Assuming the normal seasonality that Al talked about, we would expect half that or so to flow into 2022. So you've got, call it, 5% to 6% of sort of earned in rent price sitting here as of January 1.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then on the dispositions for this year, obviously the balance sheet is improving pretty rapidly. So I'm curious, why have dispositions at all and why not fund the capital needs with that?\nEric Bolton: Brad, this is Eric. We just think that it's really important to continue a discipline of cycling off the bottom, if you will, a little bit every year, specific properties that we think that either due to the age of the asset or submarket or neighborhood concerns that the outlook for the property is not likely to be as strong as the rest of the portfolio. And in an effort to sort of manage earnings performance and earning stability over a full cycle, one of the ways that we feel like we accomplished that is by having a discipline to cycle off a little bit every year, some of the weaker properties from an outlook perspective. So we think that -- and certainly, obviously, we're getting great pricing today. So we sold seven properties in 2021. We'll sell four is our plan at the moment in 2022. And we think that that effort is just part of our chemistry to continue to compound long-term earnings growth.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Neil Malkin from Capital One. Your line is open.\nNeil Malkin: Good morning, guys. Nice job on another stellar quarter. Can you guys please give an update on what you're sending out for renewals in February and March?\nEric Bolton: Neil, renewals are in the mid teens, ranging from sort of 15% to 17% on where they've gone out.\nNeil Malkin: Okay, great. And I know that you mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks about how potentially rising interest rates may yield some acquisition opportunities. You've been pretty outspoken about kind of focusing your capital on development, just given the historically low cap rate environment. Do you expect that in some of your markets, rising rates will eliminate some incremental marginal buyers who use a lot of leverage, floating rate to finance the property and can pay essentially uneconomic rates? Is that something that you think will actually come to fruition? Is it more of a market specific thing? Can you just kind of comment on that outlook as the year progresses and rates, at least in the short part of the curve, go higher?\nBrad Hill: Hi, Neil. This is Brad. I'll answer that. I would say, we expect as we get later in this year and as some of these interest rates do start to increase a little bit that on the margin, we could see some of the buyer interest in some of the markets that we're looking at could come down a little bit. But I'd say there's so much capital that's out there in the market right now that I think that's really on the margin. I don't see anything indicative on the horizon or from the buyers and brokers that we're talking to, to indicate that some level of interest rate rise would drive a big fall off in pricing. We're not really seeing that. We've certainly seen a run up in pricing. Here in the fourth quarter and also in the first quarter cap rates are really stable, but the underwriting is very aggressive. So we continue to see price increasing. But I think as we -- the operation start to normalize a little bit more, I do think that the run up in pricing that we've seen, the run up in rent growth that we've seen is already priced in. So I think to see another large increase in asset pricing from here on the acquisitions is not likely to come. So I think from a sellers' perspective, kind of the benefit that they're going to get is already baked in at this point. And so from the sellers and brokers we're talking to, certainly price is the most important characteristic or function right now in a transaction. I do think as we get later in the year, that starts to shift a little bit more to some level of strength that we have of execution, all cash closing, speed, those type things become a little bit more valuable as we get later in the year in our markets.\nNeil Malkin: That's super helpful. If I could, just a quick one. I've heard some rumblings about some Sunbelt apartment owners looking at potentially single family rental portfolios or assets kind of in their backyard just to sort of tap into that strength and continue to follow the renter through their lifecycle. Can you just comment on that?\nEric Bolton: Neil, this is Eric. We get asked this a lot. I think that for us at the moment, we continue to find ample opportunity we think to deploy capital and achieve some growth at very attractive yields through the physical development and pre-purchase programs that Brad has detailed. And as we sit here today, the notion of consciously going out and really deploying capital in single family rental is not something that really we're focused on doing. I just don't see frankly a real need to do that. As you mentioned, that segment of the residential market continues to attract just enormous amounts of capital. And anything in that area, much like in the apartment sector, is going to be very expensive to execute on today. And we continue to believe that the renter pool, if you will, for our product is still quite significant, growing significantly, quite deep, particularly at our affordable price point. So we think it's better for us to stick to our focus that we have on multifamily and that's certainly what our plans are at the moment.\nNeil Malkin: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.\nEric Bolton: Thanks.\nBrad Hill: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Griffin: Hi. This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. I wanted to circle back on the effective rent growth question posed initially. So I'm just curious, how do you get both to the low end and the high end of that expected guidance range?\nAl Campbell: I think it would come down to -- Mike, this is Al. And Tim can jump in here as well. It's going to come into what happens with those recent trends from here as you move into the year. What we've got dialed in is, as we talked about, two kind of normalizing factors happen in the back part of the year. We start seeing some normal seasonality to come in and we bump into those comps. And so I think the low end would be -- it would be bumped into that worse than we had projected right now, obviously, where you see, I would say, new lease pricing gets challenged earlier in the year, that is the most aggressive point of that negotiation, or the most challenging part of that negotiation. I think renewals will be stable, but  leases right now. As Tom mentioned, they're going out well. We saw that happen earlier. It would likely push toward that low end. On the other side of that, if we saw that in the environment we're seeing right now that we saw in January, we saw 16.3% blended pricing. If we saw that go for a couple of more months, a few more months, I think we would be talking about the top end of that. So that's really how we think about it. We put the forecast based on recent projection that we would see some of those factors happen. It's certainly reasonable. And so we'll monitor that as we move forward.\nTim Argo: I'll add one point, Mike. Overall, we've assumed economic backdrop of pretty good job growth and supply levels moderating a little bit. So to Al's point, if we had a shock on the job side or economic shock one way or the other, it would be something that might drive the pricing down and push us towards the lower end.\nAl Campbell: I'll add one more factor to that Tim and I've talked about it. But one thing we did forecast also, we've done this in the past, is we left ourselves room if you look at the projection for average occupancy, we left 30 basis points below the average of this year, thinking that we want to continue pushing on that price and have a little foot on the gas. So we have that as support, but that's how we think about it, Mike.\nMichael Griffin: Got you. I appreciate the color on that for sure. And then just turning to the development side, I know you anticipate 200 million to 300 million spend this year building the pipeline to 1 billion plus by the end of that year. Where do you see that sort of in the near to medium term? And how much more could you see that grow in the coming years?\nBrad Hill: Michael, this is Brad. I'll certainly talk a little bit about the near term here this year. We have pretty good visibility in terms of our starts this year. This is a focus that we've had for the last couple of years, really focusing on building out our development capability, our development platform. And we have good visibility on the six projects that we've indicated this year and expect to start those between $650 million to $750 million here by the end of this year. We've got two owned sites in Denver that we should start here in the first half of the year. We've got an owned site in Tampa that we will also start first part of this year. We have a site under contract in Raleigh that should start this year. We've got another site in Denver that we're working on. It should start late this year. And then on top of that, those are all in-house projects, so we have good visibility on those. We're also working on our JV platform. We're in predevelopment on a site right now in Salt Lake City that should start by the end of this year. And then in addition to those, we've got other JV projects that we're working on. And one of the nice things about those is the lead time. A lot of times it's less than our in-house development. So sometimes those can start within the year. So we're hopeful that we can continue to build out that even more than where we are today. But those are the starts that we have this year. Again, good visibility on that and good momentum really in building that platform and the capabilities there.\nEric Bolton: Michael, this is Eric. Just to add to what Brad is saying, I think that with 60 starts this year and the funding associated with that, I would suggest to you that that's probably -- what we're attempting to do is build a process and seek opportunities, either through pre-purchase or land sites that we can acquire that I would view that as our goal is to sort of have a steady state level of funding that approximates kind of the funding that you've seen taking place this year. It would mean depending on the pace of construction and the pace of lease up that our overall aggregate sort of pipeline, if you will, is going to be hovering around $1 billion. And we have said for some time that from an enterprise perspective, we're comfortable carrying up to about 5% of our enterprise value in a development pipeline, which at today's valuation would suggest that we're comfortable somewhere around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. So I would tell you that we would expect going forward that you're going to see the pipeline sort of stay around $1 billion and annual funding needs are going to be approximating 300 million or so.\nMichael Griffin: Great. Well, I really appreciate the color. Thanks for the time and look forward to seeing you all in Florida next month.\nEric Bolton: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to ask about your optimism on acquisitions this year and how pricing is just getting better. How dynamic are cap rates due to not only interest rate movements, but the NOI growth that's being achieved? So if NOI growth is 15% to 20%, are we going to see a similar amount of increase in cap rates this year?\nBrad Hill: Well, John, this is Brad. Based on the numbers that we're seeing, it looks to us like forward cap rates are pretty constant. They're hovering around that low 3% range right now. But what we're seeing is, as you mentioned, the rent growth and the underlying NOI growth that's being underwritten right now is in that -- it can be 15% to 20% depending on the market, which is really driving the value growth at the moment. So I think cap rates are going to be pretty steady where they are right now. I think the question is just what are folks going to underwrite on the NOI growth perspective. And that's very aggressive from where we sit today. And certainly based on the amount of liquidity that's in the market from some of the folks that we're talking to in the markets, some believe that cap rates go down from where we are today. I don't know if that's true or not, but certainly values appear to be increasing at a pretty rapid pace right now based on the underlying fundamentals.\nEric Bolton: And, John, this is Eric again. The thing I will tell you about why I think there is reason to believe that there may be better buying opportunities ahead is that when we see -- been through these cycles before and typically what happens is that as you get later into the recovery cycle, what you begin to see our sellers or developers capital is looking for a little bit more certainty for close. Particularly you see this happen towards the end of the year where contracts that have been -- our properties had been previously under contract fall out and they have year-end closing mandates, and therefore going to contract with someone like us who they know can be an all cash buyer, not subject to any kind of financing risk, and a very good track record of closing. Those attributes become more important as you get later into the cycle. I think that given what's happening within NOI growth, we don't really see the market changing from a pricing perspective so much. And for all the reasons Brad said cap rates we think are going to continue to hold very, very strong, because even with the prospect of some slight rise in interest rates, the NOI growth rate is more than compensating for that. So it's going to cause I think values to hold up quite strong. But the early indication that you see that as you get later in this cycle, the early trends that sometimes happen is certainty of close becomes a more important characteristic. And when we get to that point, that's where we think that we may have a little bit more success.\nJohn Kim: Thanks for the color. Thank you. I also wanted to follow up on your same-store revenue guidance, which was 9% at the midpoint. Tim mentioned the earnings that you're getting from rents signed last year. But the last couple of quarters, you had it at 15% and 16%. And this quarter is trending at 15% as well. So what gets you to the 9% revenue? Is there any other offsetting factors that would offset the very high rent growth that's already been achieved?\nAl Campbell: I'll start with that and then turn it to Tim. I think a couple of things. One, you're looking at revenue. So what we're talking about is effective rate growth is going to be 10%, which is a little higher and that's going to be based on largely what we talked about starting off that 16% level, which is great to see and expecting as we move late into the year to see those two normalizing factors occur a little bit, so it\u2019s normal seasonal pressure in those comps. And so that's the . Also in terms of  you've got some other areas, other income items that though they're growing, they're not going to grow at 10%. So that kind of gets you to the 9% there. And so that's how we're thinking about that factor. So I'll let Tim add more color.\nTim Argo: I think the fees and the  a little bit lower occupancy is what gets you from the effect of rent growth to the revenue growth. And then back on the pricing, it's again sort of back to Al's point about seasonality. Typically, we would see Q2 as kind of the highest price point for blended pricing, Q3 down a little bit and Q4 down from there with seasonality. And that's really what's driving it is sort of we expect that return to normal seasonality, but starting off certainly at a higher point than we would in a \u201cnormal year.\u201d\nAl Campbell: Yes. Don\u2019t forget, we also mentioned earlier, we're also giving ourselves 30 basis points, we're sort of eating 30 basis points of occupancy that's in that total revenue to give ourselves the room to continue pushing price as well. So I think all those factors impacted.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you. Looking forward to seeing you somewhere .\nEric Bolton: Yes, absolutely.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you\u2019ve said a few times the kind of main variable to guidance among the main variables is what happens with new lease growth. A rule of thumb in my mind about strength in the market in multifamily is when new lease growth exceeds renewal, and that's been happening. That's obviously likely to shift this year. Do you have an idea of how low new lease growth could go, and that is in your blended number of 10%? And the reason why I ask is, I feel like you've done 6%, 7%, almost 20% new lease growth in the fourth quarter? Could it be possible that you could get close to zero new lease growth by the end of this year, back half of this year?\nEric Bolton: No. The short answer to that, Rich, is no. We think that when you look at sort of the supply/demand dynamics and just overall strength of the market, and you're right, new lease pricing is kind of the tip of the spear, if you will. We don't see any scenario suggesting that we see that kind of 0% growth. I think that particularly in the Sunbelt markets where we continue to see demand drivers, job growth, household formation, trends population, trends migration, trends such that the demand side of the equation we think in 2022 is likely to be as strong if not stronger than what we saw in 2021. And then following on what Tim mentioned as well, supply levels and deliveries in 2022 are actually down slightly from 2021. So while clearly there was some COVID recovery kind of and unique circumstances taking place in 2021 that helped there a little bit, when you just look at the key fundamentals that drive absorption and our ability to push rents in 2022, we see no reason at the moment to believe that there's going to be any material deterioration in fundamentals. As Al mentioned, the only thing that we're really thinking about is that we know that we've got some tough prior year comps and it's hard to put a number on that. But it's there. And then we'll have to wrestle with that topic a bit later in the year. And then we do think that contrary to 2021, there probably will be some seasonality that will come back into 2022. And as you get particularly into the fourth quarter, the holiday season, leasing volumes to our traffic, it just tends to moderate a little bit. So we didn't see that in 2021. We may not see it in 2022. But we're assuming we will. And as to where that actually gets to from a new lease pricing perspective, we will see. As Al mentioned, we really budget and forecast and manage our business based on blended performance. But we certainly see new lease pricing remaining positive in 2020.\nRich Anderson: Yes, I recognize zero is an extreme ring, but nonetheless it got the answer I was looking for. So the second question, you've had a great year last year. You're looking to have another great year this year. But perhaps a mirror image of last year where it's great in the first half and slows down in the second half. Considering that cadence, we should be starting to condition people that this type of growth, double digit blender growth is not a forever circumstance. Is that the right way to think of it? I'm not looking for '23 guidance obviously. But this is setting up for CPI plus return to growth type of thing in 2023 and beyond. Would you agree with that assessment?\nEric Bolton: Rich, it's hard to say. I think if you look at '23 and beyond, probably the biggest challenge we have is we're dealing with prior year comparisons at a level that we've never dealt with before. But again, fundamentally, when you think about the drivers of demand for housing broadly, there's been all kinds of studies. I'm sure you've seen a lot of the research done suggesting that broadly in the U.S., we have undersupplied housing in the U.S. by a significant amount for the last 5 to 10 years. And so you take a region, like these Sunbelt markets where the migration trends, the population grant trends and the job growth trends are such that they're outpacing other regions of the country. The demand is strong. Single family home pricing is escalating at levels beyond anything that we've seen. Developers are having trouble, whether it be single family, multifamily, securing the materials and the labor they need to address the demand that's there. It starts to define a pretty robust environment for the foreseeable future, call it the next three or four years, and particularly, again, as it relates to these Sunbelt markets. So it's hard to say exactly what we get to in '23 and '24. But reverting back to 3.5% to 3% rent growth I don't see that for a while.\nRich Anderson: Okay, great. Well, hope to see you in Tokyo someday soon.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Good morning, everybody. So you guys talked earlier about the loss to lease being in that high single, low double digit range, and you guys are achieving well above that today on the new renewal lease rates. So is that increase, I guess, above and beyond the loss to lease just reflect kind of what you're expecting for market rent growth this year, or are you guys kind of leading the market and could end up above market by the time we get to year end?\nTim Argo: Austin, it\u2019s Tim. I think the pricing we're seeing right now is a combination, obviously, with the strength but also some of the comps going back to 12 months ago. We really saw pricing start to take off last year, around April, May and then continued to accelerate from there. And so we have this first three or four months where if you want to say there's some easier comps, those are in place, combined with the strength we saw toward the back half of last year. So I think that's kind of what's driving it now. And then, to Rich's point earlier, we'll see sort of a mirror reflection of that as we get into the back half the year and get into some of those tougher comps.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, that makes sense. So what are you projecting for market rent growth across the portfolio this year?\nAl Campbell: Well, I'll tell you what's built in our -- we talked about it earlier also. We really have blended lease pricing built in our  overall. And for the full year, the average it's going to be somewhere probably around 8% that we have built in at this point. And like we talked about, we'll look at that as we move forward. And we've talked about what it's built on this millstone  as we move to back part. Seeing some normal seasonal trends and bumping those comps Tim talked about that. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then just last one. I was curious what the rent income ratio is today. And maybe more importantly, what that figure looks like on some of the new moving leases over the last several months? \nEric Bolton: We track that on a new moving basis. And right now, it's right up -- a little under 24%, which is in line when it is in the third quarter. It's moved up slightly over the last few quarters. It's been running in the 21%, 22% before, but we're seeing frankly great revenue or great salary increases in the folks that are coming in. They're doing well. And 24% is quite comfortable compared to the 30% or 35% you hear from the economists to put stress on households. So a lot of room to run there.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Great. Good morning down there and certainly you guys are popular. A lot of people want to take you to different places. So a few questions here. One, first a clarification. On the year-over-year comps, is there any free rent that you're comping over? So like the 16% number that you cited, is that enhanced in any way by burn off of free rent a year ago, or this is absolute rent growth?\nTim Argo: It's absolute effective rent growth. Concessions were a little bit higher this time last year, but we're talking 10 to 20 basis points of difference. So it's really no impact at all.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And then Eric, as far as the seasonality, your markets never really had the shutdown that the Post had. So it's not like there's a big reopening. That said, several articles have highlighted the job recovery back to near pre-pandemic levels. So what do you think is causing the aberration in terms of basically seasonality no longer being the case last year and potentially this year? Is it -- because again, it's not like all these markets suddenly reopened and people are surging back? So what do you think is really driving this?\nEric Bolton: Alex, I think that -- the fact that we did not have a seasonal slowdown in 2021 I think I would just attribute to just a continued very strong demand drivers for housing across the Sunbelt, whether it's job growth, it\u2019s migration trends, as people looking to come to a more affordable region of the country, whatever the motivations and drivers are, I think that those trends were there in 2021 and more than offset whatever slowdown typically occurs when people get to the holiday timeframe, and are just less reluctant to think about moving. I think that we just had such strong pull to these markets for all the reasons I mentioned that in '21, we overcame that normal seasonal mindset. In 2022, I think -- we don't know. We think that it's prudent to think about some kind of a normal seasonal slowdown. Certainly when you look at how we stagger our lease expirations from a portfolio management perspective, we tend to stagger more of our lease expirations in the summer and spring and we intentionally stagger fewer expirations in the winter months, believing that the traffic levels will be a little moderate -- moderate down from what you see in the spring and the summer. So that's the way we've sort of set up the forecast and the way we manage our lease expirations from a portfolio perspective. We may be surprised again in 2022. And with all the factors that are at play today, it may continue to hold up or will hold up to some degree I'm sure. I think that we may be surprised to the upside again in 2022. But right now, we just believe that a normal seasonal slowdown in the holiday fourth quarter of next year is a prudent thing to count on.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And then just finally, a quick question on development yields. Obviously, there's this cost pressure, there's timing delays, but you have really strong rent growth. So in your model -- and I realize that every pro forma always pencils, but in your model, do you anticipate rent growth outpacing the timing delays in materials and labor, or do you think that the costs will outrun or that they're even, in which case yields are unchanged?\nBrad Hill: Yes, Alex, this is Brad. We are underwriting a little bit of downward pressure on our development yields. The developments that we have in our pipeline right now that we've started, those are kind of locked in, call it a 5.9 yield, with frankly upward movement in that yield when we update with current rents that we're seeing that are outpacing what our original expectations are. So the things that are on the book will certainly outperform what we expect. We do expect those yields to come down maybe to 5.25, 5.5. But I'll remind you that the way we underwrite our developments, we're very conservative. We're underwriting at today's rents with very little trending. So if we have a development that we're working on today that starts in 2023, we do not trend those rents for this year. And depending on what third party provider you're looking at, we're expecting rent growth this year of 10% to 15%. So if we were to underwrite our developments with those trending, I think we'll be fine and match the yields that we're seeing today. But we're not banking on that when we go into a development. We're underwriting with rents today and are just conservative in our underwriting and our expectations.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChandni Luthra: Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Thank you for taking my question. So you guys talked about supply levels and deliveries in 2022 were actually down slightly from 2021. So looking out to 2023 and kind of thinking about sort of this fall or rather delay from 2022 plus all this surge capital that we have been seeing into your markets, what gives you comfort that there isn't an oversupply situation developing in your backyard, as we look out beyond this year? And as a follow up of that, how do you think about your offering being competitive in such an event?\nEric Bolton: Well, we don't believe that there is an oversupply risk building at the moment. We think that as you do start to look at 2023, and particularly in 2024, based on permitting data and new start data that we see, it suggests to us that supply levels may pick up or will pick up in late '23 into 2024 from what's currently happening. But that's a pickup in supply. What really matters is how does that supply level compare to the demand that is there in resulting absorption that you get. And with the strong demand trends that we expect to continue across these Sunbelt markets, I would characterize what we anticipate happening as a consequence of supply is perhaps the potential for some moderation in rent growth to begin to show up in late '23 into 2024 as a consequence of supply levels. But the extent of that moderation, if at all, is really going to come down to what's happening on the demand side of the equation. And what we see happening in Sunbelt markets is continued very strong demand. Coupled with that is what's happening on the single family side, both single family rental and for sale, where the demand there continues to -- and the supply there continues to be limited. And so broadly speaking, we just think that it sets up for a very strong demand outlook for apartment housing for the next two or three years. And even with some supply levels picking up a little bit in late '23 or '24, I think it suggests to us that at worst we're looking at a slight moderation, if you will, from today's performance trends on rent growth. But we don't at this point see any reason to underwrite any kind of long-term expectation for even reverting back to long-term historical trends. We think we'll be above that for some time. \nBrad Hill: And this is Brad. I'll add another point to that. On the construction side, we're seeing schedule certainly elongated. We're seeing labor struggles in the market. So getting projects finished is taking longer. So the overall system is pretty much at capacity. So it's really hard to see a major uptick in the supply side as we go forward.\nOperator: All right. And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Your line is open.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. A quick question on same-store numbers. You guys are forecasting 8% to 10% same-store revenue growth. What is the band by market? Is that like 5% at the low end and 15% at the high end? Where's that band and what markets are you seeing its top and which markets are you expecting to be at the bottom of that among your major ones?\nOperator: And I do apologize. Speakers, can you hear us? If you can hear us, we are unable to hear you. And I do apologize, participants, for the technical difficulties. We will try and get the speakers reconnected. Just one moment. And I do apologize, everyone. It looks like the speakers lost power. They are reconnecting just momentarily. All right, everyone. We got the speakers reconnected. They're going to let us know what happened. Go ahead.\nEric Bolton: Sorry. This is Eric Bolton here. We're actually having an ice and snowstorm here in Memphis, believe it or not. And one of the -- the building lost power. And so the generator kicked back on, but the line got disconnected. So all is well, but we did lose power. I'm going to suggest that we just go ahead and wrap up the earnings call at this point.  I think there were three more questions out there.

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2021 with strong momentum in rent growth, driving fourth quarter results that were ahead of expectations. The demand for apartment housing across our markets continues to grow. Comparing the pricing achieved on all the leases that went into effect during the fourth quarter on a lease-over-lease basis, rents jumped 16% as compared to the rents on expiring leases. This is 100 basis points ahead of the performance in the preceding third quarter. We are clearly carrying good momentum for continued strong rent growth in the coming year.  As outlined in our earnings guidance for 2022, we plan to take further advantage of the strong leasing environment and drive additional rent growth through unit interior upgrades and more extensive full repositioning projects at several communities. Additionally, we continue a steady rollout of a number of new technology initiatives aimed at further expanding our operating margins. We are just beginning to harvest some of the benefits of our new tech initiatives with 30 leasing positions eliminated through attrition in 2021, and another 50 leasing positions targeted to be eliminated by the end of this year.  Our new development and lease-up portfolios continue to make solid progress with leasing velocity and rents running ahead of our pro forma expectations. As Brad will outline in his comments, we have several additional new projects that we are expected to start in 2022.  The balance sheet remains a very strong position. And during the fourth quarter, Standard & Poor's moved their credit rating outlook on MAA to a positive status. Given the strong earnings performance and robust pricing being captured on property dispositions, we expect to see the balance sheet metrics improve further in 2022.  Our initial earnings guidance for 2022 outlines in more detail our expectations for continued strong performance from our existing portfolio, the expansion of our new development pipeline and our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet.  Following a 9% growth in core FFO per share in calendar year 2021, we're forecasting a 13% growth in core FFO in 2022 at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our team of MAA associates had a terrific year performance in 2021, and I very much appreciate their service to our residents and support to each other.  And that's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom to update on property operations. Tom? That continues to be the trend. And we saw in 2019, it was 10% and 11%, and now 14%. In the markets that we're seeing, 25% of move-ins are in Phoenix, 22% in Tampa, 20% in Nashville, 19% in Charleston. Honestly, it's just a continuation of the trends we have been seeing and we've been talking about for the last year or so. Thanks, Nick. Brad, this is Eric. We just think that it's really important to continue a discipline of cycling off the bottom, if you will, a little bit every year, specific properties that we think that either due to the age of the asset or submarket or neighborhood concerns that the outlook for the property is not likely to be as strong as the rest of the portfolio. And in an effort to sort of manage earnings performance and earning stability over a full cycle, one of the ways that we feel like we accomplished that is by having a discipline to cycle off a little bit every year, some of the weaker properties from an outlook perspective. So we think that -- and certainly, obviously, we're getting great pricing today. So we sold seven properties in 2021. We'll sell four is our plan at the moment in 2022. And we think that that effort is just part of our chemistry to continue to compound long-term earnings growth. Neil, renewals are in the mid teens, ranging from sort of 15% to 17% on where they've gone out. Neil, this is Eric. We get asked this a lot. I think that for us at the moment, we continue to find ample opportunity we think to deploy capital and achieve some growth at very attractive yields through the physical development and pre-purchase programs that Brad has detailed. And as we sit here today, the notion of consciously going out and really deploying capital in single family rental is not something that really we're focused on doing. I just don't see frankly a real need to do that. As you mentioned, that segment of the residential market continues to attract just enormous amounts of capital. And anything in that area, much like in the apartment sector, is going to be very expensive to execute on today. And we continue to believe that the renter pool, if you will, for our product is still quite significant, growing significantly, quite deep, particularly at our affordable price point. So we think it's better for us to stick to our focus that we have on multifamily and that's certainly what our plans are at the moment. Thanks. Michael, this is Eric. Just to add to what Brad is saying, I think that with 60 starts this year and the funding associated with that, I would suggest to you that that's probably -- what we're attempting to do is build a process and seek opportunities, either through pre-purchase or land sites that we can acquire that I would view that as our goal is to sort of have a steady state level of funding that approximates kind of the funding that you've seen taking place this year. It would mean depending on the pace of construction and the pace of lease up that our overall aggregate sort of pipeline, if you will, is going to be hovering around $1 billion. And we have said for some time that from an enterprise perspective, we're comfortable carrying up to about 5% of our enterprise value in a development pipeline, which at today's valuation would suggest that we're comfortable somewhere around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. So I would tell you that we would expect going forward that you're going to see the pipeline sort of stay around $1 billion and annual funding needs are going to be approximating 300 million or so. Thank you. And, John, this is Eric again. The thing I will tell you about why I think there is reason to believe that there may be better buying opportunities ahead is that when we see -- been through these cycles before and typically what happens is that as you get later into the recovery cycle, what you begin to see our sellers or developers capital is looking for a little bit more certainty for close. Particularly you see this happen towards the end of the year where contracts that have been -- our properties had been previously under contract fall out and they have year-end closing mandates, and therefore going to contract with someone like us who they know can be an all cash buyer, not subject to any kind of financing risk, and a very good track record of closing. Those attributes become more important as you get later into the cycle. I think that given what's happening within NOI growth, we don't really see the market changing from a pricing perspective so much. And for all the reasons Brad said cap rates we think are going to continue to hold very, very strong, because even with the prospect of some slight rise in interest rates, the NOI growth rate is more than compensating for that. So it's going to cause I think values to hold up quite strong. But the early indication that you see that as you get later in this cycle, the early trends that sometimes happen is certainty of close becomes a more important characteristic. And when we get to that point, that's where we think that we may have a little bit more success. Yes, absolutely. No. The short answer to that, Rich, is no. We think that when you look at sort of the supply/demand dynamics and just overall strength of the market, and you're right, new lease pricing is kind of the tip of the spear, if you will. We don't see any scenario suggesting that we see that kind of 0% growth. I think that particularly in the Sunbelt markets where we continue to see demand drivers, job growth, household formation, trends population, trends migration, trends such that the demand side of the equation we think in 2022 is likely to be as strong if not stronger than what we saw in 2021. And then following on what Tim mentioned as well, supply levels and deliveries in 2022 are actually down slightly from 2021. So while clearly there was some COVID recovery kind of and unique circumstances taking place in 2021 that helped there a little bit, when you just look at the key fundamentals that drive absorption and our ability to push rents in 2022, we see no reason at the moment to believe that there's going to be any material deterioration in fundamentals. As Al mentioned, the only thing that we're really thinking about is that we know that we've got some tough prior year comps and it's hard to put a number on that. But it's there. And then we'll have to wrestle with that topic a bit later in the year. And then we do think that contrary to 2021, there probably will be some seasonality that will come back into 2022. And as you get particularly into the fourth quarter, the holiday season, leasing volumes to our traffic, it just tends to moderate a little bit. So we didn't see that in 2021. We may not see it in 2022. But we're assuming we will. And as to where that actually gets to from a new lease pricing perspective, we will see. As Al mentioned, we really budget and forecast and manage our business based on blended performance. But we certainly see new lease pricing remaining positive in 2020. Rich, it's hard to say. I think if you look at '23 and beyond, probably the biggest challenge we have is we're dealing with prior year comparisons at a level that we've never dealt with before. But again, fundamentally, when you think about the drivers of demand for housing broadly, there's been all kinds of studies. I'm sure you've seen a lot of the research done suggesting that broadly in the U.S., we have undersupplied housing in the U.S. by a significant amount for the last 5 to 10 years. And so you take a region, like these Sunbelt markets where the migration trends, the population grant trends and the job growth trends are such that they're outpacing other regions of the country. The demand is strong. Single family home pricing is escalating at levels beyond anything that we've seen. Developers are having trouble, whether it be single family, multifamily, securing the materials and the labor they need to address the demand that's there. It starts to define a pretty robust environment for the foreseeable future, call it the next three or four years, and particularly, again, as it relates to these Sunbelt markets. So it's hard to say exactly what we get to in '23 and '24. But reverting back to 3.5% to 3% rent growth I don't see that for a while. Thanks, Rich. We track that on a new moving basis. And right now, it's right up -- a little under 24%, which is in line when it is in the third quarter. It's moved up slightly over the last few quarters. It's been running in the 21%, 22% before, but we're seeing frankly great revenue or great salary increases in the folks that are coming in. They're doing well. And 24% is quite comfortable compared to the 30% or 35% you hear from the economists to put stress on households. So a lot of room to run there. Alex, I think that -- the fact that we did not have a seasonal slowdown in 2021 I think I would just attribute to just a continued very strong demand drivers for housing across the Sunbelt, whether it's job growth, it's migration trends, as people looking to come to a more affordable region of the country, whatever the motivations and drivers are, I think that those trends were there in 2021 and more than offset whatever slowdown typically occurs when people get to the holiday timeframe, and are just less reluctant to think about moving. I think that we just had such strong pull to these markets for all the reasons I mentioned that in '21, we overcame that normal seasonal mindset. In 2022, I think -- we don't know. We think that it's prudent to think about some kind of a normal seasonal slowdown. Certainly when you look at how we stagger our lease expirations from a portfolio management perspective, we tend to stagger more of our lease expirations in the summer and spring and we intentionally stagger fewer expirations in the winter months, believing that the traffic levels will be a little moderate -- moderate down from what you see in the spring and the summer. So that's the way we've sort of set up the forecast and the way we manage our lease expirations from a portfolio perspective. We may be surprised again in 2022. And with all the factors that are at play today, it may continue to hold up or will hold up to some degree I'm sure. I think that we may be surprised to the upside again in 2022. But right now, we just believe that a normal seasonal slowdown in the holiday fourth quarter of next year is a prudent thing to count on. Thanks, Alex. Well, we don't believe that there is an oversupply risk building at the moment. We think that as you do start to look at 2023, and particularly in 2024, based on permitting data and new start data that we see, it suggests to us that supply levels may pick up or will pick up in late '23 into 2024 from what's currently happening. But that's a pickup in supply. What really matters is how does that supply level compare to the demand that is there in resulting absorption that you get. And with the strong demand trends that we expect to continue across these Sunbelt markets, I would characterize what we anticipate happening as a consequence of supply is perhaps the potential for some moderation in rent growth to begin to show up in late '23 into 2024 as a consequence of supply levels. But the extent of that moderation, if at all, is really going to come down to what's happening on the demand side of the equation. And what we see happening in Sunbelt markets is continued very strong demand. Coupled with that is what's happening on the single family side, both single family rental and for sale, where the demand there continues to -- and the supply there continues to be limited. And so broadly speaking, we just think that it sets up for a very strong demand outlook for apartment housing for the next two or three years. And even with some supply levels picking up a little bit in late '23 or '24, I think it suggests to us that at worst we're looking at a slight moderation, if you will, from today's performance trends on rent growth. But we don't at this point see any reason to underwrite any kind of long-term expectation for even reverting back to long-term historical trends. We think we'll be above that for some time. Sorry. This is Eric Bolton here. We're actually having an ice and snowstorm here in Memphis, believe it or not. And one of the -- the building lost power. And so the generator kicked back on, but the line got disconnected. So all is well, but we did lose power. I'm going to suggest that we just go ahead and wrap up the earnings call at this point.  I think there were three more questions out there. And I would just ask that the two guys reach out to us directly. Feel free to call either myself or Al or Andrew and we'll be happy to answer your questions. But we appreciate everyone joining us this morning and sorry for the lost power here. But all is good on our side. So thank you very much."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record year for multifamily transactions and the fourth quarter was no exception. We continue to see very strong asset pricing trends across our footprint with an acceleration in pricing in the fourth quarter.  Operational performance across our markets is strong, driving continued high investor demand. Bid sheets are deep, with winners surviving multiple best and final rounds and offering aggressive all around deal terms.  To date, we've seen no negative impact on asset values from expected rising interest rates and we believe the tremendous amount of liquidity coupled with continued strong rent growth expectations will drive values higher. We remain active in the transaction market and are constantly evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, particularly in a rising rate environment, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties could materialize. New development continues to provide a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital as compared to acquisitions. So we will continue to focus on growing our development pipeline.  Our pipeline ended 2021 at $460 million under construction and $242 million in lease up. As we've indicated in the past, the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions. But we remain focused on expanding our opportunity.  Later in 2022, the growth in our pipeline will be more evident as we expect to end the year with $900 million to $1 billion under construction and $300 million in lease up. Therefore, we expect our total under construction and in lease up to grow from approximately $700 million at the end of 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by the end of 2022.  This ramp up will include in-house developments at two owned sites in Denver, one of which is a three-phase site, an owned site in Tampa, and two controlled sites in Denver and Raleigh. On the pre-purchase side of our development operation, we are in predevelopment on the Salt Lake City site that we hope to start in late 2022.  Performance at communities and their initial lease up is going well. Absorption is stronger than we expected and rents on average are 5% to 13% above performance. Reflective of the strong absorption, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Novel Midtown community to first quarter '22.  All of our under construction projects remain at or below our budgeted construction costs, but we continue to see increased and broad-based material shortages and delivery delays. In addition, we've begun to see some level of labor shortages in the market.  Our construction team has done a great job navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact of schedules and the economics of our projects. But this is an area we'll need to actively monitor throughout the year.  We expect these challenges to add 60 days or so to any new starts this year, and we expect a 30-day delay at our Val Vista and Westglenn projects. We've adjusted our construction schedules as noted in the supplemental to reflect the delay at these two properties.  We had tremendous execution on our property dispositions in 2021, selling seven assets and achieving pricing well ahead of our expectations. Our fourth quarter dispositions were sold above our guidance range, generating a leveraged investment IRR of 26% for these 29-year-old assets. In 2022, we will continue our discipline pruning of the portfolio and expect to sell another four properties over the coming year.  That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al. Hi, Neil. This is Brad. I'll answer that. I would say, we expect as we get later in this year and as some of these interest rates do start to increase a little bit that on the margin, we could see some of the buyer interest in some of the markets that we're looking at could come down a little bit. But I'd say there's so much capital that's out there in the market right now that I think that's really on the margin. I don't see anything indicative on the horizon or from the buyers and brokers that we're talking to, to indicate that some level of interest rate rise would drive a big fall off in pricing. We're not really seeing that. We've certainly seen a run up in pricing. Here in the fourth quarter and also in the first quarter cap rates are really stable, but the underwriting is very aggressive. So we continue to see price increasing. But I think as we -- the operation start to normalize a little bit more, I do think that the run up in pricing that we've seen, the run up in rent growth that we've seen is already priced in. So I think to see another large increase in asset pricing from here on the acquisitions is not likely to come. So I think from a sellers' perspective, kind of the benefit that they're going to get is already baked in at this point. And so from the sellers and brokers we're talking to, certainly price is the most important characteristic or function right now in a transaction. I do think as we get later in the year, that starts to shift a little bit more to some level of strength that we have of execution, all cash closing, speed, those type things become a little bit more valuable as we get later in the year in our markets. Thanks, Neil. Michael, this is Brad. I'll certainly talk a little bit about the near term here this year. We have pretty good visibility in terms of our starts this year. This is a focus that we've had for the last couple of years, really focusing on building out our development capability, our development platform. And we have good visibility on the six projects that we've indicated this year and expect to start those between $650 million to $750 million here by the end of this year. We've got two owned sites in Denver that we should start here in the first half of the year. We've got an owned site in Tampa that we will also start first part of this year. We have a site under contract in Raleigh that should start this year. We've got another site in Denver that we're working on. It should start late this year. And then on top of that, those are all in-house projects, so we have good visibility on those. We're also working on our JV platform. We're in predevelopment on a site right now in Salt Lake City that should start by the end of this year. And then in addition to those, we've got other JV projects that we're working on. And one of the nice things about those is the lead time. A lot of times it's less than our in-house development. So sometimes those can start within the year. So we're hopeful that we can continue to build out that even more than where we are today. But those are the starts that we have this year. Again, good visibility on that and good momentum really in building that platform and the capabilities there. Well, John, this is Brad. Based on the numbers that we're seeing, it looks to us like forward cap rates are pretty constant. They're hovering around that low 3% range right now. But what we're seeing is, as you mentioned, the rent growth and the underlying NOI growth that's being underwritten right now is in that -- it can be 15% to 20% depending on the market, which is really driving the value growth at the moment. So I think cap rates are going to be pretty steady where they are right now. I think the question is just what are folks going to underwrite on the NOI growth perspective. And that's very aggressive from where we sit today. And certainly based on the amount of liquidity that's in the market from some of the folks that we're talking to in the markets, some believe that cap rates go down from where we are today. I don't know if that's true or not, but certainly values appear to be increasing at a pretty rapid pace right now based on the underlying fundamentals. Yes, Alex, this is Brad. We are underwriting a little bit of downward pressure on our development yields. The developments that we have in our pipeline right now that we've started, those are kind of locked in, call it a 5.9 yield, with frankly upward movement in that yield when we update with current rents that we're seeing that are outpacing what our original expectations are. So the things that are on the book will certainly outperform what we expect. We do expect those yields to come down maybe to 5.25, 5.5. But I'll remind you that the way we underwrite our developments, we're very conservative. We're underwriting at today's rents with very little trending. So if we have a development that we're working on today that starts in 2023, we do not trend those rents for this year. And depending on what third party provider you're looking at, we're expecting rent growth this year of 10% to 15%. So if we were to underwrite our developments with those trending, I think we'll be fine and match the yields that we're seeing today. But we're not banking on that when we go into a development. We're underwriting with rents today and are just conservative in our underwriting and our expectations. And this is Brad. I'll add another point to that. On the construction side, we're seeing schedule certainly elongated. We're seeing labor struggles in the market. So getting projects finished is taking longer. So the overall system is pretty much at capacity. So it's really hard to see a major uptick in the supply side as we go forward."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Al Campbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Core FFO performance of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter was $0.07 per share, above the midpoint of our guidance. Producing core FFO was $7.01 per share for the full year, which, as Eric mentioned, is 9% above the prior year. That performance for the quarter is virtually all from revenue growth.  As Tom outlined, strong pricing trends continued through the fourth quarter. So no seasonal slowdown, which not only benefited the fourth quarter, but provide additional strength for 2022 expectations, which I'll talk about more in just a moment.  In total, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were essential in line with our expectations as some inflationary pressures impacted repair and maintenance costs. Real estate taxes were lower than expected due to favorable appeals and rate rollbacks finalized during the quarter.  We expect some continued inflationary pressures in our operating expenses during 2022, but we expect the impact to be more than absorbed through the continued strong revenue growth for the year. We did provide initial earnings guidance for 2022 with the release, which is detailed in a supplemental package with the release.  Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $7.92 per share at the midpoint of the range, which represents a 13% growth over the prior year. The overall backdrop for our projected 2022 performance is continued strong occupancy levels, remaining between 95.6% and 96% for the full year, providing a foundation support of continued strong growth in effective rent per unit as the strong blended lease-over-lease rent rates continue to work through our portfolio.  Effective rent growth is projected to be 10% for the year at the midpoint, which is nearly twice the total of effective rent growth posted for 2021. This result is based on continued strong blended lease rate growth through the first few quarters with some normal seasonal trends and challenging comparisons beginning to be felt late in the year, particularly during the fourth quarter. This produces projected total same-store revenue growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. As mentioned, we expect to see some inflationary pressures impacting our same-store operating expenses for the year. The personnel costs, repair maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance costs, all trending above long-term growth rates producing 5% to 6% growth overall for 2022. However, this pressure is expected to be more than offset by the strong revenue trends producing an NOI growth expectation of 10% to 12% for the year. Our forecast also assumes an active transaction year with projected development funding of 200 million to 300 million for the year and acquisitions of 75 million to 125 million. We expect a majority of this to be funded on disposition proceeds of between 300 million and 350 million. Our forecast anticipates us starting six new development projects during the year, a combination of in-house, pre-purchase deals, as outlined by Brad, which will increase our total pipeline and funding commitment as we enter 2023.  We currently have no plans to raise additional equity during the year as our forecast projects our leverage to end the year slightly below the current level with debt to EBITDA ranging 4x to 4.5x. Also virtually all of our debt is currently fixed with maturities well laddered, over 8.7 years on average, providing some protection against rising interest rates.  So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Chris, we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions. Yes. This is Al. I could give you some color on that. And as we talked for a little bit in the comments, it's really -- it's based on a strong projection of revenue for sure. But carrying the significant strength of what you're seeing in the fourth quarter end of the year and having pricing of beginning year, as we talked about, move to the back half of the year being impacted by a couple of things, really just some normal seasonality. As we entered the back part of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we thought we'd see some seasonality really power through that. It just continued to accelerate in rent pricing. So our forecast is built on continued strong pricing, particularly in the first half of the year, beginning in the back half to feel a little bit of normal seasonality and then hitting those tough comps that we saw from the fourth quarter. So I wouldn't say that we project a weakness at all, we're just projecting a couple of things that come back to sort of normality in the back part of the year. I think that's -- we felt like that was a prudent forecast for the year. I'll give you overall, and if some of these other guys want to jump in here. But what I'm saying is first to forecast, we build our forecast often blended, first and foremost, because that's really -- that drives obviously the economic portion of the forecast. And so how it falls out from renewals to new leases where we don't focus specifically on the forecast other than I would say the underlying belief expectation is that you'll see renewals be pretty steady through the year. That's where you'll see the strength continue to market that we're seeing right now continue. If we see the seasonality that we're talking about in new comps, you'll feel that more in new lease pricing. So I hesitate to give too much details there, because we're focused on blended. I think that's the most important number. But that's how we think about it. And we've laid it out in our forecast as you'll see that, those two normalizing factors hit the new pricing on the year. I think it would come down to -- Mike, this is Al. And Tim can jump in here as well. It's going to come into what happens with those recent trends from here as you move into the year. What we've got dialed in is, as we talked about, two kind of normalizing factors happen in the back part of the year. We start seeing some normal seasonality to come in and we bump into those comps. And so I think the low end would be -- it would be bumped into that worse than we had projected right now, obviously, where you see, I would say, new lease pricing gets challenged earlier in the year, that is the most aggressive point of that negotiation, or the most challenging part of that negotiation. I think renewals will be stable, but  leases right now. As Tom mentioned, they're going out well. We saw that happen earlier. It would likely push toward that low end. On the other side of that, if we saw that in the environment we're seeing right now that we saw in January, we saw 16.3% blended pricing. If we saw that go for a couple of more months, a few more months, I think we would be talking about the top end of that. So that's really how we think about it. We put the forecast based on recent projection that we would see some of those factors happen. It's certainly reasonable. And so we'll monitor that as we move forward. I'll add one more factor to that Tim and I've talked about it. But one thing we did forecast also, we've done this in the past, is we left ourselves room if you look at the projection for average occupancy, we left 30 basis points below the average of this year, thinking that we want to continue pushing on that price and have a little foot on the gas. So we have that as support, but that's how we think about it, Mike. I'll start with that and then turn it to Tim. I think a couple of things. One, you're looking at revenue. So what we're talking about is effective rate growth is going to be 10%, which is a little higher and that's going to be based on largely what we talked about starting off that 16% level, which is great to see and expecting as we move late into the year to see those two normalizing factors occur a little bit, so it's normal seasonal pressure in those comps. And so that's the . Also in terms of  you've got some other areas, other income items that though they're growing, they're not going to grow at 10%. So that kind of gets you to the 9% there. And so that's how we're thinking about that factor. So I'll let Tim add more color. Yes. Don't forget, we also mentioned earlier, we're also giving ourselves 30 basis points, we're sort of eating 30 basis points of occupancy that's in that total revenue to give ourselves the room to continue pushing price as well. So I think all those factors impacted. Well, I'll tell you what's built in our -- we talked about it earlier also. We really have blended lease pricing built in our  overall. And for the full year, the average it's going to be somewhere probably around 8% that we have built in at this point. And like we talked about, we'll look at that as we move forward. And we've talked about what it's built on this millstone  as we move to back part. Seeing some normal seasonal trends and bumping those comps Tim talked about that."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust and those trends carried into 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the fourth quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 10.1% on a year-over-year basis.  Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver, and with current blended pricing momentum we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96%.  As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we completed 6,360 interior unit upgrades and installed 23,579 Smart Home packages. This brings the total number of Smart units to 48,000. In 2022, we plan to complete a similar level of interior unit upgrades and Smart Home packages. For our repositioning programs, we're in the final stages of completing work on our first eight properties in the program and have another eight that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continued into 2022. Lease-over-lease pricing on new move-in leases for January was 15.4%, ahead of the rent on the prior lease.  Renewal lease pricing for January was running 17.1% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio was up approximately 16.3% in January. Average daily occupancy for the month of January is currently 95.9% which is 50 basis points better than January of last year.  Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. This is 60 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We're well positioned as we move into 2022. I'm grateful for our team's continued resilience and strong performance. I'm excited to see what they accomplish in 2022.  I'll now turn the call over to Brad."

            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Yes. Brad, this is Tim. So there's a couple of ways to think about our loss to lease. But if you look at the leases we did in December, for example, the average price of -- the blended average price for December of all those leases was about 1,574. And you compare that to our December effective rent per unit, so all the leases in place in December was about 1,443. So if you do the math on that, it's roughly 9%, recognizing December's only about 5% of the leases. So it takes some time to work through that and get through a full loss to lease. Alternatively, if you base it on our new leases that we did in December, it's a little bit higher, closer to 12% or so. But in terms of what's going to flow into 2022, it's really more of a function of all the blended lease-over-lease that we saw in '21. So 10.7 was our full year blended lease-over-lease in 2021. Assuming the normal seasonality that Al talked about, we would expect half that or so to flow into 2022. So you've got, call it, 5% to 6% of sort of earned in rent price sitting here as of January 1. I'll add one point, Mike. Overall, we've assumed economic backdrop of pretty good job growth and supply levels moderating a little bit. So to Al's point, if we had a shock on the job side or economic shock one way or the other, it would be something that might drive the pricing down and push us towards the lower end. I think the fees and the  a little bit lower occupancy is what gets you from the effect of rent growth to the revenue growth. And then back on the pricing, it's again sort of back to Al's point about seasonality. Typically, we would see Q2 as kind of the highest price point for blended pricing, Q3 down a little bit and Q4 down from there with seasonality. And that's really what's driving it is sort of we expect that return to normal seasonality, but starting off certainly at a higher point than we would in a \u201cnormal year.\u201d Austin, it's Tim. I think the pricing we're seeing right now is a combination, obviously, with the strength but also some of the comps going back to 12 months ago. We really saw pricing start to take off last year, around April, May and then continued to accelerate from there. And so we have this first three or four months where if you want to say there's some easier comps, those are in place, combined with the strength we saw toward the back half of last year. So I think that's kind of what's driving it now. And then, to Rich's point earlier, we'll see sort of a mirror reflection of that as we get into the back half the year and get into some of those tougher comps. It's absolute effective rent growth. Concessions were a little bit higher this time last year, but we're talking 10 to 20 basis points of difference. So it's really no impact at all."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the Company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance of MAA for opening comments.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Mallory, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Robert DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Our third quarter results were well ahead of expectations. Growing demand across our Sunbelt markets continues to drive strong rent growth and high occupancy, steady job growth, favorable migration trends, wage growth and escalating pricing of single-family housing are all driving strong performance for apartment rents across our portfolio. We're carrying significant pricing momentum into calendar year '22. Resident turnover remains low. Collections remain strong, occupancy is high and rent-to-income ratios remain very affordable. This all suggests to us that we have good capacity in the market for the pricing trends that we are currently capturing. As we think about next year, we believe leasing conditions across our markets will remain favorable. Our Sunbelt markets continue to capture good job growth, driving positive migration trends. New move-ins year-to-date from households relocating to our Sunbelt markets constitute 14% of our new leases as compared to just over 10% in the same time frame of 2020. High pricing trends associated with single-family housing are further supporting strong demand for apartment housing. In the third quarter, move-outs among our resident base to buy a home were down 12% as compared to prior year, and move-outs to rent a home were down 38%. We continue to keep an eye on pressure surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. Year-to-date, our biggest pressure on operating expenses is building repairs and maintenance costs, which are up just over 6%. Pressure is associated with both materials and labor. We expect year-over-year increases in repair and maintenance expenses will likely hold in the 6% range through the end of the year. Our current development pipeline remains on budget for both development costs and timing for unit deliveries. We're working into our planning and pro formas more cost and unit delivery contingencies as we expect the supply chain challenges to be with us through next year. But again, at this point, our current predevelopment pipeline remains fully on track and we expect to start several additional new projects in 2022. In summary, our markets continue to capture strong demand driving robust rent growth that will carry into 2022. And MAA's uniquely diversified approach across the Sunbelt region, supported by a very strong balance sheet, has the Company well positioned to take advantage of the outlook for continued strong leasing fundamentals in our markets. We continue to build strength in our technology platform and their operating capabilities. Our redevelopment program and several repositioning projects will drive higher earnings opportunity from our existing portfolio. We expect to capture meaningful expansion in our operating margins over the next couple of years. In addition, our external growth pipeline continues to expand and will deliver meaningful value accretion over the coming years. MAA is well positioned heading into 2022 and we're excited about the prospects for continued outperformance in the coming year. I'd like to thank the MAA team for the tremendous progress this year and the very positive results. I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the third quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 15%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis grew 6.3%. This is nearly 5x the 1.3% growth of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96.4%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages. This will bring our total number of smart units up to 47,000 units. We're in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first eight full repositioned properties and have another eight that are underway this year. Leasing activity for October has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for October is running close to 20% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in October is running 13% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16% so far for October. Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 95.9% which is 30 basis points better than October of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 6.8%. This is 10 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We are well positioned as we move into the fourth quarter and '22. I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well, have shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their progress in 2021. Brad?\nBrad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The already robust investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint has strengthened. Transaction volume is at a record high as investors are looking to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets. Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand continues to push pricing growth. putting further downward pressure on cap rates. While the main focus of our capital deployment effort is currently on development through our in-house development and our repurchase program with third-party developers, we remain active in the transaction market and are actively evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities. For the moment, new development provides a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital. We believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, we will likely find more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties. Our pre-purchase and development pipeline that includes both under construction and in lease-up projects stands at 2,999 units with a total cost of $710 million. While the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions, we continue to make good progress towards growing the pipeline. Our in-house development team has multiple sites either owned or under contract that we expect to start construction on in 2022. We have three sites in Denver, one of which is a three-phase site, a two-phase site in Raleigh and a site in Tampa. Additionally, we are negotiating on pre-purchase projects in Charlotte and Salt Lake City that we hope to start next year as well. Despite inflationary pressures on materials and labor, we expect stabilized NOI yields on our new projects to remain in the 5.5 to 5.75 range. The strong leasing demand we're seeing across our portfolio is also evident in our lease-up properties, where we're seeing rents and velocity well above our pro forma. Because of this strong demand, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Sand Lake property in Orlando by two quarters with an expected stabilization date of third quarter '22. All of our under-construction projects remain on budget and on schedule with yield expectations at or above our original projections. These projects have fixed cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing increased material shortages due to strong demand and shipping delays. Our construction management team has done a great job in navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact to our schedules. However, we expect these supply chain disruptions could add 60 days or so to any new starts next year. We've made great progress on our remaining dispositions for the year, which includes two properties in Savannah and one in Charlotte. The buyers are through their due diligence processes with hard earnest money deposits so the closing should wrap up fairly soon. Pricing on these 31-year-old assets is very strong, generating a levered investment IRR of 30%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al.\nAl Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad. The continued very strong pricing trends and high occupancy through the third quarter produced revenue performance well above our prior expectations. Core FFO was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the outperformance essentially all coming from revenue. Rent and lease pricing for the third quarter was 5% higher than projections, supported by an average physical occupancy about 50 basis points above projections. And as we expected, operating expense growth for the quarter moderated given some favorable prior year comparisons, but it is projected to return to the full year range during the fourth quarter. As you saw in the release, this third quarter performance produced a significant increase to both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased projected core FFO for the year to $6.94 per share, which is $0.19 per share above our prior midpoint and now represents a 7.9% growth over the prior year. The increase is driven by revised same-store revenue growth projection for the full year of 5.1% at the midpoint, which is based on continued strong pricing trends through the fourth quarter with some late seasonal moderation expected and we're assuming blended lease pricing averaging somewhere around 10% for full quarter. We left our operating expense expectation for the year unchanged at 4.25% and 4.75% growth which produces revised same-store NOI growth for the year of 5.5% at the midpoint. We do expect some growing pressure from operating expenses as we move into 2022 with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and real estate taxes which combined to make up over 2/3 of operating expenses, all expected to begin showing some inflationary increases during 2022. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We completed several important financing transactions during the third quarter, which further enhanced our strength. We issued a combined $600 million in public bonds during the quarter, a barbell deal pairing 5-year and 30-year notes, which had very good pricing for both, have lended to a 2.1% effective rate, which supports our view that our current ratings are conservative. These transactions also fixed over 99% of our debt and extended our average debt maturities to almost nine years, providing employee protection from a rising interest rate environment. We also executed an 18-month forward equity transaction which provides around $210 million of future funding for our growing development pipeline and based on current projections, this takes care of our equity needs for the next couple of years. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Mallory, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: We will now open the call up for questions.  We will take our first question from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: So obviously, because of that saying, unbelievable performance to this point. What concerns you though? I mean to me, this economy and this setup with wage growth and everything happening in a positive direction on top of the supply chain issues suggest at least a risk of -- if there is a new Fed Chairman name that we could see him or her showing might to combat what's going on and perhaps increase interest rates in the short end. I'm curious if you're worried about that. We got a GDP print for the third quarter of just 2%. Do you see these as the main kind of factors in terms of the risks going forward, because obviously, this type of growth can't happen forever?\nEric Bolton: Well, Rich, yes, I mean I think you're certainly hitting on some of the bigger variables that could change that would change the dynamic that we're operating within. I do think that we believe that if we do find ourselves in a rising rate environment, that first, this business that we're in, the apartment business offers, I think, some degree of hedge against rising pricing and rising cost in general as we have the ability to sort of reprice our service and our product pretty quickly. Al and Andrew have done a terrific job of the balance sheet. We've got the -- all the metrics in a very, very strong position and I think, in a position to withstand pressures that we may see a various sorts in the capital markets. So I think that -- and then I think some of the supply chain issues that we've been referencing will continue to be with us for some time. Eventually, that get fixed, but I think it's going to be a while happening probably a couple of years or so. And that may -- it will create some issues for us. But I think it will also potentially cause some delays in deliveries of some of the competing supply that may be coming into the market. So there's -- it's hard to sort of underwrite things right now. There's -- and obviously, there's just a whole lot of noise coming out of Washington, D.C. these days and discussions surrounding changes in tax policies and what degree that may or may not affect the economy and capital and how capital chooses to allocate and invest. So I think there are a lot of worry beads out there in that regard. And from our perspective, we've long believed that the right thing for us to do is just simply orient our capital towards markets where we believe the demand for what we do is likely to be the most stable and the strongest over a full year over a full cycle. You've over the years have heard that -- me oftentimes make reference to the notion that we're trying to be the best full cycle performer we can be. And I think it starts, frankly, with protecting the downside in protecting against risk. And for that reason, that's why we focus the way we do on the Sunbelt and have for 27 years. And then it's also, frankly, why we choose to allocate capital the way we do across the region with a real bend towards both a healthy combination of larger markets as well as secondary markets and with an affordable price point, we think it all just combines to create a higher degree of appeal for our product and thereby sort of sort of drive more stability and the ability to weather down cycles better. I'm excited about the opportunities that are coming in terms of the emerging recovery cycle, and we've got some exciting things happening with development. We've got ample capacity and strengthen the balance sheet to cover risks surrounding that. We've got some pretty exciting things we're doing with redevelopment, which are going to drive revenue growth opportunities off our existing asset base. And then we've got some exciting things we're doing with technology then I think it could continue to create performance advantages for us in the markets where we do business. So, I feel like we're probably as well positioned as we could be for whatever the future holds. And time will tell.\nRich Anderson: That's great, Eric. And just a quick one maybe for Tom. With everything going up in price, including apartment rents, have you seen any indication that people are starting to at least consider doubling up to save some money? Has there been any more of that happening in your portfolio to this point?\nTom Grimes: No, Rich. It's -- the sort of popularity has stayed sort of the same with 1s and 2s being most popular and the efficiency is still the least, only 4% exposure to those in their mid-teens on rent growth, and they're above 95% occupied. So, we're there. But I mean, we they really -- we see people staying put. Our renewal conversations though at higher rates than they've ever been or easier because everybody sees the noise in the market and the price of single-family homes and those kind of things, so there has not been a retrenchment. And then on -- as far as affordability goes, we continue to stay in the same area where we've been in that 21%, 22% range. So, our sense is salaries are adjusting and folks are continuing as is.\nOperator: We'll go to now Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Just based on the October stats that you gave, it doesn't really seem like there was any seasonality hitting those numbers yet. So then you talked about that 14% averaging out to more like 10% over the whole fourth quarter. So are you seeing preliminary signs of seasonality. Am I interpreting that correctly?\nAl Campbell: I think -- Brad, this is Al. I'll take that in those comments as my comments. I think what we have put into our expectations is continued strong trends. I mean October was a little ahead of the quarter, as you mentioned. And so we're seeing that in October, maybe into November, but we do believe there's going to be some seasonal, call it, holiday moderation even as we get into the last month of the quarter we put that in the forecast. And so that kind of brings us to that 10% average. But I'll say this, but also -- the fourth quarter is the lowest number of leases that we do for any other quarter. And so, even if it's a little higher, a little bit lower, it really won't have that big of an impact on that performance. And so we feel like that was the right range to put in.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then I appreciate the comment just now on rent income that it hasn't really moved around that much. Can you just talk about, I guess, what the underlying driver for that is? It just seems surprising if you have new lease up 20% and some of these blended numbers up 15%, like it doesn't seem like the underlying wages would have kept pace with that.\nTom Grimes: Yes. And Tim has some more detailed data on this. But roughly, from '19 to '20, it's moved probably 150, 200 basis points, but it has not moved material, and it's still incredibly affordable. So, it is a shift or what we're seeing is the people coming in the front door are more qualified. So it may not be the rate. It may not be salaries that are coming up, but the people that we are attracting are easily able to pay for the rent.\nTim Argo: I'll add one comment to that. I mean if we go back to the Q3 of '19, two years ago, income for our residents has gone up about 17%. So while rents have increased quite a bit, our incomes have as well. We're not seeing a huge difference in terms of the type of resident where they work, similar sector, a lot of professional services, a lot of financial, a lot of health care. But we are seeing a little more single, slightly younger actually we moved from, call it, 75% single to about 82% single. But overall, incomes are generally keeping pace with great growth.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph from Citi. Your line is open.\nNick Joseph: Maybe just following up on the seasonality. What's the loss to lease for the total portfolio today?\nTim Argo: Nick, this is Tim. I'll answer that. We look at it a couple of different ways. But if you take all of those leases that went into effect in September, so new leases and renewals, and compare that to our September ERU or all in-place leases in September, it's about 11% or so, if you look at it that way. And obviously, that changes daily. If you have the same question in December, probably a little bit different answer. The other thing I'll add, if you -- the way we think about it is how is that earned in or baked in to play into 2022. So if you look at our 10% blended lease or release guidance that we gave for the full year 2021, with most leases being on average, 12 months or so, we would expect about half of that to carry into next year. So earned in or baked in rate growth of about 5% right now heading into '22.\nNick Joseph: That's very helpful. And then you made a comment about the supply chain disruptions and the impact. How does that impact your market supply expectations for 2022?\nEric Bolton: Well, it's kind of hard to give you any real specifics on that, Nick, but I would generally tell you that as this supply chain issue continues to prolong in terms of an impact, I've got to believe that it's going to create some construction delays for some of the projects underway. I mean, we just we were anxious about delivering some heart plan siding at one of our projects in Austin that we currently have under construction, and we were really reaching a deadline in the last two or three weeks where we were going to have to make a decision to either hold out and wait and create a delay or make a change to a different type of siding just because we couldn't get the order in. And at the last minute, it did come in thankfully. And so everything is still on schedule there. But I -- we're hearing more and more discussion about material delays and challenges. And of course, it's been that way for some time over the course of the past year with appliances and other things, but we're hearing it more broad spread and more -- including more items than ever. And I just -- I think that as we get into next year, if it continues at the trends that we're currently seeing, I got to believe that supply coming into the markets next year is going to be a little bit below current expectations.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChandni Luthra: Thank you. Good morning. This is Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. And congratulations on a really strong quarter. Could you perhaps talk about -- you said that you think that given your balance sheet you could get aggressive on development. Could you perhaps give us some color on where do you think development can go for you in this part of the cycle as we think about, say, as a percentage of enterprise value?\nEric Bolton: Well, this is Eric. And one thing I will say, we do not intend to -- I wouldn't use the word aggressive. We intend to be very not -- I mean, we will see some growth take place with our development pipeline, currently, including our lease-up, we're sitting on about $700 million of total funding. We funded a good portion of that at this point. And as Brad alluded to, we've got several projects that are getting teed up that we would likely pull the trigger on in 2022. I wouldn't be surprised to see the overall aggregate, if you will, amount of development to get to $1 billion, maybe a little bit over $1 billion. But recognize that the actual funding obligation in a given calendar year for that kind of pipeline is going to be approaching $400 million or something of that nature is something that we're very, very comfortable in dealing with. But in terms of enterprise value, if we get to $1 billion on a $28 billion or so sort of enterprise value balance sheet, we think that, that's still very comfortable and something that we're very comfortable executing on.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. That's great color. And then you briefly talked about sort of cap rates seeing further downward pressure earlier in the call. I mean, can you give a little -- can you throw a little bit more light there? What are you seeing? How much compression are we talking about? And what's that doing to your yield expectations?\nBrad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. I can give you a little bit of color to that. If we go back to, call it, first quarter of this year, cap rates on new deals in the market that we were underwriting and looking at, cap rates were about 4%. Second quarter, they were at, call it, 3.75%. This quarter, that's down to about 3.25%. And these are really trailing three-month cap rates. So these are trailing cap rates that we're looking at. So you can see in the last quarter, we've seen probably a 50 basis points or so further compression of cap rates versus what we saw in the second quarter. So we continue to see a significant amount of capital looking in our markets, looking for to deploy for reasons I mentioned in my comments. So, we don't see any reason on the horizon right now that that is going to stop. In fact, we are hearing more and more stories from our brokers that we're talking to that cap rates are in the mid- to upper twos in some of the markets, depending on what the growth looks like. So again, as I mentioned last quarter, I think from here, it feels like cap rates probably come down a little bit more. But we have certainly seen, as we get later in the year and as often is the case, we have seen bid sheets lighten up a little bit. Some of that is because we've had a historical amount of volume this year. So folks maybe have met their allocation or maybe there's just a little bit of deal fatigue as we get later in the year. But Nevertheless, the pricing that the winning bidder is willing to pay is -- continues to be aggressive driving those cap rates down.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So Al, you mentioned that the 10% blended lease pricing in 4Q was baked into the guidance despite kind of where you're tracking at this point through October. I'm curious, did you assume any additional moderation in occupancy? Or does it -- do you expect to kind of hold within that high 95% range through the balance of the year?\nAl Campbell: We definitely put our guidance -- you've seen our update Austin. We expect to average for the year about 96%. So down a little bit from where we have been. But as Tom mentioned, October occupancy was down just a little bit. Nothing -- it's still in the high 95s. We expect something in the high 95%, something like that. But I think as we mentioned, the pricing growth that's the average for the whole quarter. Taking into account the last part of the quarter, which may be some seasonality, even call it, like we said, even holiday traffic really slows down during that period. But as we mentioned, it really shouldn't have that big impact from the quarter, not as much as we would in other quarters because there's just very few leases that are signed.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood. That's helpful. And then just switching over to development. A couple of questions. Eric, you mentioned the $1 billion, you've talked about it previously. I mean do you think that you can scale up to that level, to $1 billion or a little bit north of $1 billion, by next year? And then secondly, you guys have talked about the projects and lease-up being a drag this year, but even less of a drag next year, a drag still nonetheless, but with the rent growth that your markets have achieved relative to what you underwrote, could that now be a tailwind at this point into next year?\nEric Bolton: Well, in reference to your first question, yes, we're very comfortable with our ability to execute with a development operation that gets the pipeline to $1 billion, a little over $1 billion and recognize that we're doing it in two different ways. We've got an in-house platform where we've got in-house development and in-house construction oversight. Now we do not actually act as a general contractor ourselves. We always contract that with third-party general contractors. So we're not actually building it ourselves, but we are overseeing the construction. And then in addition to the in-house execution that we've got what we refer to as a pre-purchase program, we're essentially joint venturing with third-party developers, and they really do the construction. And a lot of the development work and we just oversee what they're doing. So yes, I mean, with the staffing that we have today, we feel very confident in our ability to execute at that kind of volume given the ways that we're doing that. And then -- I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what?\nAustin Wurschmidt: It was just on sort of the earnings contribution from the . Earlier in the year, you talked about it being a pretty significant drag this year and more modest drag next year, but still a drag. And I was just curious with the rent growth that your markets have achieved relative to what I presume you underwrote was much more conservative. I'm wondering if that's now a tailwind at this point.\nTim Argo: Austin, this is Tim. I mean, I think the key there is we've got we have three deals, I think, in that property pipeline that are -- that will move sort of -- that will complete here in the fourth quarter. And so still, even though we're certainly getting rents as good, if not better, than we had originally pro forma. There's still going to be for the bulk of next year, pretty low occupancy, you take some time to lease up. I think there'll still be a drag. But I do think we'll get to sort of that breakeven cost of capital yield a little bit quicker. So all in all, not as much of a drag as it would have been, but still be somewhat of a drag this year.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb: First -- two questions. First, was -- as you guys plan 2022, and obviously, you're not giving guidance now, but you had 8% blended spreads in the second quarter, 15% now. Obviously, on the sell side, we're all imagining where our numbers could go based on these trends. But internally, as you guys sit there and underwrite next year, how do you reasonably underwrite next year, given that historically, you're probably looking at 3%, 4%, maybe 5% rent growth, whereas now your teams are -- I mean presumably, you guys could be 10% rent growth for next year with these type of numbers and a loss to lease. So how do you comfortably underwrite next year without us saying, hey, you're sandbagging, or you guys saying, hey, we left our targets too low and our field team is going to clean up?\nEric Bolton: Well, we do it really, really thoughtfully and carefully. I'll say that. I mean we're in the middle of, frankly, of doing that right now. For us, it really starts with kind of a bottom-up approach, and we have a very robust budgeting process that we go through at a property-specific level. We look at all the supply dynamics. We think about the baked-in trends that we have. And we -- and then at a top level, we think about job growth, we think about sort of the variables that drive demand, all of which we think are going to continue to be very positive into next year. And then in addition to that, we also have the variables surrounding what we're doing with both new technologies and various things that we think are going to create some upside as well as what we're doing with both redevelopment and repositioning efforts. So there's a lot of variables that go into it, and we underwrite them each of those in very specific ways in order to build up to what we what we think is the right expectation to establish. So I think that, as Tim alluded to, I mean, we're going to obviously be carrying in some great baked in performance stronger than I've I can remember it ever being. And I think that we'll see where we get to. It's -- I'm not really going to be able to give you a specific answer, Alex, other than just to say we try to go at it in a very detailed fashion. And I think when we wrap up our process, which will be done leading up to a Board meeting we have in December. We'll -- it will be arrived at in a pretty thoughtful manner, I can assure you that.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Right. But it would seem like something upper single digits or 10%-ish for rent growth next year is not unreasonable. Would that be correct, Eric?\nEric Bolton: I mean it's -- with the baked in that we're looking at, coupled with some of the redevelopment and some of the market fundamentals, just assuming those continue to stay as strong as they are, I think what you're saying is not unreasonable. But we'll have more to say on that later.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is on cap rates. You -- obviously, we all know where cap rates have gone. But as far as the total IRR, have IRRs changed so that -- people are paying low 3s, you have 15% rent growth, et cetera. So have IRRs held firm? Or have you seen IRRs also compressing because the cap rate compression more than offsets any rent growth that people are baking in?\nBrad Hill: Well, this is Brad. I think it really depends on what your long-term rent growth outlook is certainly putting in one year of 15%, 20% rent growth helps. But what does that look like in years 2 through 10, I think that's really what's going to drive whether your IRRs are coming down or staying flat. I'd say, generally speaking, IRRs are coming down. But to what degree is going to depend on to what degree you believe this outsized rent growth is going to continue, certainly for a couple of years. But outside of that, you've got folks that are dialing in substantial rehab components on assets to help drive those rates up. So I'd say it just depends, but my general comment would be that IRRs are down to some degree.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. Your line is open.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Following up on that conversation on returns I may have misheard you in the prepared remarks, but it does sound like your tone has changed a bit on pursuing stabilized acquisitions. And if that's the case, what is giving you greater comfort today? Is it mainly being driven by that kind of continued improvement in your cost of capital?\nEric Bolton: Amanda, it's Eric. I think that -- I mean, obviously, the cost of capital factors into it in a big way. But I think that as we just feel like we're getting later into the cycle, supply and starts are -- have picked up a bit this year, and we'll get into more deliveries potentially next year. coupled with probably some growing levels of distress here and there, surrounding supply deliveries and supply chain challenges that we've been hitting on or talking about. I just think that we are getting more optimistic that we're going to see some struggling lease-up situations out there. And we really believe that, that is where we have the best opportunity to execute on an acquisition of a stabilized asset at a price point that we're comfortable executing with. And so, I just think the conditions are evolving to a point that you may see more distress with some of the stabilized assets, particularly lease-up assets, and we're optimistic that, that may yield an opportunity or two this next year.\nBrad Hill: Amanda, I'll add one thing to that. As we -- we're getting to a point, we are seeing select instances where there is some aspect of a transaction that appeals to a seller other than the highest price, whether it be a timing, a year-end close or something of that nature. And as Eric said, as we get into situations where some supply chains causes some delays, we are seeing folks using more pref equity, mezzanine equity, things of that nature. So their capital stack gets a little bit more expensive as those delays occur, which could open up some opportunities for us to take advantage of an opportunity here or there.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay. That makes sense. And then you also mentioned you're excited about your kind of next wave of tech initiatives. Can you talk about what those initiatives are after the Smart Home implementation is complete?\nEric Bolton: Amanda, I'll give you a kind of a quick update on what's going on. This year, we expanded our call center solution. We deployed lead nurturing software which is really just an automated prospect engagement tech that interacts with our prospects earlier and sort of extends the sales process. We upgraded our virtual touring, we launched mobile maintenance and mobile inspections. Sort of the next tools coming are improved self-touring, improved multi-location sales support to simplify online leasing this year, we were able to reduce 30 positions. Next year, we'd expect a headcount reduction, and we're doing this on natural turns. There's not a headcount reduction cost with this of about another . But in short, technology is just allowing us to shape and refine and change the resident journey so that every step of it is easier for the resident, which helps us capture them and help revenues and it's more efficient on the expense side as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Your line is open.\nRob Stevenson: You guys give guidance one year at a time, but presumably have some internal numbers run out several years at a time. Looks like given your guidance and what you did last year, you're going to average mid- to high 3% same-store revenue growth over the 2020, '21 period. When you're sitting back two years ago, Halloween 2019 before COVID, is this about where you guys expected to be in terms of portfolio rents and combined same-store growth over the two-year period? Or is there something here that some markets that have been disappointing, where you thought that you'd be higher than this, maybe a little lower than this? How would you sort of characterize that versus your own internal sort of budgeting over the 2021 period?\nEric Bolton: Well, that's an interesting question, Rob. I mean we certainly, in October 2019, did not foresee what happened over the last couple of years. I would tell you that, yes, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about a long-term sort of top line performance for our asset class. We would put it at -- call it, 3.5%, plus or minus, over a long period of time. And I think in a highly competitive business like ours, where pricing is part of the competition tool set. I just think that, that's a pretty reasonable assumption to make. And then our challenge as a management team is then to think about how do we take volatility out of that performance stream I think that, particularly as a REIT paying hopefully a steady growing dividend, it's really important to think about that. And that's why we have the strategy that we do in an effort to try to remove some of the volatility, but yet still be in a position to drive that kind of top line growth. Now we do believe that over time, also with platform capabilities that we should deliver results -- top line results that would be if you will, superior to normal market trends, both as a combination of just balance sheet strength we have, the technology platform that continues to build out and add capabilities, a very robust revenue management system. And then the things that we're doing with repositioning and redevelopment. So to say that over the last two years, at the end of the full two-year cycle, we achieved revenue growth that was kind of in line with where we thought we'd be in October 2019. That's probably not too far off. It's a little more volatile than we would have liked, but we got through it just fine.\nRob Stevenson: And any markets, based on that that have sort of disappointed, if I told you where you'd be operationally back in October 2019? Presumably supply markets, oversupplied markets were weaker, there were some issues like the DCs or the Houston, et cetera, but any markets that sort of stick out to you over the combined two-year period that are still either abnormally strong relative to what you would have thought or weaker than where you would have thought?\nEric Bolton: I mean, the markets that have just been incredibly strong for us and continue to be are -- particularly Phoenix and Tampa, I would point to. Orlando had a dip there that we never would have expected in October of 2019. Orlando is a market that dipped than we would have expected, and that was a lot of impact surrounding COVID and the shutdown of the entertainment and theme park businesses in that market. And Houston has been a bit of a laggard as well, more so than we would have expected. But I think that, broadly speaking, the portfolio did what we hoped it would do. And then some of our or secondary markets, markets like Greenville and Charleston and Savannah, Nashville, Jacksonville have continued to produce the kind of the more steady results that we count on during times of volatility. And Atlanta has been -- it was a little weaker earlier last year, but it's come back really strong. So I wouldn't point to anything really surprising other than just those few I mentioned there.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then lastly for me. Al, when you take a look at property taxes today, I mean, any of your markets where you've basically got a bull on your back given the increase in values, the trades in the market, rents are going, et cetera? Is there any markets where you're really seeing material upward pressure even despite the material upward pressure over, call it, the last almost decade?\nAl Campbell: I think I would say on that, Rob, is a combination of growing top line and great revenue growth and declining cap rates, as Brad talks about, has put pressure almost everywhere in our portfolio. There are areas that are more aggressive that we do expect more pressure. We talked often about particularly Texas and Florida. Those two are the most aggressive programs, and they're both combined a little over 50% of our tax liability. So we expect that to be the biggest area in 2022 to really a challenge. Now we'll fight everything as we do. And we'll see what happens. There's some factors that help us a bit in 2022, and then we'll have some areas that aren't assessing. I think Tennessee, North Carolina, they're not reassessing this year, parts of our Georgia portfolio because we've appealed and we've completed those, and there's kind of a lot for one year or two when you've completed appeals. So there some areas that are not going to see assessments that's going to be helpful, but Texas and Florida are going to really challenge us. And so we're preparing for that. And with the growing top line and driving cap rates you expect that we've talked about mid- to upper single-digit kind of expectations in some of those markets. And so that's what -- we'll have more to say about that as we end the year and put out guidance and it's certainly as we move into next year, but that's where the pressure should come from.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Powell: Just a question on the disposition to Savanna and Charlotte, just maybe cap rates there and I guess, why selling those properties? And what's your disposition to guess outlook for the next couple of years?\nBrad Hill: Yes. This is Brad. First, I'll just start with why those properties. But we go through a process every year where we -- there are obviously multiple departments here that we sit down with and kind of go through what we want to look to sell potentially for next year. That involves looking at properties that have cash flow and CapEx needs that are above what we're looking for in our overall portfolio has generally trend to older properties. We've got some where maybe there's some regulatory issues that we're looking at that we evaluate. We've got properties that are in markets where the rent growth is not really what we want it to be. So we go through that process every year really to identify the opportunities for us to sell for the following year. The other side of that is we're looking at what can we handle in terms of dilution and then what our cash flow needs for the year, our funding needs. So all of that kind of goes into our process, and we're in the process of doing that now for next year. So we'll certainly have more to say about that with our release for next year. But in terms of what we're selling this year, the two in Savannah, the one in Charlotte, we raised our guidance in terms of that. Pricing was quite a bit higher than what we expected, frankly. The way we look at our pricing on these assets is we're looking at a yield our trailing 12-month NOI yield and what we're getting on the proceeds there. And from that basis, we're getting about a 4.2% yield on those. And just for cap rate comparison purposes, just so you can compare across markets that's about a, call it, a 3.25 to 3.5 market cap rate. So very good pricing that we're able to achieve. And just as a reminder, those are 31-year-old assets that we're selling in those markets. And so very, very strong pricing that we're seeing.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alex Kalmus from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nAlex Kalmus: I wanted to double click on the struggling lease acquisition targets you mentioned earlier. Given just the robust revenue growth you're getting, it's hard to imagine that lease-ups would be struggling. I'm curious what's driving that, in your opinion? Is it the cost side? Is it unknowledgeable outsiders marketing in the market? What's driving the opportunity?\nEric Bolton: Well, just to confirm, I mean, our lease-ups are actually not struggling. Our lease-ups are running well ahead of expectations in terms of our pro forma and both in the leasing velocity and rents that we're getting what I was making reference to was out in the market, if you will, as we get later into the cycle, I think that there are some other development projects that are out there that may start to run into some challenges surrounding supply chain delivery issues late deliveries. And I was suggesting that some of that may come into play with other third-party developers that are out there that may then drive some purchasing opportunities for us as we get into next year. But our lease-ups are actually doing very well and better than we expected. So just -- that's what I was referencing. We're not talking about struggling lease. So it's not ours. I'm talking about some others as we get it later into next year.\nAlex Kalmus: Right. Right. Yes. I was referring to the potential opportunity set for acquiring those, not your own but thanks for clarifying. And just looking at the where the demand is coming from? You mentioned the out-of-state relocations are doing well and moving out to single families down. What about the shift between apartment renters within the market? Are you noticing a trend where they may be within the apartment renters that going a little more suburban or any other trends there?\nEric Bolton: No. The trend has continued on urban versus suburban back in 2021 -- or in 2020 it sort of peaked there. The pricing gap there was 260 basis points as suburban, I would say, it's safe to say was favored and urban was affected a little bit more by supply, that's narrowed to 60 basis points, and both are excellent now. So we're seeing -- and we saw that with AB assets. The delta has just closed and the strength is across the board now. So both AB and urban suburban assets are within the norm of our blended rent growth for the quarter for 15-plus percent growth. So that delta has closed.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Your line is open.\nJohn Pawlowski: Brad, just one clarifying question on the cap rates you referenced for Charlotte and Savannah,  on trailing 12 months, but the -- was it the -- or was it the buyer kind of market cap rate that you're referring to in the low threes once you adjust for tax reinsurance. Is that accurate?\nBrad Hill: Yes, that's correct.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then, Al, you mentioned growing personnel pressure you expect over the coming years. Could you just give us a bit more detail? Are we talking closer to 5% or 15%? Just order of magnitude, what you expect in terms of personnel cost pressures?\nBrad Hill: I mean I would refer to the three primary areas that I've talked about, John. And all of them, the three -- probably the largest expense categories we have or close to it. I'd say I would look at personnel, whereas repair maintenance and taxes, all of those combined, there are probably 2/3 of our expenses mentioned those. And on personnel, obviously, and I'll let Tom give the details, it's just challenging today to keep our workforce to keep all the positions we need, and it's very competitive, and you may have more details on exactly what that will be next year. We haven't really -- we're going through the details now to look at property by property, market by market, the challenges we're seeing. So -- We'll have more to say about that when we put our fourth quarter out. But in all of those categories, you're looking at, call it, a mid-single-digit kind of number likely for 2022, somewhere plus or minus something for all three of those.\nEric Bolton: Yes. John, this is Eric. I mean the thing I would tell you is that what we're obviously working to do to combat some of the pressures on labor costs with -- among our own workforce is we are continuing to introduce more technologies that are, frankly, allowing us the opportunity to eliminate positions we eliminated leasing positions this year, we'll probably be looking at eliminating close to 50 next year through attrition. And I think that there are various things that we're doing like that in an effort to sort of react to not only opportunity surrounding new technology that's coming into becoming available. But in an effort to sort of push back some of the pressures surrounding what's happening in the labor markets, broadly speaking, where we probably to date experienced the most pressure from a labor cost perspective is on contract labor we are forced to go out and hire third-party vendors or third-party contractors to come in and do certain activities that's where we've seen more of the pressure from a labor perspective. But we believe that through various programs that we have within our company from an HR perspective, coupled with the efforts that we've got underway with new technologies and the ability to get more efficient with our headcount levels that we'll probably keep the labor cost itself. I'm going to put it in probably a 4% to 5% range would be, I would think, comfortable to be able to deliver on that kind of performance.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Historically, you've been able to push renewals either than new lease rates, just given the cost and inconvenience for residents to move around. When do you think that environment returns?\nEric Bolton: John, right now, we're -- as you mentioned, we're probably $300 behind on renewals of where we would historically be. So that opportunity is still to be captured. And I would -- as long -- right now, new lease rates are moving at such a pace -- it is -- we are behind the mark on renewals. It is honestly pretty difficult to predict when that gap closes, but we're encouraged by the trajectory.\nBrad Hill: And behind the mark, meaning that the new lease prices for new move-in customers is $300 more than what we're charging on a renewal lease. And frankly, as long as the demand level stays as high as it is, and we get the tailwinds from the migration trends and what's happening with single-family housing and so on and so forth. We think that, that probably fuels ability to continue to command a higher price, if you will, from a new move-in customer on a new lease. So when that changes and we go back to a scenario where renewal pricing is exceeding on an absolute dollar amount exceeding what we're charging new customers, hard to forecast, but we don't see it happening anytime in the next year or so.\nJohn Kim: And on the rent growth, I don't know if you still look at your portfolio as cost versus legacy MAA, but is there any difference between rent growth in Class A and Class B, just given supply in the market and affordability concerns?\nEric Bolton: There was, John. I mean on AB assets back in the fourth quarter of 2020, the gap was 310 basis points, and it's closed to about 70 basis points now with both very strong at 14.7% and 15.4%. So it is -- it's really more a market differentiation on performance than an asset class or urban suburban at this point. It has been very strong consistently.\nJohn Kim: Class A getting the higher rent growth or Class B?\nEric Bolton: Class A is 14.7%, Class B is 15.4%.\nBrad Hill: It's really -- where you see pressure on Class A is not so much a market function. It's more a supply issue. Whenever you see new supply coming into the market, more often than not, it is going to have a price point associated with the new construction in a location, frankly, oftentimes, that it's going to be a more direct competitor to our existing A-class product, A class portfolio. So to some degree, the performance delta is more a function of supply coming to the market and which part of our portfolio -- a price point of our portfolio is more likely to impact.\nJohn Kim: And are the developers of these new projects, are they offering concessions?\nBrad Hill: It varies. In some locations, they do and some they don't. It's hard to give you a widespread. I would tell you that the presence of concessions in the market generally does not exist today versus a year ago. And so broadly, concessions are -- you don't really see that much of the market anywhere at this point.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotia Bank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Al, I just wanted to go back to the expense topic for next year. I mean, it sounds like should we think about expense growth starting at 5% as a reasonable number higher than this year overall?\nAl Campbell: Yes. And that was really -- that's a good question, Nick. That's really kind of the point I was trying to get across earlier is that those three -- when you take those three largest areas we talked about, that's now we're 2/3 of the expenses and you've got that mid-single digits kind of number, that's certainly reasonable. And we'll have more to say about that as we move -- as we give our guidance, but that is going to be -- those three are going to be big drivers for next year and the pressure that we see on expenses.\nNick Yulico: Okay. And then my second question is just on rental pricing and how we should think about this because in the third quarter, right, you had -- blended pricing was up 16% -- I'm sorry, that was October 16%. I think it was 15% for the third quarter. When we look at some of the industry data, a year ago, rents in your markets were kind of not up -- they weren't really impacted here. They were sort of slightly down year-over-year or maybe flattish -- and so it really feels like what's happening here in this quarter right now is you have this comparison period where the numbers are very high because a year ago, there was no rent growth. And so you're almost getting like two years of rent growth in one quarter or in October right now. And so as we just kind of think about where rents could be trending going forward, realizing there's -- eventually hit some comp issues next year in the second quarter, third quarter because you had very strong quarters this year for markets. But really the way -- is it the right way for us to think about blended pricing right now is something like half of what the number is, so it's maybe really 7% to 8% on an annual basis, not -- because it's not -- it's very hard to see how it continues at 15%. But is there a reasonable thing to think that, really, on an annual basis, it's sort of half of that right now?\nEric Bolton: Well, Nick, this is Eric. It's kind of hard to answer that specifically. The thing -- let me break it down this way and explain to you the renewal pricing performance is driven by a different set of factors. Renewal pricing as we've alluded to earlier in one of the earlier questions, it has a lot more influence rounding the ability for us to be a little bit more aggressive there because people really just want to avoid the hassle of moving obviously, supply-demand dynamics factor into what we can do on renewal pricing to some degree as well. But also, are they happy, have we done a good job of keeping them serviced and responsive to their needs and so on and so forth. So I think that what we find is that renewal pricing which is, call it, roughly half or so of the blended performance is it tends to be a lot more stable and tends to be a lot steadier, if you will, over the course of the year. And I would tell you that back to what Tom was mentioning a moment ago, when you look at the absolute rent amount that is being charged for new moving customers versus the absolute rent amount being charged for renewal customers there is room to continue to push pretty hard on the renewal pricing without eclipsing or going above the new lease pricing. So we think that the outlook and the trajectory for renewal pricing is likely to remain fairly stable and growing and positive more or less consistent with what we're seeing now and don't really see why that would materially weaken. New lease pricing for new customers coming in tends to be a much more volatile number. And not only do you have market dynamics that come into play there, but you've also got seasonal factors that work into the equation a little bit. And so I think that as we think about what's driving rent growth this year and particularly as it relates to new lease pricing, new customers moving in. There is some of the COVID unbundling, if you will, that's going on that, as you point out, will start to taper off, if you will, at some point. But the other variables surrounding job growth, migration trends, the inability for people to go out and buy homes at pricing that has gotten above what they can afford and so forth. Those variables are likely to continue for some time as we see. And certainly, overall migration trends, the demand for apartment housing across our region has continued to be very robust. So I think that new lease pricing is probably inflated a little bit right now as a consequence of sort of coming out of COVID. And so to some degree, if you want to think about moderation taking place as we get sort of past the code at influence altogether, it probably does show up a little bit more so in new lease pricing and to put a number to that right now is kind of hard because we don't know which of those variables is necessarily creating the most impact. I would tell you, probably as job growth and migration trends and what's happening to single-family housing more so than any sort of COVID unbundling effect that's going on.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will return the call over to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: No closing remarks. We appreciate everyone joining us and, obviously, follow up with any questions you may have. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Our third quarter results were well ahead of expectations. Growing demand across our Sunbelt markets continues to drive strong rent growth and high occupancy, steady job growth, favorable migration trends, wage growth and escalating pricing of single-family housing are all driving strong performance for apartment rents across our portfolio. We're carrying significant pricing momentum into calendar year '22. Resident turnover remains low. Collections remain strong, occupancy is high and rent-to-income ratios remain very affordable. This all suggests to us that we have good capacity in the market for the pricing trends that we are currently capturing. As we think about next year, we believe leasing conditions across our markets will remain favorable. Our Sunbelt markets continue to capture good job growth, driving positive migration trends. New move-ins year-to-date from households relocating to our Sunbelt markets constitute 14% of our new leases as compared to just over 10% in the same time frame of 2020. High pricing trends associated with single-family housing are further supporting strong demand for apartment housing. In the third quarter, move-outs among our resident base to buy a home were down 12% as compared to prior year, and move-outs to rent a home were down 38%. We continue to keep an eye on pressure surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. Year-to-date, our biggest pressure on operating expenses is building repairs and maintenance costs, which are up just over 6%. Pressure is associated with both materials and labor. We expect year-over-year increases in repair and maintenance expenses will likely hold in the 6% range through the end of the year. Our current development pipeline remains on budget for both development costs and timing for unit deliveries. We're working into our planning and pro formas more cost and unit delivery contingencies as we expect the supply chain challenges to be with us through next year. But again, at this point, our current predevelopment pipeline remains fully on track and we expect to start several additional new projects in 2022. In summary, our markets continue to capture strong demand driving robust rent growth that will carry into 2022. And MAA's uniquely diversified approach across the Sunbelt region, supported by a very strong balance sheet, has the Company well positioned to take advantage of the outlook for continued strong leasing fundamentals in our markets. We continue to build strength in our technology platform and their operating capabilities. Our redevelopment program and several repositioning projects will drive higher earnings opportunity from our existing portfolio. We expect to capture meaningful expansion in our operating margins over the next couple of years. In addition, our external growth pipeline continues to expand and will deliver meaningful value accretion over the coming years. MAA is well positioned heading into 2022 and we're excited about the prospects for continued outperformance in the coming year. I'd like to thank the MAA team for the tremendous progress this year and the very positive results. I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom? Well, Rich, yes, I mean I think you're certainly hitting on some of the bigger variables that could change that would change the dynamic that we're operating within. I do think that we believe that if we do find ourselves in a rising rate environment, that first, this business that we're in, the apartment business offers, I think, some degree of hedge against rising pricing and rising cost in general as we have the ability to sort of reprice our service and our product pretty quickly. Al and Andrew have done a terrific job of the balance sheet. We've got the -- all the metrics in a very, very strong position and I think, in a position to withstand pressures that we may see a various sorts in the capital markets. So I think that -- and then I think some of the supply chain issues that we've been referencing will continue to be with us for some time. Eventually, that get fixed, but I think it's going to be a while happening probably a couple of years or so. And that may -- it will create some issues for us. But I think it will also potentially cause some delays in deliveries of some of the competing supply that may be coming into the market. So there's -- it's hard to sort of underwrite things right now. There's -- and obviously, there's just a whole lot of noise coming out of Washington, D.C. these days and discussions surrounding changes in tax policies and what degree that may or may not affect the economy and capital and how capital chooses to allocate and invest. So I think there are a lot of worry beads out there in that regard. And from our perspective, we've long believed that the right thing for us to do is just simply orient our capital towards markets where we believe the demand for what we do is likely to be the most stable and the strongest over a full year over a full cycle. You've over the years have heard that -- me oftentimes make reference to the notion that we're trying to be the best full cycle performer we can be. And I think it starts, frankly, with protecting the downside in protecting against risk. And for that reason, that's why we focus the way we do on the Sunbelt and have for 27 years. And then it's also, frankly, why we choose to allocate capital the way we do across the region with a real bend towards both a healthy combination of larger markets as well as secondary markets and with an affordable price point, we think it all just combines to create a higher degree of appeal for our product and thereby sort of sort of drive more stability and the ability to weather down cycles better. I'm excited about the opportunities that are coming in terms of the emerging recovery cycle, and we've got some exciting things happening with development. We've got ample capacity and strengthen the balance sheet to cover risks surrounding that. We've got some pretty exciting things we're doing with redevelopment, which are going to drive revenue growth opportunities off our existing asset base. And then we've got some exciting things we're doing with technology then I think it could continue to create performance advantages for us in the markets where we do business. So, I feel like we're probably as well positioned as we could be for whatever the future holds. And time will tell. Well, it's kind of hard to give you any real specifics on that, Nick, but I would generally tell you that as this supply chain issue continues to prolong in terms of an impact, I've got to believe that it's going to create some construction delays for some of the projects underway. I mean, we just we were anxious about delivering some heart plan siding at one of our projects in Austin that we currently have under construction, and we were really reaching a deadline in the last two or three weeks where we were going to have to make a decision to either hold out and wait and create a delay or make a change to a different type of siding just because we couldn't get the order in. And at the last minute, it did come in thankfully. And so everything is still on schedule there. But I -- we're hearing more and more discussion about material delays and challenges. And of course, it's been that way for some time over the course of the past year with appliances and other things, but we're hearing it more broad spread and more -- including more items than ever. And I just -- I think that as we get into next year, if it continues at the trends that we're currently seeing, I got to believe that supply coming into the markets next year is going to be a little bit below current expectations. Well, this is Eric. And one thing I will say, we do not intend to -- I wouldn't use the word aggressive. We intend to be very not -- I mean, we will see some growth take place with our development pipeline, currently, including our lease-up, we're sitting on about $700 million of total funding. We funded a good portion of that at this point. And as Brad alluded to, we've got several projects that are getting teed up that we would likely pull the trigger on in 2022. I wouldn't be surprised to see the overall aggregate, if you will, amount of development to get to $1 billion, maybe a little bit over $1 billion. But recognize that the actual funding obligation in a given calendar year for that kind of pipeline is going to be approaching $400 million or something of that nature is something that we're very, very comfortable in dealing with. But in terms of enterprise value, if we get to $1 billion on a $28 billion or so sort of enterprise value balance sheet, we think that, that's still very comfortable and something that we're very comfortable executing on. Well, in reference to your first question, yes, we're very comfortable with our ability to execute with a development operation that gets the pipeline to $1 billion, a little over $1 billion and recognize that we're doing it in two different ways. We've got an in-house platform where we've got in-house development and in-house construction oversight. Now we do not actually act as a general contractor ourselves. We always contract that with third-party general contractors. So we're not actually building it ourselves, but we are overseeing the construction. And then in addition to the in-house execution that we've got what we refer to as a pre-purchase program, we're essentially joint venturing with third-party developers, and they really do the construction. And a lot of the development work and we just oversee what they're doing. So yes, I mean, with the staffing that we have today, we feel very confident in our ability to execute at that kind of volume given the ways that we're doing that. And then -- I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what? Well, we do it really, really thoughtfully and carefully. I'll say that. I mean we're in the middle of, frankly, of doing that right now. For us, it really starts with kind of a bottom-up approach, and we have a very robust budgeting process that we go through at a property-specific level. We look at all the supply dynamics. We think about the baked-in trends that we have. And we -- and then at a top level, we think about job growth, we think about sort of the variables that drive demand, all of which we think are going to continue to be very positive into next year. And then in addition to that, we also have the variables surrounding what we're doing with both new technologies and various things that we think are going to create some upside as well as what we're doing with both redevelopment and repositioning efforts. So there's a lot of variables that go into it, and we underwrite them each of those in very specific ways in order to build up to what we what we think is the right expectation to establish. So I think that, as Tim alluded to, I mean, we're going to obviously be carrying in some great baked in performance stronger than I've I can remember it ever being. And I think that we'll see where we get to. It's -- I'm not really going to be able to give you a specific answer, Alex, other than just to say we try to go at it in a very detailed fashion. And I think when we wrap up our process, which will be done leading up to a Board meeting we have in December. We'll -- it will be arrived at in a pretty thoughtful manner, I can assure you that. I mean it's -- with the baked in that we're looking at, coupled with some of the redevelopment and some of the market fundamentals, just assuming those continue to stay as strong as they are, I think what you're saying is not unreasonable. But we'll have more to say on that later. Amanda, it's Eric. I think that -- I mean, obviously, the cost of capital factors into it in a big way. But I think that as we just feel like we're getting later into the cycle, supply and starts are -- have picked up a bit this year, and we'll get into more deliveries potentially next year. coupled with probably some growing levels of distress here and there, surrounding supply deliveries and supply chain challenges that we've been hitting on or talking about. I just think that we are getting more optimistic that we're going to see some struggling lease-up situations out there. And we really believe that, that is where we have the best opportunity to execute on an acquisition of a stabilized asset at a price point that we're comfortable executing with. And so, I just think the conditions are evolving to a point that you may see more distress with some of the stabilized assets, particularly lease-up assets, and we're optimistic that, that may yield an opportunity or two this next year. Amanda, I'll give you a kind of a quick update on what's going on. This year, we expanded our call center solution. We deployed lead nurturing software which is really just an automated prospect engagement tech that interacts with our prospects earlier and sort of extends the sales process. We upgraded our virtual touring, we launched mobile maintenance and mobile inspections. Sort of the next tools coming are improved self-touring, improved multi-location sales support to simplify online leasing this year, we were able to reduce 30 positions. Next year, we'd expect a headcount reduction, and we're doing this on natural turns. There's not a headcount reduction cost with this of about another . But in short, technology is just allowing us to shape and refine and change the resident journey so that every step of it is easier for the resident, which helps us capture them and help revenues and it's more efficient on the expense side as well. Well, that's an interesting question, Rob. I mean we certainly, in October 2019, did not foresee what happened over the last couple of years. I would tell you that, yes, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about a long-term sort of top line performance for our asset class. We would put it at -- call it, 3.5%, plus or minus, over a long period of time. And I think in a highly competitive business like ours, where pricing is part of the competition tool set. I just think that, that's a pretty reasonable assumption to make. And then our challenge as a management team is then to think about how do we take volatility out of that performance stream I think that, particularly as a REIT paying hopefully a steady growing dividend, it's really important to think about that. And that's why we have the strategy that we do in an effort to try to remove some of the volatility, but yet still be in a position to drive that kind of top line growth. Now we do believe that over time, also with platform capabilities that we should deliver results -- top line results that would be if you will, superior to normal market trends, both as a combination of just balance sheet strength we have, the technology platform that continues to build out and add capabilities, a very robust revenue management system. And then the things that we're doing with repositioning and redevelopment. So to say that over the last two years, at the end of the full two-year cycle, we achieved revenue growth that was kind of in line with where we thought we'd be in October 2019. That's probably not too far off. It's a little more volatile than we would have liked, but we got through it just fine. I mean, the markets that have just been incredibly strong for us and continue to be are -- particularly Phoenix and Tampa, I would point to. Orlando had a dip there that we never would have expected in October of 2019. Orlando is a market that dipped than we would have expected, and that was a lot of impact surrounding COVID and the shutdown of the entertainment and theme park businesses in that market. And Houston has been a bit of a laggard as well, more so than we would have expected. But I think that, broadly speaking, the portfolio did what we hoped it would do. And then some of our or secondary markets, markets like Greenville and Charleston and Savannah, Nashville, Jacksonville have continued to produce the kind of the more steady results that we count on during times of volatility. And Atlanta has been -- it was a little weaker earlier last year, but it's come back really strong. So I wouldn't point to anything really surprising other than just those few I mentioned there. Well, just to confirm, I mean, our lease-ups are actually not struggling. Our lease-ups are running well ahead of expectations in terms of our pro forma and both in the leasing velocity and rents that we're getting what I was making reference to was out in the market, if you will, as we get later into the cycle, I think that there are some other development projects that are out there that may start to run into some challenges surrounding supply chain delivery issues late deliveries. And I was suggesting that some of that may come into play with other third-party developers that are out there that may then drive some purchasing opportunities for us as we get into next year. But our lease-ups are actually doing very well and better than we expected. So just -- that's what I was referencing. We're not talking about struggling lease. So it's not ours. I'm talking about some others as we get it later into next year. No. The trend has continued on urban versus suburban back in 2021 -- or in 2020 it sort of peaked there. The pricing gap there was 260 basis points as suburban, I would say, it's safe to say was favored and urban was affected a little bit more by supply, that's narrowed to 60 basis points, and both are excellent now. So we're seeing -- and we saw that with AB assets. The delta has just closed and the strength is across the board now. So both AB and urban suburban assets are within the norm of our blended rent growth for the quarter for 15-plus percent growth. So that delta has closed. Yes. John, this is Eric. I mean the thing I would tell you is that what we're obviously working to do to combat some of the pressures on labor costs with -- among our own workforce is we are continuing to introduce more technologies that are, frankly, allowing us the opportunity to eliminate positions we eliminated leasing positions this year, we'll probably be looking at eliminating close to 50 next year through attrition. And I think that there are various things that we're doing like that in an effort to sort of react to not only opportunity surrounding new technology that's coming into becoming available. But in an effort to sort of push back some of the pressures surrounding what's happening in the labor markets, broadly speaking, where we probably to date experienced the most pressure from a labor cost perspective is on contract labor we are forced to go out and hire third-party vendors or third-party contractors to come in and do certain activities that's where we've seen more of the pressure from a labor perspective. But we believe that through various programs that we have within our company from an HR perspective, coupled with the efforts that we've got underway with new technologies and the ability to get more efficient with our headcount levels that we'll probably keep the labor cost itself. I'm going to put it in probably a 4% to 5% range would be, I would think, comfortable to be able to deliver on that kind of performance. John, right now, we're -- as you mentioned, we're probably $300 behind on renewals of where we would historically be. So that opportunity is still to be captured. And I would -- as long -- right now, new lease rates are moving at such a pace -- it is -- we are behind the mark on renewals. It is honestly pretty difficult to predict when that gap closes, but we're encouraged by the trajectory. There was, John. I mean on AB assets back in the fourth quarter of 2020, the gap was 310 basis points, and it's closed to about 70 basis points now with both very strong at 14.7% and 15.4%. So it is -- it's really more a market differentiation on performance than an asset class or urban suburban at this point. It has been very strong consistently. Class A is 14.7%, Class B is 15.4%. Well, Nick, this is Eric. It's kind of hard to answer that specifically. The thing -- let me break it down this way and explain to you the renewal pricing performance is driven by a different set of factors. Renewal pricing as we've alluded to earlier in one of the earlier questions, it has a lot more influence rounding the ability for us to be a little bit more aggressive there because people really just want to avoid the hassle of moving obviously, supply-demand dynamics factor into what we can do on renewal pricing to some degree as well. But also, are they happy, have we done a good job of keeping them serviced and responsive to their needs and so on and so forth. So I think that what we find is that renewal pricing which is, call it, roughly half or so of the blended performance is it tends to be a lot more stable and tends to be a lot steadier, if you will, over the course of the year. And I would tell you that back to what Tom was mentioning a moment ago, when you look at the absolute rent amount that is being charged for new moving customers versus the absolute rent amount being charged for renewal customers there is room to continue to push pretty hard on the renewal pricing without eclipsing or going above the new lease pricing. So we think that the outlook and the trajectory for renewal pricing is likely to remain fairly stable and growing and positive more or less consistent with what we're seeing now and don't really see why that would materially weaken. New lease pricing for new customers coming in tends to be a much more volatile number. And not only do you have market dynamics that come into play there, but you've also got seasonal factors that work into the equation a little bit. And so I think that as we think about what's driving rent growth this year and particularly as it relates to new lease pricing, new customers moving in. There is some of the COVID unbundling, if you will, that's going on that, as you point out, will start to taper off, if you will, at some point. But the other variables surrounding job growth, migration trends, the inability for people to go out and buy homes at pricing that has gotten above what they can afford and so forth. Those variables are likely to continue for some time as we see. And certainly, overall migration trends, the demand for apartment housing across our region has continued to be very robust. So I think that new lease pricing is probably inflated a little bit right now as a consequence of sort of coming out of COVID. And so to some degree, if you want to think about moderation taking place as we get sort of past the code at influence altogether, it probably does show up a little bit more so in new lease pricing and to put a number to that right now is kind of hard because we don't know which of those variables is necessarily creating the most impact. I would tell you, probably as job growth and migration trends and what's happening to single-family housing more so than any sort of COVID unbundling effect that's going on. No closing remarks. We appreciate everyone joining us and, obviously, follow up with any questions you may have. Thank you."

            "name": "Tom Grimes",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the third quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 15%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis grew 6.3%. This is nearly 5x the 1.3% growth of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96.4%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages. This will bring our total number of smart units up to 47,000 units. We're in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first eight full repositioned properties and have another eight that are underway this year. Leasing activity for October has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for October is running close to 20% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in October is running 13% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16% so far for October. Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 95.9% which is 30 basis points better than October of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 6.8%. This is 10 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We are well positioned as we move into the fourth quarter and '22. I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well, have shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their progress in 2021. Brad? No, Rich. It's -- the sort of popularity has stayed sort of the same with 1s and 2s being most popular and the efficiency is still the least, only 4% exposure to those in their mid-teens on rent growth, and they're above 95% occupied. So, we're there. But I mean, we they really -- we see people staying put. Our renewal conversations though at higher rates than they've ever been or easier because everybody sees the noise in the market and the price of single-family homes and those kind of things, so there has not been a retrenchment. And then on -- as far as affordability goes, we continue to stay in the same area where we've been in that 21%, 22% range. So, our sense is salaries are adjusting and folks are continuing as is. Yes. And Tim has some more detailed data on this. But roughly, from '19 to '20, it's moved probably 150, 200 basis points, but it has not moved material, and it's still incredibly affordable. So, it is a shift or what we're seeing is the people coming in the front door are more qualified. So it may not be the rate. It may not be salaries that are coming up, but the people that we are attracting are easily able to pay for the rent."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The already robust investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint has strengthened. Transaction volume is at a record high as investors are looking to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets. Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand continues to push pricing growth. putting further downward pressure on cap rates. While the main focus of our capital deployment effort is currently on development through our in-house development and our repurchase program with third-party developers, we remain active in the transaction market and are actively evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities. For the moment, new development provides a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital. We believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, we will likely find more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties. Our pre-purchase and development pipeline that includes both under construction and in lease-up projects stands at 2,999 units with a total cost of $710 million. While the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions, we continue to make good progress towards growing the pipeline. Our in-house development team has multiple sites either owned or under contract that we expect to start construction on in 2022. We have three sites in Denver, one of which is a three-phase site, a two-phase site in Raleigh and a site in Tampa. Additionally, we are negotiating on pre-purchase projects in Charlotte and Salt Lake City that we hope to start next year as well. Despite inflationary pressures on materials and labor, we expect stabilized NOI yields on our new projects to remain in the 5.5 to 5.75 range. The strong leasing demand we're seeing across our portfolio is also evident in our lease-up properties, where we're seeing rents and velocity well above our pro forma. Because of this strong demand, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Sand Lake property in Orlando by two quarters with an expected stabilization date of third quarter '22. All of our under-construction projects remain on budget and on schedule with yield expectations at or above our original projections. These projects have fixed cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing increased material shortages due to strong demand and shipping delays. Our construction management team has done a great job in navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact to our schedules. However, we expect these supply chain disruptions could add 60 days or so to any new starts next year. We've made great progress on our remaining dispositions for the year, which includes two properties in Savannah and one in Charlotte. The buyers are through their due diligence processes with hard earnest money deposits so the closing should wrap up fairly soon. Pricing on these 31-year-old assets is very strong, generating a levered investment IRR of 30%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al. Yes, this is Brad. I can give you a little bit of color to that. If we go back to, call it, first quarter of this year, cap rates on new deals in the market that we were underwriting and looking at, cap rates were about 4%. Second quarter, they were at, call it, 3.75%. This quarter, that's down to about 3.25%. And these are really trailing three-month cap rates. So these are trailing cap rates that we're looking at. So you can see in the last quarter, we've seen probably a 50 basis points or so further compression of cap rates versus what we saw in the second quarter. So we continue to see a significant amount of capital looking in our markets, looking for to deploy for reasons I mentioned in my comments. So, we don't see any reason on the horizon right now that that is going to stop. In fact, we are hearing more and more stories from our brokers that we're talking to that cap rates are in the mid- to upper twos in some of the markets, depending on what the growth looks like. So again, as I mentioned last quarter, I think from here, it feels like cap rates probably come down a little bit more. But we have certainly seen, as we get later in the year and as often is the case, we have seen bid sheets lighten up a little bit. Some of that is because we've had a historical amount of volume this year. So folks maybe have met their allocation or maybe there's just a little bit of deal fatigue as we get later in the year. But Nevertheless, the pricing that the winning bidder is willing to pay is -- continues to be aggressive driving those cap rates down. Well, this is Brad. I think it really depends on what your long-term rent growth outlook is certainly putting in one year of 15%, 20% rent growth helps. But what does that look like in years 2 through 10, I think that's really what's going to drive whether your IRRs are coming down or staying flat. I'd say, generally speaking, IRRs are coming down. But to what degree is going to depend on to what degree you believe this outsized rent growth is going to continue, certainly for a couple of years. But outside of that, you've got folks that are dialing in substantial rehab components on assets to help drive those rates up. So I'd say it just depends, but my general comment would be that IRRs are down to some degree. Amanda, I'll add one thing to that. As we -- we're getting to a point, we are seeing select instances where there is some aspect of a transaction that appeals to a seller other than the highest price, whether it be a timing, a year-end close or something of that nature. And as Eric said, as we get into situations where some supply chains causes some delays, we are seeing folks using more pref equity, mezzanine equity, things of that nature. So their capital stack gets a little bit more expensive as those delays occur, which could open up some opportunities for us to take advantage of an opportunity here or there. Yes. This is Brad. First, I'll just start with why those properties. But we go through a process every year where we -- there are obviously multiple departments here that we sit down with and kind of go through what we want to look to sell potentially for next year. That involves looking at properties that have cash flow and CapEx needs that are above what we're looking for in our overall portfolio has generally trend to older properties. We've got some where maybe there's some regulatory issues that we're looking at that we evaluate. We've got properties that are in markets where the rent growth is not really what we want it to be. So we go through that process every year really to identify the opportunities for us to sell for the following year. The other side of that is we're looking at what can we handle in terms of dilution and then what our cash flow needs for the year, our funding needs. So all of that kind of goes into our process, and we're in the process of doing that now for next year. So we'll certainly have more to say about that with our release for next year. But in terms of what we're selling this year, the two in Savannah, the one in Charlotte, we raised our guidance in terms of that. Pricing was quite a bit higher than what we expected, frankly. The way we look at our pricing on these assets is we're looking at a yield our trailing 12-month NOI yield and what we're getting on the proceeds there. And from that basis, we're getting about a 4.2% yield on those. And just for cap rate comparison purposes, just so you can compare across markets that's about a, call it, a 3.25 to 3.5 market cap rate. So very good pricing that we're able to achieve. And just as a reminder, those are 31-year-old assets that we're selling in those markets. And so very, very strong pricing that we're seeing. Yes, that's correct. I mean I would refer to the three primary areas that I've talked about, John. And all of them, the three -- probably the largest expense categories we have or close to it. I'd say I would look at personnel, whereas repair maintenance and taxes, all of those combined, there are probably 2/3 of our expenses mentioned those. And on personnel, obviously, and I'll let Tom give the details, it's just challenging today to keep our workforce to keep all the positions we need, and it's very competitive, and you may have more details on exactly what that will be next year. We haven't really -- we're going through the details now to look at property by property, market by market, the challenges we're seeing. So -- We'll have more to say about that when we put our fourth quarter out. But in all of those categories, you're looking at, call it, a mid-single-digit kind of number likely for 2022, somewhere plus or minus something for all three of those. And behind the mark, meaning that the new lease prices for new move-in customers is $300 more than what we're charging on a renewal lease. And frankly, as long as the demand level stays as high as it is, and we get the tailwinds from the migration trends and what's happening with single-family housing and so on and so forth. We think that, that probably fuels ability to continue to command a higher price, if you will, from a new move-in customer on a new lease. So when that changes and we go back to a scenario where renewal pricing is exceeding on an absolute dollar amount exceeding what we're charging new customers, hard to forecast, but we don't see it happening anytime in the next year or so. It's really -- where you see pressure on Class A is not so much a market function. It's more a supply issue. Whenever you see new supply coming into the market, more often than not, it is going to have a price point associated with the new construction in a location, frankly, oftentimes, that it's going to be a more direct competitor to our existing A-class product, A class portfolio. So to some degree, the performance delta is more a function of supply coming to the market and which part of our portfolio -- a price point of our portfolio is more likely to impact. It varies. In some locations, they do and some they don't. It's hard to give you a widespread. I would tell you that the presence of concessions in the market generally does not exist today versus a year ago. And so broadly, concessions are -- you don't really see that much of the market anywhere at this point."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Brad. The continued very strong pricing trends and high occupancy through the third quarter produced revenue performance well above our prior expectations. Core FFO was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the outperformance essentially all coming from revenue. Rent and lease pricing for the third quarter was 5% higher than projections, supported by an average physical occupancy about 50 basis points above projections. And as we expected, operating expense growth for the quarter moderated given some favorable prior year comparisons, but it is projected to return to the full year range during the fourth quarter. As you saw in the release, this third quarter performance produced a significant increase to both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased projected core FFO for the year to $6.94 per share, which is $0.19 per share above our prior midpoint and now represents a 7.9% growth over the prior year. The increase is driven by revised same-store revenue growth projection for the full year of 5.1% at the midpoint, which is based on continued strong pricing trends through the fourth quarter with some late seasonal moderation expected and we're assuming blended lease pricing averaging somewhere around 10% for full quarter. We left our operating expense expectation for the year unchanged at 4.25% and 4.75% growth which produces revised same-store NOI growth for the year of 5.5% at the midpoint. We do expect some growing pressure from operating expenses as we move into 2022 with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and real estate taxes which combined to make up over 2/3 of operating expenses, all expected to begin showing some inflationary increases during 2022. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We completed several important financing transactions during the third quarter, which further enhanced our strength. We issued a combined $600 million in public bonds during the quarter, a barbell deal pairing 5-year and 30-year notes, which had very good pricing for both, have lended to a 2.1% effective rate, which supports our view that our current ratings are conservative. These transactions also fixed over 99% of our debt and extended our average debt maturities to almost nine years, providing employee protection from a rising interest rate environment. We also executed an 18-month forward equity transaction which provides around $210 million of future funding for our growing development pipeline and based on current projections, this takes care of our equity needs for the next couple of years. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Mallory, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions. I think -- Brad, this is Al. I'll take that in those comments as my comments. I think what we have put into our expectations is continued strong trends. I mean October was a little ahead of the quarter, as you mentioned. And so we're seeing that in October, maybe into November, but we do believe there's going to be some seasonal, call it, holiday moderation even as we get into the last month of the quarter we put that in the forecast. And so that kind of brings us to that 10% average. But I'll say this, but also -- the fourth quarter is the lowest number of leases that we do for any other quarter. And so, even if it's a little higher, a little bit lower, it really won't have that big of an impact on that performance. And so we feel like that was the right range to put in. We definitely put our guidance -- you've seen our update Austin. We expect to average for the year about 96%. So down a little bit from where we have been. But as Tom mentioned, October occupancy was down just a little bit. Nothing -- it's still in the high 95s. We expect something in the high 95%, something like that. But I think as we mentioned, the pricing growth that's the average for the whole quarter. Taking into account the last part of the quarter, which may be some seasonality, even call it, like we said, even holiday traffic really slows down during that period. But as we mentioned, it really shouldn't have that big impact from the quarter, not as much as we would in other quarters because there's just very few leases that are signed. I think I would say on that, Rob, is a combination of growing top line and great revenue growth and declining cap rates, as Brad talks about, has put pressure almost everywhere in our portfolio. There are areas that are more aggressive that we do expect more pressure. We talked often about particularly Texas and Florida. Those two are the most aggressive programs, and they're both combined a little over 50% of our tax liability. So we expect that to be the biggest area in 2022 to really a challenge. Now we'll fight everything as we do. And we'll see what happens. There's some factors that help us a bit in 2022, and then we'll have some areas that aren't assessing. I think Tennessee, North Carolina, they're not reassessing this year, parts of our Georgia portfolio because we've appealed and we've completed those, and there's kind of a lot for one year or two when you've completed appeals. So there some areas that are not going to see assessments that's going to be helpful, but Texas and Florida are going to really challenge us. And so we're preparing for that. And with the growing top line and driving cap rates you expect that we've talked about mid- to upper single-digit kind of expectations in some of those markets. And so that's what -- we'll have more to say about that as we end the year and put out guidance and it's certainly as we move into next year, but that's where the pressure should come from. Yes. And that was really -- that's a good question, Nick. That's really kind of the point I was trying to get across earlier is that those three -- when you take those three largest areas we talked about, that's now we're 2/3 of the expenses and you've got that mid-single digits kind of number, that's certainly reasonable. And we'll have more to say about that as we move -- as we give our guidance, but that is going to be -- those three are going to be big drivers for next year and the pressure that we see on expenses."

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, July 29th, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance of MAA, for opening comments. Please go ahead.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Mallory, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks Tim, and good morning, everyone. MAA had a strong second quarter with rent growth, same-store NOI and core FFO results ahead of expectations, strong job growth and positive migration trends continue to drive higher demand for housing across our Sunbelt markets and we expect continued strong rent growth. As noted in our earnings release, we are adjusting our performance expectations for the year and meaningfully increasing guidance for core FFO performance. The various factors that were driving employers and households to the Sunbelt markets before the impact of COVID continue. In addition, the COVID related recalibrating by both employers and employees about where they choose to do business and live continues to also fuel higher demand trends across the Sunbelt. And those trends are accelerating. The new residents that we moved in year-to-date from outside of our Sunbelt footprint increased another 265 basis points as compared to the first six months of last year, during the peak of COVID related relocations. New move-ins from renters relocating to the Sunbelt currently constitute almost 13% of our new leases so far this year, and are trending higher during the second quarter in a number of markets such as Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville, and Charleston, the percentage of new residents moving to our properties from outside the Sunbelt was even higher.\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We saw a strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing during the quarter was up 8.2%. As a result all in place rents on a year-over-year basis grew to 3.1%. This is more than double the 1.3% growth rate of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary driver and what the current blended pricing momentum we expected to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter increased to 96.4%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress on our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat, and security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and install 22,000 Smart Home packages. We\u2019re also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first eight full reposition properties and have another eight that will begin this year. We\u2019ve seen activity for July has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for July is running close to 17% ahead of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July was running 9% ahead of the prior lease. As a result blended pricing for the portfolio is up 12% so far in July.\nBrad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The strong investor demand for multi-family properties in our footprint that began prior to COVID continues to strengthen today. Transaction volume is up significantly since the first quarter as investors look to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt market. Strong leasing fundamentals coupled with robust investor demand have accelerated pricing growth, putting additional downward pressure on cap rates. Cap rates on deals we underwrote in the second quarter have compressed another 25 basis points from first quarter and the compression has accelerated in the last 30 days pushing cap rates down approximately 100 basis points since first quarter of 2020. We liked the overall balance and unique diversification of our Sunbelt oriented portfolio and have no need to change our market weightings by participating in the aggressive pricing market for existing properties. Therefore we will continue to focus our capital deployment efforts on new development and pre-purchase opportunities, which provide higher yields, higher growth and a much lower basis than the acquisition opportunities we\u2019re seeing in the current market. We continue to make progress on our development pipeline as noted in our release, we closed and started construction on two pre-purchase projects in the second quarter, bringing our pre-purchase and development pipeline both under construction and in-lease up to 3,347 units at a total cost of $775 million. In addition to these two projects, we have a number of other development sites owned or under contract and hope to start construction on several projects later this year and into 2022. Our pre-development opportunities are in Denver, Salt Lake City, Tampa, Raleigh, and Nashville, all existing markets within our portfolio footprint. We continue to see very strong leasing demand in our region of the country and are recently completed properties in Dallas and Phoenix that are currently in lease up, reflect this strong demand.\nAl Campbell: Thank you, Brad. The strong second quarter operating performance produced core FFO that was at the top end of our prior guidance range, $0.08 per share above the midpoint, which also supports improved performance expectations over the remainder of the year. As you saw on our release, we are significantly increasing our guidance for both core FFO and same-store performance for the full year. The increases are primarily based on projections of continued high occupancy levels remaining, essentially full between 95.5% and 96% over the remainder of the year and continued strong rental pricing growth over the second half, particularly during the third quarter with some typical seasonal moderation expected in the fourth quarter. That supports revised revenue growth projection for the full year of 4% at the midpoint of guidance, which is 200 basis points above the prior midpoint. Same-store operating expenses have largely been in line with our expectations for the year. As outlined early in the year, we expected expenses to be somewhat elevated during the first half mainly related to the impact of our double play program. The difficult prior your insurance renewal, as well as some continued pressure on real estate taxes, which would represent about 40% of our total operating costs overall.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.  We\u2019ll take our first question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thanks, good morning, everyone. In terms of the new guidance on blended lease growth that you have for the year, I guess, it\u2019s implying some strengthening here, which you\u2019ve seen in July and I assume for the rest of the third quarter, it\u2019s assumed. Can you just maybe just give us a feel for how that\u2019s going to look in the back half of the year? And as well, if those numbers are still very high sort of single-digit, double-digit numbers, what does that mean in terms of the benefit that you\u2019re starting to get for the lease role, as we\u2019re thinking about next year\u2019s results?\nAl Campbell: Hi, Nick, this is Al. I can start with that and maybe Tim and I can join on some of those details. So, I think, obviously, as you saw in the second quarter we had tremendous trend coming from the first quarter. Our average pricing, our blended pricing was 2.7% for the first quarter, 8.2% in the second quarter. And so as you look at the back half and you take the guidance that we put out 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, while obviously assuming continued strength in that. And as I mentioned a bit in my calls, primarily in the third quarter because July, we\u2019ve seen and it\u2019s already very strong, we expect that to continue. We do expect some normal seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter, but still have the strong numbers, but that blends down. So you can do the math on that. You\u2019re around, somewhere around 8% for the back half of the year when you did the math of our new guidance. And so, that\u2019s with \u2013 obviously with continued strong and stable occupancy that we talked about those are under guidance there.\nTim Argo: Yes. I\u2019ll add to that Nick, to kind of answer your second question about sort of what the baked in is the way we think about that as you take sort of a half of pricing in one year and half of the pricing in the next year. It should sort of average out to the full year effective rent growth. So to Al\u2019s point about our 7% blended lease-over-lease for the year, about half of that we expect to blend into 2022s and certainly setting up some good strength for next year.\nNick Yulico: Okay, great, thanks so much. Second question is just on, if we look at some markets that are \u2013 if we look at some of the industry data coming out on markets such as Atlanta, Tampa, Phoenix right, which you also highlighted as being very strong markets. And I think you also said that the migration into some of those markets from without outside the Sunbelt is higher than other parts of the portfolio, but which may be a factor in this question but I guess, what I\u2019m wondering is when we look at the data, it feels like those markets right now if you blend what\u2019s going on with rent growth this year and last year is actually looking better than pre-COVID. And maybe that migration is a benefit or there are other factors, but just wanted to hear your thoughts on some of these really high rent growth markets, which are not \u2013 they didn\u2019t have concessions, so this is pure rent growth you\u2019re seeing. It looks stronger than 2019. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you think is driving that excess rent growth now versus pre-COVID.\nTim Argo: Yes, Nick. I mean, it is economy first. We\u2019ve seen those never let up the gas on the growth. And so that\u2019s continued to roll on in those larger markets. And then secondarily, these move-ins from out-of-market has grown over COVID levels and over prior year, even someone like Phoenix 21% of our move-outs were out-of-market, Tampa 18% out-of-market, Nashville 15% out-of-market and Savannah 16%. Those are substantially higher than we saw even last year, which we believe it sort of accelerated the trend. So it is those items and you\u2019re seeing folks follow jobs announcements from places like Oracle and Tesla and Microsoft and places like that.\nEric Bolton: And Nick, this is Eric. A statistic that I\u2019ll share with you that Tim and some others pull together that I think is pretty telling. If you look at the MAA markets collectively, we have about 28% of the households in America live in our markets, 28%. But you look at where new household formation is occurring, our markets constitute 42% of projected new household formations and that 42% is expected to grow to 44% next year. So, there\u2019s a lot of factors that come into why the household formation trends are so much more robust in the Sunbelt, a lot of them, but I think that the trends that were there before COVID are still there and then I think COVID is sort of cause, as I mentioned, companies and employers and households to sort of recalibrate their thinking a little bit about where they choose to live. And I think that has just added more fuel to the demand curve.\nNick Yulico: All right, thanks Eric and everyone else.\nEric Bolton: Thank you, Nick.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.\nNeil Malkin: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nEric Bolton: Hi, Neil.\nNeil Malkin: Great quarter, I\u2019m just clapping you over here for the just amazing results, just continue to blow my mind. In your first IRT and Steadfast merger that portfolio seems to be a little bit under the radar, but pretty sizable mostly markets that overlap nicely with your portfolio, some B quality stuff in there, so opportunity to do some highly accretive redevelopment. I am just wondering if you look at that deal and if there any others like it out there and your thoughts on M&A using your stock price given it\u2019s very attractive currency at this point in the cycle and given the strength that you probably expect for the Sunbelt market for quite some time.\nEric Bolton: Hi, Neil, it\u2019s Eric. We are somewhat familiar with that portfolio given the \u2013 as you mentioned, the large overlap with a number of our markets. But candidly, this is \u2013 that is not something that we looked at and it\u2019s not something that we would have looked at simply because I really saw or didn\u2019t see meaningful strategic value in trying to pursue that. The only new markets for us would have been in Indiana, Oklahoma and their small exposure in Chicago. And frankly, those are not markets we\u2019re really interested in pursuing. In addition, the in-place financing on the portfolio was not really good fit with where we\u2019re \u2013 our balance sheet strategy and where we\u2019re working at the balance sheet position to. So absent a strategic, a solid strategic rationale or some form of an assessment that a big opportunity really makes us stronger in some way, just getting a little size is not something we\u2019re really interested in trying to do. We\u2019re looking to strengthen the platform. We\u2019re looking to make ourselves better, if we do something strategic, not just get a little bit bigger. And certainly, absent some sort of a strategic compelling reason to do it, waiting into this super competitive acquisition market and paying top dollar in this environment is frankly and just something we weren\u2019t interested in doing.\nNeil Malkin: Yes. Thank you. Appreciate your comments there. Other one for me is you looked at especially this quarter EQR AVB the sort of coastal bellwether have both made pretty candid comments about the regulatory challenging less attractive, coastal markets California, New York, et cetera. And have started to use your word wait into your markets, your backyard. And obviously, that\u2019s a positive in terms of confirming your thesis on your market, but what do you think the biggest, I guess, threats or risks and then potential opportunities could be now that some of the big boy well-capitalized REITs are starting to sniff around your territory?\nEric Bolton: Well, it\u2019s a big region and a lot of market \u2013 markets across the region, MAA has a fairly in addition to a long, long history focused for the last 27 years on this region and on these markets, we also have I think a very unique approach to how we diversify across the region. And so, we think that the long history we have on the region, the in-depth deep knowledge we have of the markets and the submarkets probably continues to create some level of advantage for us. I think overtime platform capabilities associate with scale and revenue management, cost of capital and market knowledge to support both operations and also to support a disciplined new growth can drive competitive advantages and long-term outperformance. And as I say, with the 27-year history focused on this region, I continue to like our chances.\nNeil Malkin: Yes, okay, I appreciate that. Thank you guys and just tremendous quarter.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Neil.\nAl Campbell: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your guidance for blended lease growth for the year. It actually seems conservative at 7% just given what you printed in the second quarter and then 16% July so far. On top of that, Tom, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that new lease pricing will peak seasonally greater than normal. Can you elaborate on that comments? And then also if you really anticipate the lease growth has slowed significantly from what you have so far in July.\nEric Bolton: Let me start with that, John, and maybe Tim and Tom can jump in on some of that too. In terms of what we have our guidance \u2013 if you look at what we\u2019re projecting for the back half of the year, I mean, we projected a strong performance. We\u2019re taking the third quarter as we talked about we continue \u2013 that \u2013 expect that to continue sort of July strengths into that, but we do expect some modest \u2013 seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s normal. I mean, we \u2013 typically that happens. And so, I\u2019ll say this, we\u2019re still projecting the fourth quarter, that\u2019s well above probably anything we\u2019ve recently done in recent history for sure. So it\u2019s strong, but we will have \u2013 there is just less demand in that period and good thing is that we\u2019ve designed it, so there is less leases being signed as well. So it has less of an impact as well, but we do expect some. So just to give you a flavor, you can do the math what we\u2019re talking about, but you\u2019re talking more like 10% or more expectations in third quarter moderating down to six or so in the forecast, still very strong projection leading to the full year blend that we\u2019re talking about. So it\u2019s very good to see these trends, but we \u2013 reflect what we really think is going to happen over the full year in that.\nTom Grimes: One point of clarification, John, the July is 12% on blended, I think you might have said 16% or 17%. The new lease was that, but the blended was 12%. So we\u2019re expecting sort of August to be pretty similar to that and then start to trend down as demand typically starts to wane a bit.\nEric Bolton: John, one quick way to think about it is blended accommodation both new and renewal pricing year-to-date through the first half of the year was 6%. The forecast assumes that blended performance of the back half of the year even with seasonal factors is 8%. So it\u2019s still positive and good. And we think it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re definitely reasonable to work off that kind of assumption.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Thank you. And then for the guidance we have seen for expenses, it went up for the year. A lot of that is due to higher repairs and maintenance. Are you accelerating any of these costs just given the strength in the market or you do anything different as far as expensing versus capitalizing certain items?\nTom Grimes: No.\nEric Bolton: No changes in expenses and capitalizing. We would expect repair and maintenance costs to come down in the back half of the year just because of the odd comparisons this year. We have some inflationary pressure on some specific items in that, but that\u2019s in Tim and Al\u2019s guidance for the year.\nAl Campbell: There are two things in that, of course, it\u2019s a pretty modest increase in the range overall of 50 basis points, John. But there\u2019s really two things in that, one is, property level performance awards for this strong performance that we\u2019re seeing expected for the year. And we\u2019re very glad to see it and proud of our teams for producing that. So the new some of that\u2026\nTom Grimes: That\u2019s the bulk of it.\nAl Campbell: That\u2019s probably the bulk of it. And then you have some inflationary pressures on impairment supplies and things that we did, which is typical across, I\u2019d say, everybody right now with full market, but pretty smaller growth.\nJohn Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Hey, everyone, thanks. Since we\u2019re on the topic of guidance, can you just talk through the 3Q guide a little bit. Obviously, in the second quarter you have the $169 for core FFO and then the mid-point of the third quarter range is $168. So is there some sort of offsetting factor to this strong blended rate growth that you are seeing?\nAl Campbell: I think if you look historically, over the last several years, in terms of core FFO, third quarter is usually sort of the low point and it\u2019s really just with all of the activity going on in third quarter, we have \u2013 the expenses are at their highest point, obviously getting the highest rents as well. But the seasonality of expenses usually drives and I think honestly, like I said, I think if you look at the last several years Q3 is probably our low point in terms of core FFO, nothing structural driving that other than the normal outage.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then going back to the first question on the call, this double-digit strength we\u2019re seeing in a lot of your markets. How long do you think that goes on more broadly? I mean, is demand just so strong that it won\u2019t taper until you see either demand fall-off or supply pick up or is there sort of just a kind of one-timer pricing of the rent levels that these markets can bear?\nEric Bolton: Well, I mean fundamentally, it comes down to just supply-demand sort of balance and we certainly continue to see evidence that the demand level is going to remain strong other than sort of normal seasonal patterns that we\u2019ve alluded to. It\u2019s hard for me to point to any sort of definitive reason as to why the demand side of the equation is likely to show any significant moderation. I think that if you want to think about some level of catch-up occurring, if you will, as a consequence of what went on last year, we went back and took a look at what we expected to occur last year in the second quarter, in our pricing before we knew about COVID. And obviously last year during COVID, we came in short of those original expectations to the tune of about 250 basis points in terms of blended lease-over-lease pricing. So if one wants to think about this year\u2019s performance has somewhat of an extra juice to it, as a consequence to recover from last year, from a lease-over-lease perspective. I would argue that probably no more than 200 basis points, 250 basis points of that is a function of recovery from last year overwhelmingly what\u2019s driving, it is just all the factors that are driving the really strong demand side of the business. In terms of employers and employees finding reasons to come to the region and then new jobs is continuing to form here. And as I pointed out a moment ago with our markets constituting collectively 42% of the household formation \u2013 projected household formations in 2021 and that\u2019s growing to 44% based on the information, we get from economy.com. And some of these other services, it suggests to us that the demand side of the equation is likely to remain pretty robust. And we do think that it\u2019s unlikely for all the reasons Brad alluded to surrounding what\u2019s going on with construction costs, land sites and things of that nature. We think that we probably see supply levels remain fairly elevated like, they are now going into next year. But it\u2019s hard for me to envision supply levels picking-up materially from where they are. So as we sit here today I think we\u2019re pretty optimistic that we\u2019re going to see pretty good favorable demand-supply relationship for us going into next year.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Joseph, Citibank.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. You guys talked about the competition for assets and all the new entrants into the market. Are you seeing the similar level of competition for developments in pre-sale? Or is it a little different than stabilized properties?\nBrad Hill: Nick, this is Brad. I mean, I would say that it certainly aggressive. There is certainly a lot of equity that\u2019s looking to put money out in development. I would say, it\u2019s a little less. I think the demand for immediate earning assets is a bit higher than the demand for assets that are not going to produce for three years. So it certainly aggressive out there with a lot of capital, but I would say it is less in the development arena and in the JV arena than it is in the acquisition market.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then you talked about the population movement a lot with people entering the market, but when you look at the move out and obviously turn over still low, are you seeing people leave the markets or any changes or reason to move out with the data that you collect?\nBrad Hill: No. We\u2019re seeing a little bit higher move outs, slightly higher on home buying and but primarily job transfer, which is kind of what you would expect especially comparing to last year, when there was less of that kind of movement. And then 4% of our move out sort to outer area and that\u2019s down from 5%. So sort of once people move here, they tend to stay in the area and job transfers and home buying generate the change.\nNick Joseph: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Kalmus, Zelman Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking the question. When you look at their move-ins this quarter and the demographics of the move-ins, are they similar to your current portfolio and do they vary from the out-of-state movers versus within the same markets.\nAl Campbell: Though, when we look at it, one thing that is interesting, that is occurring Alex is you would think with the large run-up in pricing opportunity for us that that would stress on affordability. But we\u2019re seeing affordability, staying at 19% to 20% range or the rent to income ratio I should say in that 19% to 20% range. So the incomes are \u2013 that are coming in are higher and that is \u2013 that\u2019s gives us plenty of room to run in that area.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much. And moving to the Smart Home tech side, you\u2019ve talked in the past about the A/B testing and potentially gain some top line views from including the Smart Home technology. Have you updated that analysis? And are you still seeing the same sort of top line benefits there?\nAl Campbell: Yes, we\u2019re getting a very solid $20 to $25 bump in that. And then what we\u2019ll begin to see as well, we really underwrote on the thing that we knew we would get or we felt strongly about was the revenue opportunity. We\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of our mobile maintenance plan, which was we just installed mobile maintenance or upgraded mobile maintenance for the portfolio in the second quarter. Then that will begin to create some efficiency for us on the expense side, on leak detection, as well as just saving time between units responding to calls real time those kind of things.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAl Campbell: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. Line is open.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Thanks. Good morning. You\u2019ve gotten plenty of questions on guidance, but I did want to ask about your occupancy outlet that\u2019s embedded for the full year. It sounds like you may have seen a slight increase in turnover more recently, given a sequential occupancy decline in July, how are you thinking about balancing rated occupancy for the remainder of the year? And do you think you\u2019ve reached the structurally high level of occupancy for your portfolio in the second quarter?\nEric Bolton: Yes. Amanda, I\u2019ll start with that and then Tom, you can. The way we look at it is we\u2019ve talked about in the past. Around the 96 point level, which we\u2019re talking about to the back half of the year, high-95 to mid-96 range we\u2019re projecting. That\u2019s essentially full given our turnover and the way things are right now in our portfolio. So we\u2019re projecting to be stable at that very strong, but give ourselves in the back half, a little bit of room to continue pushing on price. We certainly didn\u2019t want to expect occupancy to continue growing from where it is, because we like to continue putting these good prices in the portfolio. So that\u2019s what\u2019s underlying our expectations and our forecasting I mean.\nTom Grimes: Yes. And Amanda on balancing pricing occupancy, I think we\u2019ve always believed that when there is an opportunity to build strength in embedded rent growth that we should take that. And that is something that we did before the pandemic, we will really push that and that gave us higher ERU or effective rent growth for all in place ahead of the downturn, which allowed us to weather the storm and again we\u2019re in an opportunity where we can push rate and that is I would say primary. And honestly, I\u2019d be happy from 95.5% to 96.5% and I\u2019ll think \u2013 we were a little higher in second quarter even with the rent increase then frankly, we wanted to be. But given where current occupancy is and more importantly where exposure is, I would sort of expect us to stay in that 96.1% and above range for the next couple of months. But, I mean, we are building strength now and the opportunity to really help our future is to grow rate, right now and we\u2019re having that way.\nEric Bolton: Amanda, this is Eric, one final point final point I\u2019ll make on that. I mean, we do monitor very closely the percentage of our turnover that\u2019s occurring because of the rent increase and we track that. And in the second quarter, the move-outs that we had due to the rent increase were about 7% of our move-outs. And you compare and contrast that to 2019, a more normalized year and move-outs due to rent increase range anywhere from 7% to 10%. So we\u2019ve monitored pretty closely. If we saw move-outs jump up a lot because of rent increase and we would start to taper back a little bit. But at this point, no real change occurring.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That\u2019s helpful. Certainly, a good problem to have. And then on development, how are you thinking about staging the construction starts for those pre-development projects you\u2019ve discussed? And then as you think about adding additional projects to that pre-development pipeline, are you still finding the best opportunities and some of those longer-term repurposing and permitting opportunities that you\u2019ve talked about?\nBrad Hill: Well this is Brad. Amanda, certainly in terms of the staging, the developments that we\u2019re working on now we\u2019ve got a pipeline right now of about $800 million or so that we\u2019re really working through both owned sites and then sites under contract and they were working on pre-development on and then also our pre-purchase platform. So, those take given where we are in the cycle and given how hard it is to get find sites and get sites entitled. The staging of those you can\u2019t perfectly map those out, frankly. And a lot of the developments that we\u2019re doing in-house are for sites that need to be rezoned. So it takes some time to get through that process. But frankly, really what we\u2019re doing on those is, is working through the pre-development process in our approvals. And then really once we get to a point where we can have a GMP and known construction prices locked in, that\u2019s acceptable to us, we look to move forward with those opportunities. I would say, the pre-purchase timeline is a bit more truncated, because again, we\u2019re putting off some of the risk associated with the pre-development work to the developers that we\u2019re partnering with. So those have a little bit shorter time period on them, sometimes, not all the time. So we\u2019re able to work those in kind of power starts a little quicker than stuff that we\u2019re doing in-house. So a long way of saying, we can\u2019t really perfectly map that out. It\u2019s really once we get costs and approvals, and everything behind us on those projects. And then what was the second part of your question, Amanda?\nAmanda Sweitzer: Just in terms of future opportunities to add to your pre-development pipeline are you still finding some of the best opportunities in those longer-term repurposing or permitting opportunities that you\u2019ve talked about in the past?\nBrad Hill: Yes, I mean we certainly have opportunities there. I think I mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019ve got about $800 million that we think we can repopulate here and that\u2019s a mixture of stuff that is on balance sheet and then also our pre-purchase \u2013 the sites that our development team are working on now. Sometimes are 1.5 years to get through the development process. So, it\u2019s taking a little bit of time to do that on some of them. But, those are great opportunities. But I will say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find sites, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to get sites zoned and permitted and really work through that process. So those are taking a bit longer, but we feel really good about the pipeline that we have and then the ability to repopulate that as we go forward.\nEric Bolton: And Amanda, this is Eric. I would add that we do think that we see the competition for opportunities that involve rezoning or that involve a much longer process. The competition for those sites is not quite as fierce as what you find in something that is shovel ready if you will and ready to go. That\u2019s what caused a lot of the \u2013 particularly among the smaller developers and among the some of the private capital coming to the market. They have a mandate that doesn\u2019t allow them to take quite that much time often. And so we do find better opportunities more often than not in more, those projects that require a little bit more time.\nAmanda Sweitzer: That\u2019s helpful, thanks for the time.\nEric Bolton: Yes. Thanks, Amanda.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Just curious if you mark-to-market and trend out rents on your existing development pipeline, what the difference or upside between the yield that you underwrote, and what that might suggest? And do you think that the projects could stabilize ahead of the timeline that you\u2019ve outlined in the release?\nBrad Hill: Austin, this is Brad. I would say broadly again we\u2019re seeing strength as I mentioned in my comments in our lease-ups and we\u2019re seeing that both in velocity and we\u2019re seeing that also in rate. So I would say, if we trended that out, we\u2019re going to see some good positive momentum in the yields that we have there. Certainly for the two that we have in lease up right now, that\u2019s the case. The other ones that are under construction where pre-leasing is kind of just starting, it\u2019s a little too early to say on those, but we\u2019re certainly seeing really, really good momentum as we go forward there. And in terms of the velocity, we did move up the expected stabilization date of our novel midtown deal in Phoenix by two quarters that again that market is doing extremely strong in the lease up is going very, very well and ahead of expectations, so we have moved that data.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Not to put you on the spot, I mean, could you quantify what the yield you think, the yield outside? And I think you\u2019ve said 6% it is sort of the average yield across the pipeline. I mean you think is it 50 basis points or something less in any sense putting a range?\nBrad Hill: No, I wouldn\u2019t say 50 basis points. But I would say it\u2019s call it 20 basis points at this point. But again, as we get into the novel mid-town deals, 46% occupied and it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s too early to put numbers on that, but broadly, I would say, it\u2019s 20 plus basis points.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then as far as redevelopment. I think the average increase was around 11%, but clearly the new lease rates you\u2019re achieving across the portfolio are even higher. What do you think the premium is you\u2019re getting on redevelopment today?\nBrad Hill: I think the premiums right at 11%, honestly, because the way we really should try to understand what the market will pay for the premium and match that and then let the market rate push us up from there. So our redevelopment unit may be getting $200 more, $100 of that is redevelopment premium and $100 of it is market growth.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it, got it. Then one last quick one for me. What\u2019s the loss to lease today on the portfolio?\nTim Argo: So Austin, if you think about that in a lot of different ways, and talking to Nick earlier, one of the way we really think about that, it can be very seasonal depending on what time of the year you\u2019re looking at. But, I think we\u2019re expecting 7% blended lease over lease for this year. So that obviously half of that or so trades in the in the next year. So certainly the good spot and I would \u2013 it\u2019ll depend on kind of where the full year lease-over-lease.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks guys.\nEric Bolton: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Your line is open.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Tom, can you talk a little bit about the markets, first half versus second half and which ones you expect to see the strongest incremental growth for the first half of the year, the second half of the year and then which ones, because either they\u2019ve had such a big pop already, are going to wind-up seeing the least sort of incremental growth as you move forward here?\nAl Campbell: Yes. I mean that\u2019s a relative question, Rob, because at this point in July, our leasing growth, I\u2019ve got six markets below 10% blended rent growth and the slower of those are DC and Houston, which are I think 5.2% and 5.7% for blended rent growth but that\u2019s encouraging progress for those. So I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 I don\u2019t see any market where it\u2019s slowing to be honest with you. In terms of the market, again we\u2019ll have seasonal trends as you\u2019re well aware of but places like Phoenix and Tampa continue to accelerate in places like Atlanta and Austin have really picked it up recently and we\u2019re seeing that on into Dallas and across the portfolio. I mean the number of markets and the majority of our markets are \u2013 a large majority of our markets are now pushing higher than 10% blended rent growth. So I don\u2019t see any sort of tipping point that\u2019s been reached other than seasonality. And of course, Eric made the point earlier of we\u2019re pushing through stout renewal increases and we\u2019re getting less pushback than we have historically.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al, once the \u2013 when did or when does the insurance renew? And did you get hit with any type of major increase on the last renewal just simply because of higher construction costs on replacing units or  et cetera?\nTom Grimes: We did our renewal effective July 1 and it was roughly we called 14%, 15% year-over-year, which is right in-line with what we\u2019re expecting. We didn\u2019t see anything necessarily driven specifically by development costs. Frankly, the winter storm Uri is really what drove it more than anything. I think we would have had a lower without that. But we feel like we\u2019re in a good position now and taking the appropriate amount of risk on balance sheet and expect to see that continue to decline going forward.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then one last one. Given your markets, how many units do you have that you would have vicked if you could, but are legally prevented from doing so? And then how many units overall in the portfolio are currently in the eviction process?\nTim Argo: Rob, I\u2019d say on that it\u2019s very limited, and you can see that with our collections of 99.2% right now for the second quarter. It\u2019s been strong, I don\u2019t expect the change in rules on evictions to change anything much and we\u2019re working closely with relief fund folks to manage that process. So, honestly I don\u2019t see that it makes a big difference going-forward.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Anderson, SMBC. Your line is open.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So the ultimate sign of fundamental strength, not that we need a hint is when new lease growth is greater than renewal lease rents. And so, I\u2019m curious if in the past when that condition has existed with MAA, how long does it last? And is there anything strategically you\u2019re doing for an incoming new resident that is perhaps driving that level of growth relative to renewals.\nTom Grimes: Rich, what I\u2019ll say is, it is also a sign that we have opportunity on renewal. And I\u2019ll tell you the renewal pricing that was achieved in the second quarter was really priced in the first quarter and vice versa. So, I think you\u2019ll see that delta begin to narrow as we re-price going out. July was higher than the second quarter and we\u2019ll see that continue to grow a bit. But \u2013 and the new lease rate really frankly gives us a good cover to begin to move that out up. And again as Eric mentioned, we have a low push back on renewal accept rates, because they can get out and see the housing market pricings very transparent and they know they\u2019ve got a good deal right now.\nBrad Hill: Rich, in addition to what Tom alludes to, in terms of the gap closing just as a natural consequence of us repricing on renewals faster, I mean there\u2019s a timing difference between how we price new leases versus how we price renewals, which you alluded to. But in addition to that, I mean, what \u2013 frankly, what defines how long the opportunity continues is a function of just basic sort of demand-supply characteristics. And as I\u2019ve alluded to, we \u2013 as we sit here today, we don\u2019t see anything near term over the next year. So that\u2019s likely to disrupt kind of the strong environment that we find ourselves in. So we think that we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to keep pushing hard today on the pricing increases for new move ins. And today, we are pricing renewals for what we will achieve 60, 90 days from now. And when we get 60, 90 days from now, we will be pricing those renewals at a steeper rate. So it\u2019s sort of \u2013 as you say, it\u2019s an indication of real strong fundamentals and we don\u2019t see anything near-term that is likely to disrupt that.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then when you mentioned early on the 13% new leasing is coming from outside the Sunbelt and you gave some examples of some markets that are above that. What was that percentage kind of 2019? What would it be typically? I\u2019m curious, how much it\u2019s grown to that 13% level?\nBrad Hill: I\u2019ll give you an example of it. In Atlanta, as an example, 12% of our move-ins came from outside the Sunbelt, and in 2019, that was a little over 8% in a market like Phoenix, which is incredibly strong in terms of move in some outside the Sunbelt. That was over 21% and so far this year and compared to the same period in 2019 that was a little over 18%. So it\u2019s about a 411 basis point jump from 2019 in Phoenix. We\u2019re seeing saw big jump in Tampa from 2019, this is about over 18% today versus 13% in 2019. So 380 basis point improvement. So it varies a bit by market, but it\u2019s pretty go back to 2019 before COVID. It\u2019s up and move-ins from outside the Sunbelt are up and let\u2019s see it looking at our markets here, the only market that I see where it\u2019s actually the move-ins from outside the Sunbelt are actually down is one and that\u2019s Huntsville, Alabama.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Just s real quick last question. A lot of talk about the cadence between suburbs and urban coastal versus Sunbelt, all those types of geographical dynamics. Do you see within your portfolio any particular strengths, where the population is kind of denser? Do you have better performance there versus a more rural looking area? Or is it just the whole place is great?\nBrad Hill: I mean, broadly the whole place is good, Rich, but the delta between urban, suburban and inner loop and A, B was wider during COVID, both have narrowed. So A&B assets the difference between the two is only a 130 basis points but it\u2019s 7.4% for our lagging A and 8.7% for our leading B. I mean those are both numbers I\u2019m happy to have. And then the same real story, it\u2019s almost the same for sort of urban inner loop versus the suburban assets, it 7.5% and 8.7%. So there is \u2013 both are strong and there\u2019s just a little bit more of a supply headwind in the urban markets, but we don\u2019t see them as less desirable.\nRich Anderson: Got it, thanks very much.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pawlowski, Green. Your line is open.\nJohn Pawlowski: Great. Thanks so much. Brad, would you mind sharing the cap rate on the Jackson, Mississippi exit and the anticipated pricing on the handful of upcoming dispositions.\nBrad Hill: Yes. So we look at this a couple of ways. One is as a cap rate on MAA\u2019s trailing 12 numbers that was about a 5.4, but looked at on a \u2013 from a buyer\u2019s perspective with kind of adjusted taxes and insurance, it was about a 4.7 cap rate. Going forward on the three that we\u2019re looking to sell those \u2013 both of the metrics are very similar because there\u2019s not a big re-evaluation of taxes on those, but we\u2019re looking in the call it 4.5 or 7.5 range. And John, just to keep in mind, that 4.7 cap rate on the exit from Jackson Mississippi, that\u2019s on 36-year old assets. So average age of that portfolio is 36 years old in Jackson, Mississippi.\nJohn Pawlowski: Understood. And, Brad, upcoming dispositions, what markets are there?\nBrad Hill: So we have two in Savannah and one that is in Charlotte.\nJohn Pawlowski: Great. Last one for me, Tom. Single-family rental build to rent communities are the deliveries are probably accelerate pretty meaningfully in the early vintages do have smaller floor plans, a little bit more like apartments. So curious any case studies you\u2019re seeing when a build to rent community opens nearby, any impact on leasing, any statistics or any color you could share will be of interest.\nTom Grimes: No it\u2019s pretty limited. And there, while that is a booming space, it is a relatively small space, but a place we\u2019ve probably seen the most that sort of thing happened and it\u2019s in Phoenix and it certainly hadn\u2019t slowed our momentum there. And just as a reminder and it\u2019s 5% of our move out sort of single-family rental, which is really dwarfed by the job transfer number it is, not a driving factor and we love it that they are raising their rents as well. I mean, it\u2019s been steady where they\u2019ve been.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thanks for the time.\nTom Grimes: Thank you, John.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nBuck Horne: Hey, thanks, good morning. Just \u2013 yes, thank you. Real quickly. Any thoughts or potential impact from eviction, moratorium, roll-off in your portfolio and/or how are you working with residents right now? It\u2019s potentially recover, any rental assistance payments through the government program.\nEric Bolton: Buck, this is Eric. And no, we don\u2019t really see much change coming as a consequence of the expiration of that CDC moratorium. Frankly, it\u2019s not in our portfolio, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of that activity. And I think that as we touched on ever since this started last spring, I mean we have been very active in reaching out to our residents and offering assistance in various ways with over 8,000 of our residents that we\u2019ve assisted. And we continue those efforts and we are also very active and doing all we can to assist our residents with making application that needed for a financial assistance, we\u2019re very aggressive and active and showing them where to go, we are \u2013 where we can, we\u2019re actually doing it for them and making application on their behalf. But it\u2019s not a big percentage of the portfolio, but we don\u2019t really see any near-term change occurring just as a consequence of getting into August and the CDC moratorium no longer being in place.\nBuck Horne: Great, thanks. And just following up on the single-family rental question there. Just may be a different tack on it. A lot of builders are out there and a lot of capital is out there building out entire communities and running them effectively like horizontal apartments. Any evolution in your thought process about maybe a partnership or strategic partnership with a home builder or someone else to invest in a single-family rental community.\nEric Bolton: Well, it\u2019s something we kick around from time to time, Buck. I mean we have a number of our communities, where we actually do have adjacent town homes and housing structures if you will that are not traditional apartment type and design. And if we were to find an opportunity to do something, where you\u2019ve got a purpose-built single-family community in the contiguous area with common amenities and all that kind of stuff, yes, I mean something that we would invest in. We\u2019re not actively looking to make that happen at the moment. We think, we were able to capture a lot of good growth right now with what we\u2019re doing with all the projects that Brad has alluded to. But we\u2019ve got, if you will, a little bit of that in the portfolio already. And it\u2019s something that \u2013 if we find opportunities in that regard to look at, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to look at it.\nBuck Horne: Thanks, guys.\nEric Bolton: Thank you, Buck.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Okay, well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning and any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out anytime. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks Tim, and good morning, everyone. MAA had a strong second quarter with rent growth, same-store NOI and core FFO results ahead of expectations, strong job growth and positive migration trends continue to drive higher demand for housing across our Sunbelt markets and we expect continued strong rent growth. As noted in our earnings release, we are adjusting our performance expectations for the year and meaningfully increasing guidance for core FFO performance. The various factors that were driving employers and households to the Sunbelt markets before the impact of COVID continue. In addition, the COVID related recalibrating by both employers and employees about where they choose to do business and live continues to also fuel higher demand trends across the Sunbelt. And those trends are accelerating. The new residents that we moved in year-to-date from outside of our Sunbelt footprint increased another 265 basis points as compared to the first six months of last year, during the peak of COVID related relocations. New move-ins from renters relocating to the Sunbelt currently constitute almost 13% of our new leases so far this year, and are trending higher during the second quarter in a number of markets such as Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville, and Charleston, the percentage of new residents moving to our properties from outside the Sunbelt was even higher. And Nick, this is Eric. A statistic that I'll share with you that Tim and some others pull together that I think is pretty telling. If you look at the MAA markets collectively, we have about 28% of the households in America live in our markets, 28%. But you look at where new household formation is occurring, our markets constitute 42% of projected new household formations and that 42% is expected to grow to 44% next year. So, there's a lot of factors that come into why the household formation trends are so much more robust in the Sunbelt, a lot of them, but I think that the trends that were there before COVID are still there and then I think COVID is sort of cause, as I mentioned, companies and employers and households to sort of recalibrate their thinking a little bit about where they choose to live. And I think that has just added more fuel to the demand curve. Thank you, Nick. Hi, Neil. Hi, Neil, it's Eric. We are somewhat familiar with that portfolio given the \u2013 as you mentioned, the large overlap with a number of our markets. But candidly, this is \u2013 that is not something that we looked at and it's not something that we would have looked at simply because I really saw or didn't see meaningful strategic value in trying to pursue that. The only new markets for us would have been in Indiana, Oklahoma and their small exposure in Chicago. And frankly, those are not markets we're really interested in pursuing. In addition, the in-place financing on the portfolio was not really good fit with where we're \u2013 our balance sheet strategy and where we're working at the balance sheet position to. So absent a strategic, a solid strategic rationale or some form of an assessment that a big opportunity really makes us stronger in some way, just getting a little size is not something we're really interested in trying to do. We're looking to strengthen the platform. We're looking to make ourselves better, if we do something strategic, not just get a little bit bigger. And certainly, absent some sort of a strategic compelling reason to do it, waiting into this super competitive acquisition market and paying top dollar in this environment is frankly and just something we weren't interested in doing. Well, it's a big region and a lot of market \u2013 markets across the region, MAA has a fairly in addition to a long, long history focused for the last 27 years on this region and on these markets, we also have I think a very unique approach to how we diversify across the region. And so, we think that the long history we have on the region, the in-depth deep knowledge we have of the markets and the submarkets probably continues to create some level of advantage for us. I think overtime platform capabilities associate with scale and revenue management, cost of capital and market knowledge to support both operations and also to support a disciplined new growth can drive competitive advantages and long-term outperformance. And as I say, with the 27-year history focused on this region, I continue to like our chances. Thanks, Neil. Let me start with that, John, and maybe Tim and Tom can jump in on some of that too. In terms of what we have our guidance \u2013 if you look at what we're projecting for the back half of the year, I mean, we projected a strong performance. We're taking the third quarter as we talked about we continue \u2013 that \u2013 expect that to continue sort of July strengths into that, but we do expect some modest \u2013 seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter and that's normal. I mean, we \u2013 typically that happens. And so, I'll say this, we're still projecting the fourth quarter, that's well above probably anything we've recently done in recent history for sure. So it's strong, but we will have \u2013 there is just less demand in that period and good thing is that we've designed it, so there is less leases being signed as well. So it has less of an impact as well, but we do expect some. So just to give you a flavor, you can do the math what we're talking about, but you're talking more like 10% or more expectations in third quarter moderating down to six or so in the forecast, still very strong projection leading to the full year blend that we're talking about. So it's very good to see these trends, but we \u2013 reflect what we really think is going to happen over the full year in that. John, one quick way to think about it is blended accommodation both new and renewal pricing year-to-date through the first half of the year was 6%. The forecast assumes that blended performance of the back half of the year even with seasonal factors is 8%. So it's still positive and good. And we think it's \u2013 they're definitely reasonable to work off that kind of assumption. No changes in expenses and capitalizing. We would expect repair and maintenance costs to come down in the back half of the year just because of the odd comparisons this year. We have some inflationary pressure on some specific items in that, but that's in Tim and Al's guidance for the year. Well, I mean fundamentally, it comes down to just supply-demand sort of balance and we certainly continue to see evidence that the demand level is going to remain strong other than sort of normal seasonal patterns that we've alluded to. It's hard for me to point to any sort of definitive reason as to why the demand side of the equation is likely to show any significant moderation. I think that if you want to think about some level of catch-up occurring, if you will, as a consequence of what went on last year, we went back and took a look at what we expected to occur last year in the second quarter, in our pricing before we knew about COVID. And obviously last year during COVID, we came in short of those original expectations to the tune of about 250 basis points in terms of blended lease-over-lease pricing. So if one wants to think about this year's performance has somewhat of an extra juice to it, as a consequence to recover from last year, from a lease-over-lease perspective. I would argue that probably no more than 200 basis points, 250 basis points of that is a function of recovery from last year overwhelmingly what's driving, it is just all the factors that are driving the really strong demand side of the business. In terms of employers and employees finding reasons to come to the region and then new jobs is continuing to form here. And as I pointed out a moment ago with our markets constituting collectively 42% of the household formation \u2013 projected household formations in 2021 and that's growing to 44% based on the information, we get from economy.com. And some of these other services, it suggests to us that the demand side of the equation is likely to remain pretty robust. And we do think that it's unlikely for all the reasons Brad alluded to surrounding what's going on with construction costs, land sites and things of that nature. We think that we probably see supply levels remain fairly elevated like, they are now going into next year. But it's hard for me to envision supply levels picking-up materially from where they are. So as we sit here today I think we're pretty optimistic that we're going to see pretty good favorable demand-supply relationship for us going into next year. Yes. Amanda, I'll start with that and then Tom, you can. The way we look at it is we've talked about in the past. Around the 96 point level, which we're talking about to the back half of the year, high-95 to mid-96 range we're projecting. That's essentially full given our turnover and the way things are right now in our portfolio. So we're projecting to be stable at that very strong, but give ourselves in the back half, a little bit of room to continue pushing on price. We certainly didn't want to expect occupancy to continue growing from where it is, because we like to continue putting these good prices in the portfolio. So that's what's underlying our expectations and our forecasting I mean. Amanda, this is Eric, one final point final point I'll make on that. I mean, we do monitor very closely the percentage of our turnover that's occurring because of the rent increase and we track that. And in the second quarter, the move-outs that we had due to the rent increase were about 7% of our move-outs. And you compare and contrast that to 2019, a more normalized year and move-outs due to rent increase range anywhere from 7% to 10%. So we've monitored pretty closely. If we saw move-outs jump up a lot because of rent increase and we would start to taper back a little bit. But at this point, no real change occurring. And Amanda, this is Eric. I would add that we do think that we see the competition for opportunities that involve rezoning or that involve a much longer process. The competition for those sites is not quite as fierce as what you find in something that is shovel ready if you will and ready to go. That's what caused a lot of the \u2013 particularly among the smaller developers and among the some of the private capital coming to the market. They have a mandate that doesn't allow them to take quite that much time often. And so we do find better opportunities more often than not in more, those projects that require a little bit more time. Yes. Thanks, Amanda. Thank you. Buck, this is Eric. And no, we don't really see much change coming as a consequence of the expiration of that CDC moratorium. Frankly, it's not in our portfolio, we haven't seen a lot of that activity. And I think that as we touched on ever since this started last spring, I mean we have been very active in reaching out to our residents and offering assistance in various ways with over 8,000 of our residents that we've assisted. And we continue those efforts and we are also very active and doing all we can to assist our residents with making application that needed for a financial assistance, we're very aggressive and active and showing them where to go, we are \u2013 where we can, we're actually doing it for them and making application on their behalf. But it's not a big percentage of the portfolio, but we don't really see any near-term change occurring just as a consequence of getting into August and the CDC moratorium no longer being in place. Well, it's something we kick around from time to time, Buck. I mean we have a number of our communities, where we actually do have adjacent town homes and housing structures if you will that are not traditional apartment type and design. And if we were to find an opportunity to do something, where you've got a purpose-built single-family community in the contiguous area with common amenities and all that kind of stuff, yes, I mean something that we would invest in. We're not actively looking to make that happen at the moment. We think, we were able to capture a lot of good growth right now with what we're doing with all the projects that Brad has alluded to. But we've got, if you will, a little bit of that in the portfolio already. And it's something that \u2013 if we find opportunities in that regard to look at, we wouldn't hesitate to look at it. Thank you, Buck. Okay, well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning and any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out anytime. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We saw a strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing during the quarter was up 8.2%. As a result all in place rents on a year-over-year basis grew to 3.1%. This is more than double the 1.3% growth rate of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary driver and what the current blended pricing momentum we expected to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter increased to 96.4%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress on our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat, and security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and install 22,000 Smart Home packages. We're also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first eight full reposition properties and have another eight that will begin this year. We've seen activity for July has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for July is running close to 17% ahead of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July was running 9% ahead of the prior lease. As a result blended pricing for the portfolio is up 12% so far in July. One point of clarification, John, the July is 12% on blended, I think you might have said 16% or 17%. The new lease was that, but the blended was 12%. So we're expecting sort of August to be pretty similar to that and then start to trend down as demand typically starts to wane a bit. No. That's the bulk of it. Yes. And Amanda on balancing pricing occupancy, I think we've always believed that when there is an opportunity to build strength in embedded rent growth that we should take that. And that is something that we did before the pandemic, we will really push that and that gave us higher ERU or effective rent growth for all in place ahead of the downturn, which allowed us to weather the storm and again we're in an opportunity where we can push rate and that is I would say primary. And honestly, I'd be happy from 95.5% to 96.5% and I'll think \u2013 we were a little higher in second quarter even with the rent increase then frankly, we wanted to be. But given where current occupancy is and more importantly where exposure is, I would sort of expect us to stay in that 96.1% and above range for the next couple of months. But, I mean, we are building strength now and the opportunity to really help our future is to grow rate, right now and we're having that way. We did our renewal effective July 1 and it was roughly we called 14%, 15% year-over-year, which is right in-line with what we're expecting. We didn't see anything necessarily driven specifically by development costs. Frankly, the winter storm Uri is really what drove it more than anything. I think we would have had a lower without that. But we feel like we're in a good position now and taking the appropriate amount of risk on balance sheet and expect to see that continue to decline going forward. Rich, what I'll say is, it is also a sign that we have opportunity on renewal. And I'll tell you the renewal pricing that was achieved in the second quarter was really priced in the first quarter and vice versa. So, I think you'll see that delta begin to narrow as we re-price going out. July was higher than the second quarter and we'll see that continue to grow a bit. But \u2013 and the new lease rate really frankly gives us a good cover to begin to move that out up. And again as Eric mentioned, we have a low push back on renewal accept rates, because they can get out and see the housing market pricings very transparent and they know they've got a good deal right now. No it's pretty limited. And there, while that is a booming space, it is a relatively small space, but a place we've probably seen the most that sort of thing happened and it's in Phoenix and it certainly hadn't slowed our momentum there. And just as a reminder and it's 5% of our move out sort of single-family rental, which is really dwarfed by the job transfer number it is, not a driving factor and we love it that they are raising their rents as well. I mean, it's been steady where they've been. Thank you, John."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The strong investor demand for multi-family properties in our footprint that began prior to COVID continues to strengthen today. Transaction volume is up significantly since the first quarter as investors look to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt market. Strong leasing fundamentals coupled with robust investor demand have accelerated pricing growth, putting additional downward pressure on cap rates. Cap rates on deals we underwrote in the second quarter have compressed another 25 basis points from first quarter and the compression has accelerated in the last 30 days pushing cap rates down approximately 100 basis points since first quarter of 2020. We liked the overall balance and unique diversification of our Sunbelt oriented portfolio and have no need to change our market weightings by participating in the aggressive pricing market for existing properties. Therefore we will continue to focus our capital deployment efforts on new development and pre-purchase opportunities, which provide higher yields, higher growth and a much lower basis than the acquisition opportunities we're seeing in the current market. We continue to make progress on our development pipeline as noted in our release, we closed and started construction on two pre-purchase projects in the second quarter, bringing our pre-purchase and development pipeline both under construction and in-lease up to 3,347 units at a total cost of $775 million. In addition to these two projects, we have a number of other development sites owned or under contract and hope to start construction on several projects later this year and into 2022. Our pre-development opportunities are in Denver, Salt Lake City, Tampa, Raleigh, and Nashville, all existing markets within our portfolio footprint. We continue to see very strong leasing demand in our region of the country and are recently completed properties in Dallas and Phoenix that are currently in lease up, reflect this strong demand. Nick, this is Brad. I mean, I would say that it certainly aggressive. There is certainly a lot of equity that's looking to put money out in development. I would say, it's a little less. I think the demand for immediate earning assets is a bit higher than the demand for assets that are not going to produce for three years. So it certainly aggressive out there with a lot of capital, but I would say it is less in the development arena and in the JV arena than it is in the acquisition market. No. We're seeing a little bit higher move outs, slightly higher on home buying and but primarily job transfer, which is kind of what you would expect especially comparing to last year, when there was less of that kind of movement. And then 4% of our move out sort to outer area and that's down from 5%. So sort of once people move here, they tend to stay in the area and job transfers and home buying generate the change. Well this is Brad. Amanda, certainly in terms of the staging, the developments that we're working on now we've got a pipeline right now of about $800 million or so that we're really working through both owned sites and then sites under contract and they were working on pre-development on and then also our pre-purchase platform. So, those take given where we are in the cycle and given how hard it is to get find sites and get sites entitled. The staging of those you can't perfectly map those out, frankly. And a lot of the developments that we're doing in-house are for sites that need to be rezoned. So it takes some time to get through that process. But frankly, really what we're doing on those is, is working through the pre-development process in our approvals. And then really once we get to a point where we can have a GMP and known construction prices locked in, that's acceptable to us, we look to move forward with those opportunities. I would say, the pre-purchase timeline is a bit more truncated, because again, we're putting off some of the risk associated with the pre-development work to the developers that we're partnering with. So those have a little bit shorter time period on them, sometimes, not all the time. So we're able to work those in kind of power starts a little quicker than stuff that we're doing in-house. So a long way of saying, we can't really perfectly map that out. It's really once we get costs and approvals, and everything behind us on those projects. And then what was the second part of your question, Amanda? Yes, I mean we certainly have opportunities there. I think I mentioned a moment ago, we've got about $800 million that we think we can repopulate here and that's a mixture of stuff that is on balance sheet and then also our pre-purchase \u2013 the sites that our development team are working on now. Sometimes are 1.5 years to get through the development process. So, it's taking a little bit of time to do that on some of them. But, those are great opportunities. But I will say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find sites, it's becoming increasingly difficult to get sites zoned and permitted and really work through that process. So those are taking a bit longer, but we feel really good about the pipeline that we have and then the ability to repopulate that as we go forward. Austin, this is Brad. I would say broadly again we're seeing strength as I mentioned in my comments in our lease-ups and we're seeing that both in velocity and we're seeing that also in rate. So I would say, if we trended that out, we're going to see some good positive momentum in the yields that we have there. Certainly for the two that we have in lease up right now, that's the case. The other ones that are under construction where pre-leasing is kind of just starting, it's a little too early to say on those, but we're certainly seeing really, really good momentum as we go forward there. And in terms of the velocity, we did move up the expected stabilization date of our novel midtown deal in Phoenix by two quarters that again that market is doing extremely strong in the lease up is going very, very well and ahead of expectations, so we have moved that data. No, I wouldn't say 50 basis points. But I would say it's call it 20 basis points at this point. But again, as we get into the novel mid-town deals, 46% occupied and it's really \u2013 it's too early to put numbers on that, but broadly, I would say, it's 20 plus basis points. I think the premiums right at 11%, honestly, because the way we really should try to understand what the market will pay for the premium and match that and then let the market rate push us up from there. So our redevelopment unit may be getting $200 more, $100 of that is redevelopment premium and $100 of it is market growth. Rich, in addition to what Tom alludes to, in terms of the gap closing just as a natural consequence of us repricing on renewals faster, I mean there's a timing difference between how we price new leases versus how we price renewals, which you alluded to. But in addition to that, I mean, what \u2013 frankly, what defines how long the opportunity continues is a function of just basic sort of demand-supply characteristics. And as I've alluded to, we \u2013 as we sit here today, we don't see anything near term over the next year. So that's likely to disrupt kind of the strong environment that we find ourselves in. So we think that we're going to \u2013 we're going to keep pushing hard today on the pricing increases for new move ins. And today, we are pricing renewals for what we will achieve 60, 90 days from now. And when we get 60, 90 days from now, we will be pricing those renewals at a steeper rate. So it's sort of \u2013 as you say, it's an indication of real strong fundamentals and we don't see anything near-term that is likely to disrupt that. I'll give you an example of it. In Atlanta, as an example, 12% of our move-ins came from outside the Sunbelt, and in 2019, that was a little over 8% in a market like Phoenix, which is incredibly strong in terms of move in some outside the Sunbelt. That was over 21% and so far this year and compared to the same period in 2019 that was a little over 18%. So it's about a 411 basis point jump from 2019 in Phoenix. We're seeing saw big jump in Tampa from 2019, this is about over 18% today versus 13% in 2019. So 380 basis point improvement. So it varies a bit by market, but it's pretty go back to 2019 before COVID. It's up and move-ins from outside the Sunbelt are up and let's see it looking at our markets here, the only market that I see where it's actually the move-ins from outside the Sunbelt are actually down is one and that's Huntsville, Alabama. I mean, broadly the whole place is good, Rich, but the delta between urban, suburban and inner loop and A, B was wider during COVID, both have narrowed. So A&B assets the difference between the two is only a 130 basis points but it's 7.4% for our lagging A and 8.7% for our leading B. I mean those are both numbers I'm happy to have. And then the same real story, it's almost the same for sort of urban inner loop versus the suburban assets, it 7.5% and 8.7%. So there is \u2013 both are strong and there's just a little bit more of a supply headwind in the urban markets, but we don't see them as less desirable. Thank you, Rich. Yes. So we look at this a couple of ways. One is as a cap rate on MAA's trailing 12 numbers that was about a 5.4, but looked at on a \u2013 from a buyer's perspective with kind of adjusted taxes and insurance, it was about a 4.7 cap rate. Going forward on the three that we're looking to sell those \u2013 both of the metrics are very similar because there's not a big re-evaluation of taxes on those, but we're looking in the call it 4.5 or 7.5 range. And John, just to keep in mind, that 4.7 cap rate on the exit from Jackson Mississippi, that's on 36-year old assets. So average age of that portfolio is 36 years old in Jackson, Mississippi. So we have two in Savannah and one that is in Charlotte."

The strong second quarter operating performance produced core FFO that was at the top end of our prior guidance range, $0.08 per share above the midpoint, which also supports improved performance expectations over the remainder of the year. As you saw on our release, we are significantly increasing our guidance for both core FFO and same-store performance for the full year. The increases are primarily based on projections of continued high occupancy levels remaining, essentially full between 95.5% and 96% over the remainder of the year and continued strong rental pricing growth over the second half, particularly during the third quarter with some typical seasonal moderation expected in the fourth quarter. That supports revised revenue growth projection for the full year of 4% at the midpoint of guidance, which is 200 basis points above the prior midpoint. Same-store operating expenses have largely been in line with our expectations for the year. As outlined early in the year, we expected expenses to be somewhat elevated during the first half mainly related to the impact of our double play program. The difficult prior your insurance renewal, as well as some continued pressure on real estate taxes, which would represent about 40% of our total operating costs overall. Hi, Nick, this is Al. I can start with that and maybe Tim and I can join on some of those details. So, I think, obviously, as you saw in the second quarter we had tremendous trend coming from the first quarter. Our average pricing, our blended pricing was 2.7% for the first quarter, 8.2% in the second quarter. And so as you look at the back half and you take the guidance that we put out 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, while obviously assuming continued strength in that. And as I mentioned a bit in my calls, primarily in the third quarter because July, we've seen and it's already very strong, we expect that to continue. We do expect some normal seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter, but still have the strong numbers, but that blends down. So you can do the math on that. You're around, somewhere around 8% for the back half of the year when you did the math of our new guidance. And so, that's with \u2013 obviously with continued strong and stable occupancy that we talked about those are under guidance there. Thanks, Neil. There are two things in that, of course, it's a pretty modest increase in the range overall of 50 basis points, John. But there's really two things in that, one is, property level performance awards for this strong performance that we're seeing expected for the year. And we're very glad to see it and proud of our teams for producing that. So the new some of that... That's probably the bulk of it. And then you have some inflationary pressures on impairment supplies and things that we did, which is typical across, I'd say, everybody right now with full market, but pretty smaller growth. I think if you look historically, over the last several years, in terms of core FFO, third quarter is usually sort of the low point and it's really just with all of the activity going on in third quarter, we have \u2013 the expenses are at their highest point, obviously getting the highest rents as well. But the seasonality of expenses usually drives and I think honestly, like I said, I think if you look at the last several years Q3 is probably our low point in terms of core FFO, nothing structural driving that other than the normal outage. Though, when we look at it, one thing that is interesting, that is occurring Alex is you would think with the large run-up in pricing opportunity for us that that would stress on affordability. But we're seeing affordability, staying at 19% to 20% range or the rent to income ratio I should say in that 19% to 20% range. So the incomes are \u2013 that are coming in are higher and that is \u2013 that's gives us plenty of room to run in that area. Yes, we're getting a very solid $20 to $25 bump in that. And then what we'll begin to see as well, we really underwrote on the thing that we knew we would get or we felt strongly about was the revenue opportunity. We're beginning to see the benefits of our mobile maintenance plan, which was we just installed mobile maintenance or upgraded mobile maintenance for the portfolio in the second quarter. Then that will begin to create some efficiency for us on the expense side, on leak detection, as well as just saving time between units responding to calls real time those kind of things. Thank you, Alex. Yes. I mean that's a relative question, Rob, because at this point in July, our leasing growth, I've got six markets below 10% blended rent growth and the slower of those are DC and Houston, which are I think 5.2% and 5.7% for blended rent growth but that's encouraging progress for those. So I don't think that we've seen \u2013 I don't see any market where it's slowing to be honest with you. In terms of the market, again we'll have seasonal trends as you're well aware of but places like Phoenix and Tampa continue to accelerate in places like Atlanta and Austin have really picked it up recently and we're seeing that on into Dallas and across the portfolio. I mean the number of markets and the majority of our markets are \u2013 a large majority of our markets are now pushing higher than 10% blended rent growth. So I don't see any sort of tipping point that's been reached other than seasonality. And of course, Eric made the point earlier of we're pushing through stout renewal increases and we're getting less pushback than we have historically."

Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 29th, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance of MAA, for opening comments. Please go ahead.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We are encouraged with the solid start to the year as core FFO results were well ahead of our expectations. A recovery in rent growth is clearly getting started. Our overall blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are running slightly ahead of last year, and our forecast is for continued improvement. A combination of the recovery within the Sunbelt economies that is just starting to build, coupled with the continued migration of employers and jobs to this region, are driving higher level of demand across our portfolio. We like the trends that we're seeing as we head into the important summer leasing season. Our teams are off to a strong start this year with our unit interior redevelopment program, the rollout of our Smart Home technology platform as well as several new projects aimed at full repositioning of communities to higher price points. We're excited about the upside in rent growth to capture from all three of these programs. It was about this time last year when we hit the pause button on these projects in order to protect residents and staff during the initial months of COVID, and we expect to make solid progress this year. Our new development platform continues to expand, and we're excited to have closed this month on our first opportunity in the Salt Lake City market.\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. The recovery continued across the portfolio for the first quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 16%. This drove blended pricing achieved during the quarter up 2.7%. This is even with the very strong start we had in the first quarter of 2020 and up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. In addition, we were able to maintain strong average daily occupancy of 95.7%, and all-in place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved to 1.3% in the first quarter. Collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.1% billed rent in the first quarter. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April of last year, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 325 for the April of this year rental assistance plan. This represents only 20 basis points of April billed rent. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. We're off to a strong start for the year on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controlled lights, thermostat in security as well as leak detection.\nBrad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country remains strong. However, a lack of properties for sale is causing a supply demand imbalance that continues to drive already aggressive pricing. This robust investor demand supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates, which are frequently in the mid-3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. Transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020.\nAl Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Core FFO per share performance of $1.64 for the first quarter was $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. As expected, operating trends continued to improve through the quarter, producing same store revenue and NOI performance that was slightly ahead of our forecast, providing about $0.01 per share on favorability for the quarter. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong pricing trends to have a growing impact on effective rents over the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that only about 20% of our leases were effective in the first quarter, and we still have the majority of our leases to be signed during the summer leasing season in the second and third quarter. The remaining favorability came from overhead and interest expense, which were both lower than projections for the quarter. So overhead costs are expected to grow more in line with our original projections as the year progresses as our travel and other activities move toward more normalized levels. Winter storm Uri impacted a portion of our portfolio during the quarter, where unusually cold temperature and electrical outages led to frozen pipes and damage at a number of our Texas communities. Our operating teams worked hard to take care of our residents and get affected units back online quickly. We incurred some casualty losses during the first quarter related to the storm. We established a receivable for the vast majority of the costs, which are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage. Net earnings impact to MAA during the quarter was only about $765,000, primarily related to down units. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the quarter, we paid off the $118 million of secured mortgages at an expiring rate of 5.1%. We also funded an additional $64 million of cost toward completion of our development pipeline, which, at quarter end, included seven communities with total projected cost of $528 million, of which $193 million remains to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we acquired two land parcels in April as part of repurchase development deals, which should begin construction later this year. And as discussed previously, we expect our development pipeline to grow to around $800 million by year end, which is well within our development autonomous limits.\nTim Argo: Christy, are you there?\nOperator:  First question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On your effective lease rates, they were growing steadily throughout each month in the first quarter, and it sounds like April is coming in at 5%. How does that compare to your original projections when you came up with guidance for the year?\nAl Campbell: Yes, John, this is Al. I think Tim and I can both tag team on this one. But I think as we talked about, we had expected to have strong pricing trends in our forecast for the year, and if you take our pricing expectations are built in our forecast, it's somewhere around 2.5% blended for the full year. I think if you take a look at what happened last year, which was about 1.3% pricing, you add what we expect this year, which in terms of revenue, at about half of that production. And you can blend those two together and come up with 2% basis point that we have in our overall revenue. So we're certainly encouraged by the trends that we see in the pricing that Tom talked about. But remember, as we talked about, we've only had about 20% of our leases effective now, and we've got a lot of leases to come in the second and third quarter, so a long way to go yet. And we'll take another look at that in the second quarter.\nTom Grimes: And we did plan for a return to sort of normal seasonality. So we expected it to be accelerating during this time and kind of move, call it, January through July to be accelerating, then start to trend back down a little bit with normal seasonality.\nJohn Kim: So is the April data, is that coming off an easier comp from last year? And you expect that to trend down? Or is it - with seasonality high in the second and third quarter, you expect it to be...\nTom Grimes: Certainly, on new leases, April was kind of the first month last year, where we saw the weakness. So we're getting some good comparability there. But we would expect it to continue to grow from there and kind of return to that seasonality. So I think to Al's point, it's certainly encouraging with the trends we're seeing, and we'll see how it plays out over the next quarter or so.\nJohn Kim: My second question is on the pre-purchase development program. What are the initial stabilized cap rates that you expect to have from that program? And how does that compare to the development yield?\nBrad Hill: Yes. John, this is Brad. So our pre-purchase yields are generally in line with our overall development expectations. So there's really no difference in yields between those two platforms. But I will say, the deals that we have, the seven deals on the books right now, those are generally yielding about 6%. We have seen some pressure relative to construction costs. There's a lot of publications about that. But we would expect around 10 to 20 basis points reduction in costs associated with that. But that's somewhat offset by - if you just look broadly at our footprint in our region of the country, rents continue to do very, very well. So we expect some of that increase in cost and the impact there to be offset by what we expect rents to do within our region.\nJohn Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Just following up on the April lease numbers again. Is the differential between the renewals and the new leases about what you would expect it to be in sort of a normal market for this time of the year? Or is there still some COVID impact that's hitting those numbers?\nTom Grimes: Yes. That is Brad, it's Tom. If things are looking pretty normal, and we would expect to have that gap between new lease and renewal rate at this point in time. It's widest in the winter and then it begins to narrow and tighten in the summer.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then sort of philosophically, I mean, it's been a long, long time since MAA has done any equity issuance. I'm curious, with the market sort of implying a lower cost of equity at this point, whether you would ever think it would make sense to raise money and maybe accelerate development or maybe if you found attractive acquisition opportunities. Or will you continue to sort of just recycle capital and use the cash generated by the business?\nEric Bolton: Brad, this is Eric. At the moment, we believe that the pace under which we're able to find opportunity and deploy capital, coupled with the asset sales that we're going to continue to progress on, we don't see a need for equity. I think it's obviously something we continue to monitor. If the acquisition market began to change in some fashion that really yielded a lot more external growth opportunity, we'd have to revisit that point. But for the moment, we believe that between the recycling and the deployment opportunities we have, and the capacity we have on the balance sheet, we like where we are and don't feel a need to tap the equity markets.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Similar to the last question, I mean, recognizing that competition for assets is really strong and cap rates are low. But given some of the growth you're seeing and the strength in sort of the economic recovery here, I mean, have you considered changing your underwriting and getting a little bit more aggressive in growth in some of the acquisition deals that you're taking a look at?\nEric Bolton: Well, I mean, this is Eric. I mean, we constantly challenge our thinking a bit on our underwriting and make sure that we're being as realistic as we can be in what we expect rent growth to do. And so I think that at the end of the day, we're looking at adding stabilized yields to our portfolio that will increase the overall earnings potential of the portfolio long term. And I think that right now, what we see happening on the acquisition side, frankly, requires a level of reach and a level of assumption for a very long period of time that we have a hard time sort of getting comfortable with. We can make the numbers work on both the pre-purchase program and on the new development. Certainly, it's dilution associated with the lease-up and the construction process there. But once those assets get fully stabilized, I mean, the yield is there pretty quick. On the acquisition front, I think right now, frankly, you would have to be comfortable with, I believe, a level of dilution that is longer, frankly, than what we're able to do on the development front and pre-purchase front. So we think we're pushing it in terms of assumptions about as hard as we should, and beyond what we're doing right now would require a level of reach that, frankly, we're just not comfortable with.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood, and appreciate the thoughts. And then just going back to guidance. I mean, we touched on lease rates a bit. And given how strong they've been, it sounds like occupancy is also continuing to ramp into April. So can you just kind of walk through the assumptions there for the back half of the year and how you're thinking occupancy trends through the balance of the year?\nAl Campbell: Yes. So occupancy going into the year, we dialed in about a 10 basis point drop in occupancy compared to last year as we focus on pushing pricing. So with somewhere around 95.5%, 95.6% or so. So kind of given where Q1 was and where we stand right now, we feel good about that. So we'd expect that to be pretty steady, and again, focus given this environment, focus a little more on pushing rents where we can and kind of hold occupancy where it is.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. Appreciate it, thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Your revenue growth recently by some of your smaller markets. Are there any differences between rent income metrics in those markets relative to the larger markets? Or anything else that would impact your ability to continue pushing those large rent increases going forward?\nEric Bolton: No. Amanda, the rent to income ratios in our small market is right or small markets is in line with those larger markets. So we feel like the opportunity will continue there. Not worried about that at all.\nAmanda Sweitzer: Okay. And then it's relatively small dollars, but you had another double-digit increase in marketing expenses this quarter. Is that being caused by competitive new supply or driven by any specific markets? And do you expect similar rates of increase going forward?\nTom Grimes: Yes. And I think on expenses for the year, we'll see this. There's a little bit of variability in prior year comparisons. But for the full year, marketing will be at or below 3%. And it's a combination of things. It is both our lead generating activities, but some of the pressure this - or some of the expense in this quarter was bringing online some new tools as it relates to online lead nurturing in our call center solutions, which are helping keep our - which will help keep our personnel costs flat for the year.\nAmanda Sweitzer:  thanks, appreciate the time.\nOperator: Next question is from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kalmus: Looking at move-ins from out of state, what did that percentage look like in the first quarter? And how is that trending versus history? I believe last quarter was 12.2% and was at the highest rate. So curious how that's trending.\nTom Grimes: Yes. That's continued on. It's right at the same percentage, and that trend is up from - we've been tracking that for a couple of years. Low point was in Q1 of 2019, where it was 9.2%. So it's still about a 290 basis point increase or so, and that trend is continuing.\nEric Bolton: I would add, Alex, this is Eric, that that's at a portfolio level. And so some of our secondary markets, it tends to be a little bit below that average, whereas you start to look at some of the markets like Austin, Phoenix, Raleigh, some of the markets that are more likely to be benefiting from some of the migration out of California and places like that, it tends to be a little bit higher. As an example, in the first quarter, our move-ins from out of state in Phoenix would double that number. Over 24% of our move-ins in Phoenix in the first quarter came from out of state.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you for the color. Another - just a question on the development. So the yields are around 6%. What is the spread versus a traditional cap rate on acquisitions today? And is that a similar spread as historical? Or has that spread gotten tighter or expanded because of what we're seeing in the acquisition market?\nEric Bolton: Yes. Alex, I would say the spread is 100, 150 basis points on average. And given just the amount of capital that's looking for acquisitions right now and how that's driven down the cap rates and yields on acquisitions. And certainly, development has been impacted a little bit by construction costs. But I would say in my - as I said in my opening comments, cap rates are down 50 basis points year-over-year. So I would say the spread has probably gotten a little bit bigger, given how much the yields on existing acquisitions have compressed.\nAlex Kalmus: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeil Malkin: First question, bigger picture question, Eric, maybe for you. When you think about the Sunbelt markets and how clearly you guys are going to get a bigger portion of the pie of existing and then future employees with all the corp. relocations, etc.? When you look at your multiple growth drivers, lower balance sheet and where cap rates are trading in the market. I mean, is it fair to say that you guys are undervalued even at current levels, and really, there should be a rerating, particularly across Sunbelt markets and a portfolio like yours?\nEric Bolton: Well, Neil, I do think that at least from what we see that the dynamics that are sort of driving job growth, and ultimately, our ability to drive rent growth as compared to the non-Sunbelt markets. I think that, that overall sort of dynamic has clearly begun to shift. And that shift was under way, certainly somewhat prior to COVID. And as much has been reported on, I think COVID accelerated a lot of those trends. And so I think that, that's one factor that would suggest to me that the demand dynamics and the driver of rent growth dynamics for Sunbelt versus non-Sunbelt, I think it's a new day in that regard. The second thing I would tell you is that, I think, cap rates have begun to adjust a bit in terms of how real estate is being priced in gateway versus Sunbelt markets. I think for many, many years that a lot of investor demand really drove cap rates down in a lot of these gateway markets, particularly a lot of international capital that, frankly, was just more familiar with and more knowledgeable of some of these bigger gateway markets. I think, again, the last few years, particularly, the past year, has begun to, I think, open eyes in the investment community a bit about the shifts that are going on in the US regarding job growth and population trends and taxes and all the other sort of factors that continue to favor the Sunbelt. And I think international capital is also paying attention to that. And I think as a consequence of that, I think the historic delta between cap rates for gateway versus non-gateway markets, I think that those cap rates have compressed certainly today. And I think they will remain more compressed or that gap will be more narrow than it has been historically. So I think there is some logic to what you're saying for both of those reasons, and I think the next few years will tell a lot about how these companies are able to perform, the platform is able to perform and how investor appetite continues to evolve. And I do think that there is some logic to what you used to think about five or six years ago in terms of pricing of real estate in Sunbelt markets versus where we should be pricing it today on a relative basis to non-Sunbelt. It's a different day.\nNeil Malkin: Yes. I totally agree. It's a great day. Next question is about the operating side. A lot of, I think, recent conversations about technology and how that's shaping kind of the new wave of sort of institutional asset management, property management. Can you just kind of talk about what technology looks like for you guys and how you think about it, say, over the next three years in terms of implementing enhancements to the revenue maximization, I mean? And then on the expense side, just like with how you think leasing is going to be, property level headcount, anything along those lines would be really interesting and I think something that we need to be on a look out for over the next couple of years.\nBrad Hill: Neil, I'll kind of give you a high-level overview of, and you're correct. I mean, there's a transformation under way in our business. Currently, what we have rolling is an expanded - call center solution is out and that allowed us to make some staffing headcount reduction changes about how leasing phone calls are handled on-site. We've also deployed a lead nurturing software, which is automated prospect engagement technology, so to interact with the prospects earlier in the sales process and automates the follow ups. We've upgraded the virtual touring. We've implemented mobile inspections, which really makes it a lot clearer to the resident, the condition of their apartment when they move in, and then clearly document the deficiencies if they move out. That's helped us with speed of inspection as well as clarity on billing and resident satisfaction. We're midway through deploying our mobile maintenance solution, which will give us some efficiency on that side of the business. What's coming next, has improved. I mean, we've got self-touring, but automating that process. We've got some tests ongoing with improved multi-location sales support, covering one property from another one. And I would expect the things we have under way right now built into the 2021 budget is a 30 positions or about 3% of our office staff. This will be handled through attrition. And then I would expect through attrition and automation, we see another 30 to 50 headcount reduction in 2022.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. So you're saying 30 this year and then 30 to 50 next year?\nBrad Hill: Yes. At this point, it's an evolving process.\nNeil Malkin: Sure, sure. Yeah, no, I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Brad, one follow-up on your comments on the yield compression on development, the 20 basis point deal compression, is that on projects that you've already started or about to start? Or is that on kind of new land you're currently sourcing?\nBrad Hill: Yes. That's on new, John. So the projects that we have under construction right now, those are intact. No impact on construction costs or anything like that. Those are locked in when we start construction. Those returns in rents and lease up, as I made a point in my comments, are all on schedule. So those are intact. So my reference really was to the impact of costs related to new starts that we would have today and new underwritings that we have today on the development side.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And these construction cost pressures continue improve more structural and less transient, you have the supply chain bottlenecks continuing, do you sense that it will be finally enough to break the fever on starts? If we're talking this time next year or probably not giving the spread to cap rates?\nEric Bolton: John, this is Eric. I certainly hope so, but I don't know. I'm skeptical that certainly that the pressures that we've seen thus far are sufficient to have any meaningful impact to slowing the interest level on development at the moment because of the fact that we are seeing the demand growth and the rent growth opportunity continue to improve and get stronger. And I think that's fueling a level of tolerance and optimism on the underwriting side and the ability to withstand some level of cost increase. Where I think that you could see - and the other thing I would also add, as long as cap rates continue to remain as low as they are, providing the developer the opportunity to exit at today's cap rate environment, I think that - again, that, that supports, at some level, the ability to withstand some increase in cost. One of the things, though, that we're beginning to see increasingly affect development more than anything other than land cost is just the permitting and zoning processes are getting increasingly difficult. And I think that as we continue to see some of these Sunbelt markets facing much population growth and demand growth and some of these infrastructures start to get under a little pressure, I think you may see a little bit more stringent behavior out of some of the local governments and zoning and permitting folks to be a little bit more restrictive than they have been in the past. And I think that probably as much, as anything else, may start to moderate things. I'm comfortable that with all the things that I just went through, that it's likely that supply is not likely to materially increase the levels that we see happening right now. I think the pipelines are full and there's just too much pressure at this point to see any material increase in supply pressure. But I think we're a ways away from seeing a material decline in pressure.\nJohn Pawlowski: Understood. Final question for me. Al, you mentioned the down units in Texas. Could you give us a sense for just kind of the revenue impact these coming months or quarters from these down units, acknowledging it's small on the grand scheme of things?\nAl Campbell: I'll just start with that, and I think Tom can answer that. I think what we'd say is, teams - as we talked about in the comments, teams worked very hard to get the vast majority of those units online quickly. And I'd say, as we get through the end of April, we have a very few left, only a handful of units that are down. So overall, as you've seen, what I talked about in my comments, the impact, you've seen the majority of that impact in the first quarter already, John. A little bit will trail, but most of that has been handled. Maybe Tom, you might?\nTom Grimes: Yes, no, John. I mean, we had a total of 251 down as a result of the freeze, 107 of those are already back up. And the remainder will be up shortly. We had a lot more with damage, but the teams were able to service those units without generating turnover in it. So they didn't go to down status.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Two questions. First, on the concession impact to your portfolio currently, I don't think you break that out unless I missed it. Can you just give us a feel for concessions, how much they're impacting your effective rents right now? And kind of your assumption about how - if you get a benefit from removing those concessions, how that helps rental pricing later this year? How are you thinking about that?\nTom Grimes: Yes, Nick, I'll give you a quick overview. And as you know, we price on a net effective basis. So concessions are really only used when the immediate comps in the submarket are using them. And our concessions are in the lease-over-lease rates that we share with you. But where we're doing at concessions, for the same store group peaked in third quarter of this year at 1.2% of net potential, and it's dropped to just 80 basis points of net potential for the first quarter of this year. So that's just sort of following this general trend of improved pricing power.\nBrad Hill: I'll add to that, Nick, that our same store revenue results, the way we reported includes those being spread over the life of the lease.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Great. Just my other question was on in migration to your markets. You have cited this in the past, you gave some data. I don't think you gave an update today. But in terms of move and benefit from sort of outside of your markets, people coming to your portfolio from coastal areas, etc., you also gave some stats in the past about searches for rentals in cities such as Atlanta. So I guess, I'm just wondering if you have an update on that. And also whether that benefit has changed at all because, obviously, we're starting to see some improvement in occupancy in coastal markets. So just trying to understand how that's impacting your portfolio.\nTom Grimes: The trend has continued. It was in 2019, it was 9.2% of our move-ins from around the market. It's moved up to 12% alone in the first quarter. That's about where it was for the fourth quarter. And then we're still seeing them high demand of search rates. And as Eric pointed out earlier, that's at a portfolio level read. And some of our secondary markets get a little less of that in migration. In place - for instance, in a place like Phoenix, it was double that rate of in migration from out of area. So very much - that trend is very much alive and a big part of the bright future of the Sunbelt.\nNick Yulico: Great, thank you everyone.\nOperator: And our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: How are you thinking about the further build out of Salt Lake City and how large could that market become?\nBrad Hill: Nick, this is Brad. As we said, when we first started looking at Salt Lake, for operational efficiencies, we'd like to get that market to, call it, six to eight projects in the first stage for us, given just the dynamics of Salt Lake City is to go in there and partner with a developer who has a presence there and an ability to quickly add through development two or three, four projects. And then the next phase we'll be trying to buy through acquisitions, with the final step being our development team perhaps coming in there and building from the ground up. So we're well under way with that with a new project that we have announced there. As I said, we have a development partner that we're partnered with there that has a partner in the market. So they're actively looking and evaluating new sites, and we're hopeful that we can quickly add to our presence there.\nNick Joseph: Are there any other deals currently in the pipeline?\nBrad Hill: Not for Salt Lake City, no. There's one land site that is currently under LOI, but there's not one that's imminent at the moment.\nNick Joseph: And then are there any other new market entries expected in the near term?\nEric Bolton: Nick, this is Eric. Nothing specific. I mean, we continue to look at opportunities in some other markets. But at the moment, beyond what Brad just mentioned, we're working some land sites in Tampa. We're controlling a land site in the Research Triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area at the moment. We've got another couple of sites in Denver that we're working. But it's still all within our same footprint at the moment.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.\nRob Stevenson: Just to follow-up, I mean, how many projects other than the two that you guys brought on the land deals do you expect to start in 2021 this year from a development standpoint?\nBrad Hill: Rob, this is Brad. We have two that we're hopeful we can start this year. But again, those are in due diligence, so obviously, anything can happen at any point in time with those. But that's at this point what we're working toward. As we mentioned, we do have other sites under control and under contract, but those are more likely 2022 starts.\nEric Bolton: We've got a 27-acre site in Denver area called Central Park, east of the old Stapleton Airport area that we are currently doing predevelopment on. And we would hope to be able to start that late this year, the Phase 1. It will be a three-phase project. So it will be a big project for us. So we're hopeful we can get that one started late this year, in addition to the two I've mentioned in Salt Lake and in - the new one in Atlanta.\nRob Stevenson: And what's the rough construction costs expected on the two that you're about to start here?\nEric Bolton: So let's see. I got it right here. Yes. Salt Lake City, the project is I think it's $94 million.\nAl Campbell: Both of them are right around $90 million.\nEric Bolton: Yes. $90 million for Salt Lake City, $94 million for West Midtown.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And so you're going to have the Arizona project delivering here. And so that will come out, you'll replace that with two other projects. And so, at least temporarily, until you get the back half of the year and you start to deliver more of the other ones, your pipeline will go up to somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million is the way to think about it?\nAl Campbell: Well, I think we talked about around - follow that math, how you got there. But what I would say is, as I talked about a bit in the call, we would expect once we start these, the deals they are talked about and a couple that are possible, we kind of put in a couple of potential starts, as Eric talked about, the rest of the year beyond what Brad has talked about. And we could see easily our pipeline getting to what's committed, what's the project, their total cost, what's under way being about $800 million or so about year-end. Yes, a big difference. Slipped a couple of the numbers there, but the $800 million or so. And that's certainly well within the tolerance range that we've talked about in the past. So that's what we're expecting.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then Al, what's the ongoing cost from the high-speed bulk cable package? You guys noted in the release that it's 80 basis points hit same store expense growth. I mean, how far into the future does that continue? When does that start to really sort of burn down or runoff, etc.?\nAl Campbell: I'll let Tim give you the details on that. We'll get pretty close to the end.\nTim Argo: Yes. I think for the full year, we're expecting that to be, call it, 70 basis points of expense impact in 2021. And certainly, we're getting revenue impact on it as well. It will have a little bit of outsized impact in next year, but not to the level of 70. And then I think as we get to 2023, it becomes a sort of a normal line item, if you will.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then last one for me. Tom, any markets stronger or weaker than you guys had expected thus far in 2021?\nTom Grimes: Yes. I mean on the stronger side, I would put Orlando in that bucket. They were on my, a little bit of a, laggard list. But as far as the shift in blended pricing from Q4 to Q1, they're up like 430 basis points on a blended pricing basis. And it is good to see Orlando catch its gear again. The theme Disney opened now last two theme parks, maybe it was a month ago, and really the feedback we're getting is that's brought hospitality back. And restaurant is back, and it is moving along again. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in Orlando.\nRob Stevenson: And anything weaker than you expected thus far?\nTom Grimes: No. The push forward has been pretty positive. I mean we're still worried about DC and Houston. They are recovering, but at a slower pace.\nRob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And obviously, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to us any time. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We are encouraged with the solid start to the year as core FFO results were well ahead of our expectations. A recovery in rent growth is clearly getting started. Our overall blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are running slightly ahead of last year, and our forecast is for continued improvement. A combination of the recovery within the Sunbelt economies that is just starting to build, coupled with the continued migration of employers and jobs to this region, are driving higher level of demand across our portfolio. We like the trends that we're seeing as we head into the important summer leasing season. Our teams are off to a strong start this year with our unit interior redevelopment program, the rollout of our Smart Home technology platform as well as several new projects aimed at full repositioning of communities to higher price points. We're excited about the upside in rent growth to capture from all three of these programs. It was about this time last year when we hit the pause button on these projects in order to protect residents and staff during the initial months of COVID, and we expect to make solid progress this year. Our new development platform continues to expand, and we're excited to have closed this month on our first opportunity in the Salt Lake City market. Brad, this is Eric. At the moment, we believe that the pace under which we're able to find opportunity and deploy capital, coupled with the asset sales that we're going to continue to progress on, we don't see a need for equity. I think it's obviously something we continue to monitor. If the acquisition market began to change in some fashion that really yielded a lot more external growth opportunity, we'd have to revisit that point. But for the moment, we believe that between the recycling and the deployment opportunities we have, and the capacity we have on the balance sheet, we like where we are and don't feel a need to tap the equity markets. Well, I mean, this is Eric. I mean, we constantly challenge our thinking a bit on our underwriting and make sure that we're being as realistic as we can be in what we expect rent growth to do. And so I think that at the end of the day, we're looking at adding stabilized yields to our portfolio that will increase the overall earnings potential of the portfolio long term. And I think that right now, what we see happening on the acquisition side, frankly, requires a level of reach and a level of assumption for a very long period of time that we have a hard time sort of getting comfortable with. We can make the numbers work on both the pre-purchase program and on the new development. Certainly, it's dilution associated with the lease-up and the construction process there. But once those assets get fully stabilized, I mean, the yield is there pretty quick. On the acquisition front, I think right now, frankly, you would have to be comfortable with, I believe, a level of dilution that is longer, frankly, than what we're able to do on the development front and pre-purchase front. So we think we're pushing it in terms of assumptions about as hard as we should, and beyond what we're doing right now would require a level of reach that, frankly, we're just not comfortable with. No. Amanda, the rent to income ratios in our small market is right or small markets is in line with those larger markets. So we feel like the opportunity will continue there. Not worried about that at all. I would add, Alex, this is Eric, that that's at a portfolio level. And so some of our secondary markets, it tends to be a little bit below that average, whereas you start to look at some of the markets like Austin, Phoenix, Raleigh, some of the markets that are more likely to be benefiting from some of the migration out of California and places like that, it tends to be a little bit higher. As an example, in the first quarter, our move-ins from out of state in Phoenix would double that number. Over 24% of our move-ins in Phoenix in the first quarter came from out of state. Yes. Alex, I would say the spread is 100, 150 basis points on average. And given just the amount of capital that's looking for acquisitions right now and how that's driven down the cap rates and yields on acquisitions. And certainly, development has been impacted a little bit by construction costs. But I would say in my - as I said in my opening comments, cap rates are down 50 basis points year-over-year. So I would say the spread has probably gotten a little bit bigger, given how much the yields on existing acquisitions have compressed. Well, Neil, I do think that at least from what we see that the dynamics that are sort of driving job growth, and ultimately, our ability to drive rent growth as compared to the non-Sunbelt markets. I think that, that overall sort of dynamic has clearly begun to shift. And that shift was under way, certainly somewhat prior to COVID. And as much has been reported on, I think COVID accelerated a lot of those trends. And so I think that, that's one factor that would suggest to me that the demand dynamics and the driver of rent growth dynamics for Sunbelt versus non-Sunbelt, I think it's a new day in that regard. The second thing I would tell you is that, I think, cap rates have begun to adjust a bit in terms of how real estate is being priced in gateway versus Sunbelt markets. I think for many, many years that a lot of investor demand really drove cap rates down in a lot of these gateway markets, particularly a lot of international capital that, frankly, was just more familiar with and more knowledgeable of some of these bigger gateway markets. I think, again, the last few years, particularly, the past year, has begun to, I think, open eyes in the investment community a bit about the shifts that are going on in the US regarding job growth and population trends and taxes and all the other sort of factors that continue to favor the Sunbelt. And I think international capital is also paying attention to that. And I think as a consequence of that, I think the historic delta between cap rates for gateway versus non-gateway markets, I think that those cap rates have compressed certainly today. And I think they will remain more compressed or that gap will be more narrow than it has been historically. So I think there is some logic to what you're saying for both of those reasons, and I think the next few years will tell a lot about how these companies are able to perform, the platform is able to perform and how investor appetite continues to evolve. And I do think that there is some logic to what you used to think about five or six years ago in terms of pricing of real estate in Sunbelt markets versus where we should be pricing it today on a relative basis to non-Sunbelt. It's a different day. John, this is Eric. I certainly hope so, but I don't know. I'm skeptical that certainly that the pressures that we've seen thus far are sufficient to have any meaningful impact to slowing the interest level on development at the moment because of the fact that we are seeing the demand growth and the rent growth opportunity continue to improve and get stronger. And I think that's fueling a level of tolerance and optimism on the underwriting side and the ability to withstand some level of cost increase. Where I think that you could see - and the other thing I would also add, as long as cap rates continue to remain as low as they are, providing the developer the opportunity to exit at today's cap rate environment, I think that - again, that, that supports, at some level, the ability to withstand some increase in cost. One of the things, though, that we're beginning to see increasingly affect development more than anything other than land cost is just the permitting and zoning processes are getting increasingly difficult. And I think that as we continue to see some of these Sunbelt markets facing much population growth and demand growth and some of these infrastructures start to get under a little pressure, I think you may see a little bit more stringent behavior out of some of the local governments and zoning and permitting folks to be a little bit more restrictive than they have been in the past. And I think that probably as much, as anything else, may start to moderate things. I'm comfortable that with all the things that I just went through, that it's likely that supply is not likely to materially increase the levels that we see happening right now. I think the pipelines are full and there's just too much pressure at this point to see any material increase in supply pressure. But I think we're a ways away from seeing a material decline in pressure. Nick, this is Eric. Nothing specific. I mean, we continue to look at opportunities in some other markets. But at the moment, beyond what Brad just mentioned, we're working some land sites in Tampa. We're controlling a land site in the Research Triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area at the moment. We've got another couple of sites in Denver that we're working. But it's still all within our same footprint at the moment. We've got a 27-acre site in Denver area called Central Park, east of the old Stapleton Airport area that we are currently doing predevelopment on. And we would hope to be able to start that late this year, the Phase 1. It will be a three-phase project. So it will be a big project for us. So we're hopeful we can get that one started late this year, in addition to the two I've mentioned in Salt Lake and in - the new one in Atlanta. So let's see. I got it right here. Yes. Salt Lake City, the project is I think it's $94 million. Yes. $90 million for Salt Lake City, $94 million for West Midtown. Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And obviously, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to us any time. Thank you."

This drove blended pricing achieved during the quarter up 2.7%. This is even with the very strong start we had in the first quarter of 2020 and up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. In addition, we were able to maintain strong average daily occupancy of 95.7%, and all-in place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved to 1.3% in the first quarter. Collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.1% billed rent in the first quarter. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April of last year, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 325 for the April of this year rental assistance plan. This represents only 20 basis points of April billed rent. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. We're off to a strong start for the year on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controlled lights, thermostat in security as well as leak detection. And we did plan for a return to sort of normal seasonality. So we expected it to be accelerating during this time and kind of move, call it, January through July to be accelerating, then start to trend back down a little bit with normal seasonality. Certainly, on new leases, April was kind of the first month last year, where we saw the weakness. So we're getting some good comparability there. But we would expect it to continue to grow from there and kind of return to that seasonality. So I think to Al's point, it's certainly encouraging with the trends we're seeing, and we'll see how it plays out over the next quarter or so. Yes. That is Brad, it's Tom. If things are looking pretty normal, and we would expect to have that gap between new lease and renewal rate at this point in time. It's widest in the winter and then it begins to narrow and tighten in the summer. Yes. And I think on expenses for the year, we'll see this. There's a little bit of variability in prior year comparisons. But for the full year, marketing will be at or below 3%. And it's a combination of things. It is both our lead generating activities, but some of the pressure this - or some of the expense in this quarter was bringing online some new tools as it relates to online lead nurturing in our call center solutions, which are helping keep our - which will help keep our personnel costs flat for the year. Yes. That's continued on. It's right at the same percentage, and that trend is up from - we've been tracking that for a couple of years. Low point was in Q1 of 2019, where it was 9.2%. So it's still about a 290 basis point increase or so, and that trend is continuing. Yes, no, John. I mean, we had a total of 251 down as a result of the freeze, 107 of those are already back up. And the remainder will be up shortly. We had a lot more with damage, but the teams were able to service those units without generating turnover in it. So they didn't go to down status. Yes, Nick, I'll give you a quick overview. And as you know, we price on a net effective basis. So concessions are really only used when the immediate comps in the submarket are using them. And our concessions are in the lease-over-lease rates that we share with you. But where we're doing at concessions, for the same store group peaked in third quarter of this year at 1.2% of net potential, and it's dropped to just 80 basis points of net potential for the first quarter of this year. So that's just sort of following this general trend of improved pricing power. The trend has continued. It was in 2019, it was 9.2% of our move-ins from around the market. It's moved up to 12% alone in the first quarter. That's about where it was for the fourth quarter. And then we're still seeing them high demand of search rates. And as Eric pointed out earlier, that's at a portfolio level read. And some of our secondary markets get a little less of that in migration. In place - for instance, in a place like Phoenix, it was double that rate of in migration from out of area. So very much - that trend is very much alive and a big part of the bright future of the Sunbelt. Yes. I mean on the stronger side, I would put Orlando in that bucket. They were on my, a little bit of a, laggard list. But as far as the shift in blended pricing from Q4 to Q1, they're up like 430 basis points on a blended pricing basis. And it is good to see Orlando catch its gear again. The theme Disney opened now last two theme parks, maybe it was a month ago, and really the feedback we're getting is that's brought hospitality back. And restaurant is back, and it is moving along again. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in Orlando. No. The push forward has been pretty positive. I mean we're still worried about DC and Houston. They are recovering, but at a slower pace."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country remains strong. However, a lack of properties for sale is causing a supply demand imbalance that continues to drive already aggressive pricing. This robust investor demand supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates, which are frequently in the mid-3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. Transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020. Yes. John, this is Brad. So our pre-purchase yields are generally in line with our overall development expectations. So there's really no difference in yields between those two platforms. But I will say, the deals that we have, the seven deals on the books right now, those are generally yielding about 6%. We have seen some pressure relative to construction costs. There's a lot of publications about that. But we would expect around 10 to 20 basis points reduction in costs associated with that. But that's somewhat offset by - if you just look broadly at our footprint in our region of the country, rents continue to do very, very well. So we expect some of that increase in cost and the impact there to be offset by what we expect rents to do within our region. Neil, I'll kind of give you a high-level overview of, and you're correct. I mean, there's a transformation under way in our business. Currently, what we have rolling is an expanded - call center solution is out and that allowed us to make some staffing headcount reduction changes about how leasing phone calls are handled on-site. We've also deployed a lead nurturing software, which is automated prospect engagement technology, so to interact with the prospects earlier in the sales process and automates the follow ups. We've upgraded the virtual touring. We've implemented mobile inspections, which really makes it a lot clearer to the resident, the condition of their apartment when they move in, and then clearly document the deficiencies if they move out. That's helped us with speed of inspection as well as clarity on billing and resident satisfaction. We're midway through deploying our mobile maintenance solution, which will give us some efficiency on that side of the business. What's coming next, has improved. I mean, we've got self-touring, but automating that process. We've got some tests ongoing with improved multi-location sales support, covering one property from another one. And I would expect the things we have under way right now built into the 2021 budget is a 30 positions or about 3% of our office staff. This will be handled through attrition. And then I would expect through attrition and automation, we see another 30 to 50 headcount reduction in 2022. Yes. At this point, it's an evolving process. Yes. That's on new, John. So the projects that we have under construction right now, those are intact. No impact on construction costs or anything like that. Those are locked in when we start construction. Those returns in rents and lease up, as I made a point in my comments, are all on schedule. So those are intact. So my reference really was to the impact of costs related to new starts that we would have today and new underwritings that we have today on the development side. I'll add to that, Nick, that our same store revenue results, the way we reported includes those being spread over the life of the lease. Nick, this is Brad. As we said, when we first started looking at Salt Lake, for operational efficiencies, we'd like to get that market to, call it, six to eight projects in the first stage for us, given just the dynamics of Salt Lake City is to go in there and partner with a developer who has a presence there and an ability to quickly add through development two or three, four projects. And then the next phase we'll be trying to buy through acquisitions, with the final step being our development team perhaps coming in there and building from the ground up. So we're well under way with that with a new project that we have announced there. As I said, we have a development partner that we're partnered with there that has a partner in the market. So they're actively looking and evaluating new sites, and we're hopeful that we can quickly add to our presence there. Not for Salt Lake City, no. There's one land site that is currently under LOI, but there's not one that's imminent at the moment. Rob, this is Brad. We have two that we're hopeful we can start this year. But again, those are in due diligence, so obviously, anything can happen at any point in time with those. But that's at this point what we're working toward. As we mentioned, we do have other sites under control and under contract, but those are more likely 2022 starts."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Core FFO per share performance of $1.64 for the first quarter was $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. As expected, operating trends continued to improve through the quarter, producing same store revenue and NOI performance that was slightly ahead of our forecast, providing about $0.01 per share on favorability for the quarter. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong pricing trends to have a growing impact on effective rents over the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that only about 20% of our leases were effective in the first quarter, and we still have the majority of our leases to be signed during the summer leasing season in the second and third quarter. The remaining favorability came from overhead and interest expense, which were both lower than projections for the quarter. So overhead costs are expected to grow more in line with our original projections as the year progresses as our travel and other activities move toward more normalized levels. Winter storm Uri impacted a portion of our portfolio during the quarter, where unusually cold temperature and electrical outages led to frozen pipes and damage at a number of our Texas communities. Our operating teams worked hard to take care of our residents and get affected units back online quickly. We incurred some casualty losses during the first quarter related to the storm. We established a receivable for the vast majority of the costs, which are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage. Net earnings impact to MAA during the quarter was only about $765,000, primarily related to down units. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the quarter, we paid off the $118 million of secured mortgages at an expiring rate of 5.1%. We also funded an additional $64 million of cost toward completion of our development pipeline, which, at quarter end, included seven communities with total projected cost of $528 million, of which $193 million remains to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we acquired two land parcels in April as part of repurchase development deals, which should begin construction later this year. And as discussed previously, we expect our development pipeline to grow to around $800 million by year end, which is well within our development autonomous limits. Yes, John, this is Al. I think Tim and I can both tag team on this one. But I think as we talked about, we had expected to have strong pricing trends in our forecast for the year, and if you take our pricing expectations are built in our forecast, it's somewhere around 2.5% blended for the full year. I think if you take a look at what happened last year, which was about 1.3% pricing, you add what we expect this year, which in terms of revenue, at about half of that production. And you can blend those two together and come up with 2% basis point that we have in our overall revenue. So we're certainly encouraged by the trends that we see in the pricing that Tom talked about. But remember, as we talked about, we've only had about 20% of our leases effective now, and we've got a lot of leases to come in the second and third quarter, so a long way to go yet. And we'll take another look at that in the second quarter. Yes. So occupancy going into the year, we dialed in about a 10 basis point drop in occupancy compared to last year as we focus on pushing pricing. So with somewhere around 95.5%, 95.6% or so. So kind of given where Q1 was and where we stand right now, we feel good about that. So we'd expect that to be pretty steady, and again, focus given this environment, focus a little more on pushing rents where we can and kind of hold occupancy where it is. I'll just start with that, and I think Tom can answer that. I think what we'd say is, teams - as we talked about in the comments, teams worked very hard to get the vast majority of those units online quickly. And I'd say, as we get through the end of April, we have a very few left, only a handful of units that are down. So overall, as you've seen, what I talked about in my comments, the impact, you've seen the majority of that impact in the first quarter already, John. A little bit will trail, but most of that has been handled. Maybe Tom, you might? Both of them are right around $90 million. Well, I think we talked about around - follow that math, how you got there. But what I would say is, as I talked about a bit in the call, we would expect once we start these, the deals they are talked about and a couple that are possible, we kind of put in a couple of potential starts, as Eric talked about, the rest of the year beyond what Brad has talked about. And we could see easily our pipeline getting to what's committed, what's the project, their total cost, what's under way being about $800 million or so about year-end. Yes, a big difference. Slipped a couple of the numbers there, but the $800 million or so. And that's certainly well within the tolerance range that we've talked about in the past. So that's what we're expecting. I'll let Tim give you the details on that. We'll get pretty close to the end."

I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Natty and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the difference between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial deck.

MAA wrapped up calendar year 2022 with fourth quarter results for core FFO that were ahead of expectations as higher fee income along with continued growth in average rent per unit and strong occupancy more than offset pressure from higher real estate taxes.  Looking ahead to the coming year, there is clearly some uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the employment markets, the pace of inflation and the broader economy. In addition, while we do know that new supply deliveries in 2023 broadly will be higher than in 2022, we continue to believe that MAA is well positioned for the coming year as the leasing market returns to more normalized conditions.  Our expectations for the coming year are built on a lease-over-lease pricing environment of 3%. This performance assumption, coupled with the earn-in from 2022's rent growth should drive growth in effective rent per unit of around 7% over the coming year. We will, of course, see conditions vary some by market and submarket location, but we believe that our portfolio is in a uniquely solid position to weather expected moderation from the historically high rate growth of last year.  This view is really supported by three key variables: first, we continue to believe that our Sunbelt footprint maintains an advantageous position for capturing demand, given the stronger and more stable employment markets in the Sunbelt states. We continue to see job growth, positive migration trends, affordable rent-to-income ratios and low resident turnover.  Secondly, MAA's unique diversification across the Sunbelt region, including both large and high-growth secondary markets, provides exposure to a good range of employment sectors and works to help soften some of the pressures surrounding new supply levels in a number of our larger markets. And thirdly, with a rent price point average for our portfolio that appeals to our broad segment of the rental market and it is around 20% below the price point of the mostly high-end new product being delivered, we believe we will capture more stability and top-line performance as leasing conditions normalize in 2023. In the event that we do find ourselves later in the year headed towards a more severe contraction in the economy or a recession, as MAA has consistently demonstrated over the past 20 years, we expect to perform with a lower level of volatility than what generally is seen with more concentrated portfolios and/or those costs traded in large coastal markets. The transaction market remains very quiet and we are likewise remaining patient with what opportunities we do see. I expect it will be the second half of the year before pricing data becomes more readily available. We do have plans to initiate development on four new projects in 2023 associated with sites that we already own or that are under our control. These projects will, of course, not actually start delivering units for another couple of years. In conclusion, I want to give a big thank you to our MAA associates for their tremendous service and record performance in2022.  We have the company well positioned for the next cycle, as a number of new tech initiatives will positively impact performance over the coming years. Our external growth pipeline continues to expand and the balance sheet provides a good, strong foundation for supporting our current portfolio operations, as well as active pursuit of new growth opportunities. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. While pricing performance moderated during the fourth quarter from the record growth we had achieved September year-to-date, blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 5.7%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the fourth quarter was 14.9%, versus the prior year and 2.0% sequentially from the prior quarter. Full year 2022 blended lease-over-lease pricing was 13.9%, helping to drive full year effective rent growth of 14.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.6% for the fourth quarter and 95.7% for the full year 2022. In line with normal seasonality, our January new lease rate of negative 0.3% improved from December's new lease rate of negative 0.9% and other than 2022 represents a higher new lease rate than any year since we have been tracking the data. Combined with renewal pricing of 8.6%, January blended lease-over-lease pricing was 4.2% and average daily occupancy was 95.7%. With new lease pricing moderating as expected, renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 is providing a catalyst for the strong January pricing and is expected to be strong for the next few months before moderating to a more typical range. We are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 8% to 9% for the first quarter. We do expect new supply in several of our markets remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth, but the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population household and job growth. As Eric mentioned, should we see a more dramatic downturn in the economy from here, we expect our market's diversification and price point will help mitigate some of the impact to performance. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the full year 2022, we completed more than 6,500 interior unit upgrades and installed over 24,000 smart home packages. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of smart units is over 71,000, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 11 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on costs averaging approximately 17%.We have another four projects that will begin repricing this quarter and five additional projects currently under construction. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Despite execution challenges in the transaction market, our team successfully completed our disposition plan for 2022 by closing our last two dispositions in the fourth quarter. Our total disposition proceeds for the year were approximately $325 million, representing a stabilized NOI yield of 4.3% and an investment IRR of 17.7% for assets with an average age of 25 years old. In 2023, we will continue the discipline of steadily recycling capital out of older, higher CapEx properties with the intent to redeploy the capital into newer, lower CapEx, higher rent growth properties to drive higher long-term earnings growth within our portfolio. While transaction volume continues to be muted, we believe it's likely that the transaction market will provide more opportunities towards the back half of the year. Currently, the number of marketed properties is down substantially from 2022, with the majority of sellers waiting until at least the spring leasing season before reevaluating their planned sale timing. In the face of this lower volume, we have seen some upward pressure on cap rates with the degree of the movement varying based on property characteristics, embedded rent growth, as well as market and submarket location. However, until closed transactions materially increase transparency around cap rates will be difficult. When marketed deal volume does increase, we expect buyer financial strength and speed of execution to be attractive key differentiators and our balance sheet strength and capacity will support our ability to transact despite a more difficult credit environment. On our new developments, our team has done a tremendous job working through the challenges of elevated construction costs and permitting delays, leading to steady growth in our development pipeline. During 2022,we started construction on 1,253 units at a cost of $468 million, a record level of starts for MAA.  During the fourth quarter, we started construction on two projects that have been in predevelopment for some time. These two projects will begin delivering units in two years and should finish construction in three years, lining up well with what we believe is likely to be a strong leasing environment. While the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and construction bidding processes, we expect to start four new developments during the back half of 2023. This includes two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary and supply chain pressures from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules. Despite these headwinds, the team delivered three projects on time in 2022 and under budget by approximately $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter, construction wrapped up on MAA Windmill Hill, and we reached stabilization at MAA Robinson, MAA West Glenn and MAA Park Point with operating results well ahead of our pro forma expectations delivering stabilized NOI yields on average of 6.6%. Leasing demand at our new properties remains high and the competition from other new supply has, to-date, not had a significant impact on our lease-up performance with rents being achieved well ahead of pro formas. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Al.\nAlbert Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.32 for the quarter was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and contributed to core FFO for the full year of $8.50 per share, representing a 21% increase over the prior year. Same-store rental pricing and occupancy levels were in line with expectations for the quarter, while higher fee and reimbursement revenues, combined with strong lease-up and commercial revenues, to produce about two-thirds of this earnings outperformance for the quarter. This favorability was partially offset by real estate tax expenses, as final millage rates came in higher than expected during the quarter for several markets, primarily in Texas. Our real estate tax estimates were based on strong valuations supported by the very strong revenue trends over the last year, offset by expected millage rate rollbacks as counties managed overall tax needs and rollbacks occurred but were less than expected in Texas, particularly in Dallas and Austin. Our internal guidance for \u2013 our initial guidance, excuse me, for '23, which we'll discuss more in a moment anticipate some continued pressure in this area given its backward-looking nature. Our balance sheet remains very strong, as we ended the year with historically low leverage debt-to-EBITDA RE of3.71 times with 95.5% of our debt fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with $1.3 billion available capacity to support growth and manage our debt maturities late in 2023. Also at the end of January, we settled our outstanding forward equity contracts, providing an additional $204 million of capacity at an attractive cost of capital. We currently expect to fund our near-term acquisition, development and refinancing needs with short-term debt capacity allowing the financing markets to continue to stabilize before locking in long-term financing. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2023 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.88 to $9.28 per share or $9.08 at the midpoint, which represents a 6.8% increase over the prior year. The foundation for the projected 2023 performance is same-store revenue growth produced by historically higher rental pricing earn-in of about 5.5% combined with the more normalized blended rental pricing performance of 3% for the year, as well as a continued strong occupancy remaining between 95.6% and 96%for the year. Based on this, effective rent growth for the year is projected to be a solid 7% at the midpoint of our range, with total same-store revenues expected to grow 6.25%, slightly diluted from the other revenue items, primarily reimbursement in fee income, which grew at a more modest pace. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at 6.15% at the midpoint for the year with real estate taxes and insurance producing the most significant growth pressure. Combined these two items alone are expected to grow just over 7% for 2023 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow around 5.5%. These expense pressures are offset by the continued strong revenue growth with NOI for the year projected to grow 6.3% at the midpoint. We're also expecting continued external growth, both through the acquisitions and development opportunities during the year with a combined $700 million full year planned investment. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, providing around $300 million of expected proceeds. We expect to fund the remaining capital needs for the year from internal cash flow and short-term variable rate borrowings, as we anticipate the financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next year, eventually providing better opportunities to lock in long-term debt rates. This does produce some slight pressure on current year FFO performance given high short-term rates, but is expected to be rewarded with lower long-term financing costs when markets stabilize further. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Nikki, we'll now turn the call back to you for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to start with the guidance on same-store revenue. So if you're at sort of right around 6% at the midpoint, I think you guys had an earn-in that was close to that number coming into the year. So, you have occupancy being roughly flat in the guidance. So just trying to understand kind of what might be the offset as to \u2013 and you are assuming some market rent growth, as well. So just trying to understand kind of the buildup there and if there is anything we're missing as to why the revenue growth guidance wouldn't be a little bit higher based on the earnings you've cited?\nAlbert Campbell: Yes. Nick, I'll give you the components \u2013 this is Al. I'll give you the components of how we built it, and maybe Tim can give a little color, if he would like, on some of the components. But really it\u2019s built on the earn-in. You talked about based on where pricing was when we think about earnings is pricing at the end the year if it were to carry-forward that same level, not up or down, what would it be built into our portfolio. That's about5.5%, that's the way we think about it. And on top of that, you get about half of the current year expected blended pricing. And as we talked about, we're expecting about 3%. So you add those two numbers together, you get right at the 7% effective rent growth guidance that we put out. Now that is, as we mentioned in the comments, a little bit moderated from other income items. About 10% of our revenue stream is from reimbursements and fees those things and they're expected to grow more modestly than that. So that's what gets to 6.25%, but in terms of the earn-in and the components, that's really what it is.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just the second question is just to get a feel for what type of economic scenario is baked into guidance whether this is a softer landing with modest job losses, any commentary from you guys on the economic outlook would be helpful? Thanks.\nEric Bolton: Well, Nick, this is Eric. I mean broadly, as Al mentioned, I mean, we do expect that the overall rent growth for the market next year will be something around 3%, which I think is going to be fueled by what we expect to be a continued relatively stable employment backdrop to what we're seeing today. We're not seeing any real evidence, significant evidence building in any of our markets at this point relating to employment weakness or people losing jobs. We're not having any kind of issues surrounding collections. Migration trends continue to be very positive.  And so, as we think about the outlook for '23, I mean, we're \u2013 it's definitely moderated from what it was 2022, but we're not seeing any concerns at the moment that a severe contraction or any sort of a worse \u2013 a materially worse decline in the employment markets were to occur now. If that does happen is, as I alluded to in my comments, we've been through recessions in the past, and we think that if we find ourselves in a more severe economic contraction, where broadly the employment markets start to really pull back, we think that that's where the sort of defensive characteristics that we've built into our strategy really start to pay a dividend for us and that's where our secondary markets come into play on lower price point of our product comes into play and the broad diversification to employment sectors that we have across the large number of markets that we're in, all provide some level of cushion, if you will, if we find ourselves in a more severe downturn. So right now, we're not calling for that, but we think that it should have happen, we would probably weather that pressure better than a lot of others.\nNick Yulico: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. Just, first question is on development and your appetite for using capital. You said that cap rates overall for stabilized products are still sort of in flux. The debt market is clearly better for apartments, but CMBS, which you guys don't use or Fannie, Freddie, whatever, that's still \u2013 well, I guess, more CMBS remains sort of closed.  So as you guys think about development, do you think more about starting on your own account or do you see the potential that you're better off buying from other people who may run into financial difficulty, where on a risk-adjusted, you're better off to pick from someone else rather than starting ground up from you guys?\nBrad Hill: Yes, Alex, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. I'd say it's both. We're looking at both opportunities, both on our balance sheet and then working with partners, as well. I mean what we haven't seen broadly yet are developers kind of spitting sites, spitting land sites. We've seen it a little bit, but it's been sites that we're not really interested in. We've not seen the well located sites that have gone under contract kind of being let go, we've not seen that yet. So we will keep our eye on that for sure, because I think that's where the opportunity presents itself for our on-balance sheet developments where we can pick up some of those land sites that other people drop. I think what we are seeing short term is exactly what you mentioned is the difficulties in the debt market kind of showing up through some of our development partners, maybe they can't get the debt financing for some of their developments going or equity partners backing out on deals. We are seeing that short term. We've got a team of folks this week that are out at NMHC and we've already got a number of e-mails of projects, JV development opportunities that are a follow-up from that, where their shovel-ready, could start mid-year.  So we'll begin evaluating those because I think those are the ones that are going to be impacted by the debt market and just how tight that is right now. But the long story is, we'll look for opportunities in both of those areas.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And the second question is just going back to Nick's question on sort of state of the markets and the employment. One of the common refrains about the Sunbelt is, it always has a lot of supply, but the economic growth seems to be more than offset and you spoke about that relative to your ability to manage higher taxes, higher insurance. As you look at this year, and based on what your property managers see among the resident base and employment stats within your markets, do you see any like substantial risk that employment or economic job growth in your markets will not be able to exceed the new supply coming on? Or as you sit here today, your \u2013 as you guys sit around the round table, you're like, there are a few more markets that we're more concerned about now than we were back in, let's say, November, when you guys were assessing how 2023 would look?\nEric Bolton: Well, Alex, this is Eric. As we sit here today, we continue to feel good about the demand side of the equation for us. As I mentioned, we're not seeing any \u2013 I mean, the lead volume and traffic that we're seeing is still strong. We are seeing \u2013 not seeing any evidence of stress with our renters in terms of collections.  We're not seeing any evidence of people coming in, talking about losing their job because of \u2013 and needing to get out their lease. We're not seeing any roommating trends starting to pick up. And so, as we sit here \u2013 and then also, you look at the migration trends, we still saw 12% of the leases that we did in the fourth quarter were for people moving into the Sunbelt from outside of Sunbelt.  So, we are still not seeing any worries build on the demand side of the equation at this point, moderating from what it was but still quite strong.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you. All good. Thank you.\nEric Bolton: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks guys. I was just curious if you could share how \u2013 I believe the 3% figure you provided on lease-over-leases, the blended lease rate growth assumption embedded in guidance. And I'm just wondering if you could breakdown that between sort of the first half assumption and back half, as you alluded to, kind of renewals maybe trending a little bit lower as the year progresses?\nTim Argo: Hey, Austin, this is Tim. Yes, you heard me mention in the comments that renewals right now are the catalyst for us and kind of carrying the strength, new lease pricing outpace renewals for the bulk of 2022. So we knew we kind of had some runway on the renewal side that's carrying us through this early part of 2023. So, the 8% to 9% I talked about on renewals, I think that probably carries through the first quarter, call it, and then starts to moderate a little bit as you get into probably, June through the rest of the year, I would expect it to be a little more normal with sort of what you've typically seen from MAA, which is kind of in that 6% to 7% range and then on the new lease side, we're sitting slightly negative right now.  I think that will slowly accelerate through the spring and summer and go modestly positive and then trend back down towards the end of the year. So, kind of higher renewals in the first half of the year, moderating a little bit, new lease rates growing slightly through the year and then moderating just with seasonality, as we typically would see in Q4 and then you kind of blend that all together and get to the forecast that we have for blended lease-over-lease.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Well, on the new lease rate side, I guess what specifically \u2013 I mean it seems like that's fairly low relative to what you've achieved historically, pre-pandemic period and with 3% market rent growth, you would think that you kind of surpass that 3% into the peak leasing season before it moderates in the back half of the year. So, I guess I'm trying to understand that kind of cautious new lease rate growth assumption in your guidance? And then, could you also just share what would get you to the low end of the guidance range because that seems like a pretty draconian scenario to be able to achieve the lower end? Thanks.\nAlbert Campbell: I'll give you sort of the forecast how it's laid out quarter by quarter, and Tim will give a little more specifics on it. It is fairly consistent around that 3% for the year with obviously more -- a little higher in the second two quarters of the year, as Tim mentioned, as we get more traffic and renewals hold stronger and new lease pricing becomes most robust. It's really going to come down to new lease pricing as the variable through the year. But the band is fairly tight around 3% in our expectation, just given the blend of over overall demand. And so...\nTim Argo: Yes, following up on the new lease rate, I mean, we again, absent last year that was record highs, new lease rates kind of November-December, early part of the first quarter, typically are negative. So it's not unusual kind of the new lease rates that we're seeing right now and then they start to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer. But in terms of getting to low end, I think it's kind of back to Eric's comments on the economy, if we see a further deceleration in demand or see something a shock on the economic front that could drive pricing obviously lower and that's how you get towards the lower end of the guidance and then the opposite a little bit better economic backdrop would push pricing higher and get us more to the higher end of revenue guidance.\nAlbert Campbell: If That shot came, it would -- given that it's coming -- the impact will come through pricing, it would be manifest probably in the latter part of the year as those new leases blended in.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. \nNick Joseph: Thanks. Eric, in your comments on the stuff, you talked about the strong balance sheet and have been in a position to capture any growth opportunities. It sounds like you think may emerge from your comments on the call, it sounds like maybe that's more of a second half '23 comment. But where do you think there's opportunities could come from? Is that more acquisitions, land, something else?\nEric Bolton: No, Nick, I would tell you that my belief is that we've been through this in the past, where we tend to find the best opportunity is in projects that are in lease-up, fairly newly constructed. There are more not have already finished the construction. They may be at that 50%-60% occupancy level in their initial lease-up. They've been leasing for probably the better part of the year. So they're still \u2013 they are now getting to a point where they're starting to run into lease expirations and related turnover, which just brings that much more pressure on the lease-up effort itself. And these, as I say, are not yet fully stabilized assets and thus, they're more difficult to finance from a typical leverage buyer so that's where we're hopeful that we will find more emerging opportunities in that kind of a scenario. We've certainly seen that in the past. And one of the things I think is important to point out, I mean, our assumptions is built around \u2013 for 2023, our guidance is built around the assumption of a $400 million acquisition volume. Now we are assuming that their initial yield on this $400 million of acquisition is only 3%, reflecting that non-stabilized status of these investments, so while that is weighing on FFO performance for the year, we think that it has great value proposition, value opportunity going forward long term. And so we're \u2013 given the supply that's coming into the market, given the difficult financing environment we find ourselves in, we think that, that area of opportunity is going to emerge over the course of this year, and that's what we've kind of dialed into our guidance for the year.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, we've spent a lot of time on kind of macro backdrop and the blended rent growth assumption and everything that goes into revenue. But if you think about from a market perspective in '23, given your kind of new guidance, what does that imply for which markets are kind of the top performers and which you're concerned about? \nTim Argo: Yes, Nick, this is Tim. I mean with the earned in, we talked about of our larger markets, I expect just rent growth or revenue growth should be pretty solid for several of our markets due to that earn-in. But if you think about some of the stronger ones that we think will continue into 2023, I mean, Orlando, continues to be a really strong market for us. It's been strong now for a couple of years. In terms of demand, it's our #1 job growth market that we're expecting for 2023. It is getting a little bit of supply, but it's not necessarily situated where our portfolio is in Orlando of some markets in our portfolio that are getting the most supply only one of those is in Orlando. So the demand, combined with the supply there expects Orlando to be strong. It's continued to have really strong blended pricing both in Q4 and January. And then Dallas is another one I'd point out that we think can show some strength in 2023. It's one of our lower supply markets we would expect. There is a couple submarkets that we're in, particularly in North Dallas, Frisco, Plano Allen, that will get some supply. But broadly, Dallas hasn't seen as much supply pressure, and we've seen the pricing both in Q4 and January been a little bit higher than portfolio average. So those are a couple that we've kind of got our eye on from a strength standpoint. Austin is probably one that on the downside that we're keeping our eye on more than anything. It's kind of got the extremes on supply and demand.  It's one of the better indicators in terms of demand with job growth, migration, population, all that, but it also has absolute high supply coming into the market of any of our portfolios or any of the markets in our portfolio out of the various submarkets that we're seeing supply, 4 out of the top 20 are in Austin. So that's one we do expect to moderate, though it does have pretty good earned in rate growth. So, those area couple that we're kind of keeping our eye on.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. So it sounds like maybe the large still outperformed the secondary markets in '23 or maybe that spread narrows a bit?\nTim Argo: Yes, it probably narrows a bit just with moderating rent growth. We typically see the secondary markets holdup a little more if we get into softer economic environment. But I think broadly in terms of revenue growth, again, with the earn-in, I would expect that the large markets hold up pretty well.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Thanks. Just a question on new lease spreads and pricing going into the spring. What would cause you to get a bit more, I guess, confident on pushing rate more as you get to the peak leasing season, would it be just general improvement and economic sentiment, job to be where it is, the market continuing to do well? Just curious how you may change your approach to pricing in spring if things get a bit better?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, generally, it's going to be \u2013 it will be that. It's the economy and the demand, and we look at lead volume, we look at exposure, we look at rent to income and various things there that drives some of our decisions on \u2013 we are always sort of balancing how much we want to push price versus occupancy. So there's nothing \u2013 there is no blinking red lights right now that would suggest that we see any sort of downturn. We're kind of we're kind of monitoring all those various metrics right now and everything looks about what you would typically think during this time of the year, during the winter. So it will really be as we get into spring and summer as demand picks up and traffic pick up and we pick up that will be really the determining factor on where 2023 heads in terms of demand.\nAnthony Powell: Okay, thanks. And turnover seemed pretty consistent. And any changes in how certain residents responded to lease renewals, price increases? And any trends there you want to call out?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean the turnover was \u2013 remains pretty low. Historically speaking, it was up a little bit in Q4, but the reasons for turn have been pretty consistent. We've actually seen the move-out to rent increase decline a little bit, but it's still \u2013 it's a job transfer and buy a house are still the two biggest factors, but those have certainly been down from what we've seen in the past. But no notable trends one way or the other.\nAnthony Powell: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next with Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nChandni Luthra: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you spend some time talking about the expense outlook for 2023, what would get you to the low end versus the high end? And guidance does talk about property taxes in there, but perhaps you could spend some time on other elements? And then, what are the markets where you see more tax pressures versus others? Thank you.\nAlbert Campbell: Chandni, this is Al. I'll start with that and then maybe Tim can give some color on some of that. I think the way to think about that as you go into 2023 is, we're continuing to see general inflationary pressures a bit in our expenses, but really taxes and insurance are the drivers of the main pressure. And as I mentioned in my comments, those two together are over 7% and so that's really -- and taxes are 35% of all operating expenses. So it's very meaningful. And then the other expenses together are about 5.5%. I think we're beginning to see some moderation in personnel, repair maintenance and those things. And I think you'll see that manifest, and Tim can talk about components of it, but as we move more into the back of the year, you'll see a little more of that manifest in those loan items. But taxes and insurance, there's a pressure point. What could take us higher or lower to our guidance on the overall, which is primarily going to be taxes and insurance, would be we don't have a lot of information yet on either 1 of those. Taxes, when you go into the year, notoriously, you don't have a lot, you're going off -- you have a good idea what you think valuations will be based on cap rate markets, but you're totally guessing on millage rates, and that has been very volatile in the last year-or-so as municipalities deal with their budget issues. So we think we \u2013 and we've got a few fights left over from last year. I mean we've got some things that we're going to fight hard, and we continue to. In Texas, we'll formally litigate half of our properties this year than we did last year, and some of those have not yet finished. And so \u2013 there are things like that, that can make you go higher or lower. We feel like we've got our best estimate in there right now, and that's the appropriate thing to do. And so overall, we'll see some moderation in the controllable expenses, but expense pressure driven by insurance and taxes.\nTim Argo: Yes, Chandni, I'll add to that. As Al mentioned, about 40% of our expenses are taxed at insurance, call it, around 7%. And then the other 60% around 5.5%. So if I had to just thinking in terms of absolute year-over-year growth, I sort of rank them, I would say insurance is probably the highest, R&M probably the second highest in real estate tax is the third. So hitting on R&M, it's really driven by inflationary pressures, not so much we expect to get really any worse in 2023 that kind of carry over earn-in, if you will, on some of the inflationary increases that we saw in 2022,we've seen HVAC up 16%, plumbing up 18%, appliances up 17%. So that's expected to drive the pressure on the R&M side, but we still remain on a per unit basis lower than the sector average. I do think personnel moderates from what we saw in 2022. I think we have some opportunity there. But -- and then the other smaller line items are fairly manageable. So it's really on a controllable, if you will, side it's R&M, we think is driving the bulk of the increase.\nChandni Luthra: Thank you for all that details. For my follow-up question, I just wanted to clarify or trying to understand how are you thinking about bad debt in 2023? What's embedded in your guidance if there is anything and how does that compare versus 2022? And then as you've obviously talked about supply being higher in 2023, how are you thinking about concessions? Are you seeing more concessions in your markets, in your properties? Any thoughts around that would be very helpful. Thank you. \nBrad Hill: I'll start with the bad debt. I mean I think in terms of what we have in our guidance, collection practices have come pretty much back to normal, not 100% maybe, but very close, I would say. something to say about that. But collections are very good. What we dialed in as close to historic normal, call it, 40 to 50 basis points delinquency, which is very low. And we have almost no collections coming from any government programs. We have the amount of our uncollected from history as it continues to decline. So we're in a very good position there. And so our forecast for the year reflects that. And so moderating or normalizing trends that we're putting our forecast really has collections about where they typically are in a normal environment.\nTim Argo: Yes. And, one, I'll add on the concession point, we're not seeing any significant increase in concessions at this point. It was 0.3% of rents overall in Q4, which is in line with what we saw in Q3. We are -- to the extent we're seeing them, it's still largely across the portfolio, more in some of the urban or downtown submarkets, which has seen more of the supply and seeing less concession usage on more suburban assets. But generally, no big change from what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. .\nChandni Luthra: Thank you for that. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. \nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Few questions from me on the external growth front. I was at National Multi-Housing, too, but heard that there is a \u2013 that buyers more institutional demand, but a shortage of sellers and products. But I guess I am curious if you would see an advantage to a selling more assets now is that perhaps the premium and perhaps be willing to sell a bit earlier in the year to capitalize on even if it doesn't mean to put a dilution as the way to redeploy in a more favorable acquisition market in the back half of the year? \nBrad Hill: Yes. Haendel, this is Brad. I'll take that. As we entered this year, our disposition plan is really big component of that, as you mentioned, is the ability to redeploy that capital. That's a big part of what we're looking to do. And so we're not looking to time the market. We do a very in-depth review of our disposition plans in the third, fourth quarter of the year to really identify what we're going to sell for the year. And we generally don't factor in what we think are going to be the market dynamics in terms of just maximizing value. We want to do that. But broadly speaking, what we're trying to do is really build a long-term earnings within the company that really supports our ability to pay a growing dividend over time. And so we think that's better done on a consistent basis where we're in a position to be able to sell assets, maximize our proceeds to the best we can and then redeploy that capital into external growth opportunities. So what we have in our forecast right now is a sale of 1 asset earlier in the year. And the reason for that is we're targeting a strong primary market that's in Charlotte where we think we can kind of maximize the proceeds given the fact that there aren't a lot of sellers out there right now in that specific market. And then we'll come out with our other assets later in the year when we think the debt markets will be a little bit settled down a little bit, spreads will be a little bit less volatile than where they are right now and frankly, where buyers can get a little bit more visibility on values. We think that that's the best direction for us in terms of our dispositions and our external growth plan.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's very helpful. I appreciate the color there. A follow-up maybe on the different side, but external growth related. We've seen a lot of mid and high four cap rate trades of late, but hearing the bid-ask spread that remains fairly wide, 10-ish from some folks, so curious kind of what you're hearing or seeing on the bid-ask spread? And how this plays out? What do you think the market clearing price is or what you'd be willing to pay to get some deals done here? Thanks.\nBrad Hill: Yes. It's hard to say. I mean there is just, as we looked at the market in the fourth quarter, honestly, in terms of the assets that we would be interested in buying and track, there was really only seven. So in the universe of us normally tracking 40 deals in a quarter to only have seven transact is a very, very small universe and we have seen cap rates move up. I would say, in the third quarter, they're around 4.5 on the projects that we looked at. In the fourth quarter, they were 4.75. We \u2013 but there is a spread, obviously, and it really depends on where the assets are located. We saw one in the fourth quarter that traded, call it, for 5.25, but generally, when you're getting into that cap rate range right now, we found that the quality of the asset or the location is not ideal and it's not generally a location that we're interested in. So for assets we're interested in, they're still in the 4.75 range. To your earlier point, I think part of the driver there is that there's just not a lot on the market. And I think as more volume to come to market, which we think will happen late second quarter and into the third quarter later this year, even as more properties come to market that those cap rates likely expand a bit. I mean the fact is interest rates are up substantially. Today, the debt rates are 5 to 5.5 and that's got to push cap rates up at some point, negative leverage is not something that we can maintain in perpetuity. But until you have a significant volume of assets coming to market, there's still going to be a number of aggressive buyers out there that are bidding hard at assets that are really setting a lower cap rate range. And then I would also say that a majority of what's selling right now continues to be loan assumptions. And so that kind of masks what true cap rates are out in the market, and we just need volume to really help us see that.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's really helpful, too, appreciate that. If I could squeeze in one more. I don't think I heard it, but did you guys share or can you share what your turnover assumption is for a full year '23? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Yes, Haendel, this is Tim. For now, we're expecting it to be pretty similar. I think some of the reasons that drove turnover this year probably moderate a little bit and maybe some of the other reasons go up a little bit. But in general, we're expecting similar turnover to what we saw in 2022. .\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Thanks. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. \nRichard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the expected deceleration of rent growth, obviously, in 2023, no one is surprised by that. But I'm wondering if you can sort of get into some more of the nitty-gritty detail of where you're landing, how much of it is proactive on your part? How much of is it reactive? Are you sensing fatigue from customers? Are you noticing occupancy moving around or turnover? I think you mentioned \u2013 Tim, I think you mentioned turnover uptick in the fourth quarter. Are there any things that you're reacting to that's causing you to pinpoint where you're headed for same-store revenue growth in 2023? Or are you just sort of protecting the downside given some of the uncertainty in the macro environment and being more proactive in your approach? \nEric Bolton: Well, Rich, this is Eric. Let me try to answer that. I think that at the ground level, I would say that we're not really seeing anything at this point that causes us to believe that we're looking at a much weaker demand environment over the coming year. I mean as I touched on earlier, I mean we're still seeing no evidence of distress with our vendor base. Our rent-to-income ratios remain very stable relative to where they have been. Collections performance has been very strong. We're not seeing any behavioral changes with roommating, things of that nature. We're not in the trends to migrate \u2013 migration trends continue to be quite positive. Move outs to non-MAA markets and our move outs out of the Sunbelt continue to be quite low. So I think more than anything for us, we're just trying to keep an eye on the broader economy and the broader employment markets and any evidence that the employers are really starting to get aggressive at downscaling and downsizing their staffing. And we've not seen that yet, but that would be obviously a cause for concern. But at a macro level, move-outs to home buying continues to be quite low, and there's no evidence mounting that that's starting to change and move outs due to the people not wanting to pay their rent increase that we're asking for, still is our third biggest reason. But we're still having people come in after them when they do move out, willing to pay more than what we were asking the renewing resident to pay. So that's a \u2013 that to me, is a fairly strong indicator that the market is still holding up quite well. And so, I think we're just \u2013 we're moderating off of incredible highs and that's what's happening here. But in terms of any significant pullback in demand, we are just not seeing that at this point.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. Second question is, just closing the loop on the supply conversation, what always happens is developers chasing 2022 growth by delivering product in 2024. Always a smart strategy. But I guess my question is, do you feel like the environment and interest rates and everything else, do you feel like sort of the private developer model is on shaker ground than normal this time around? And perhaps even more of an opportunity for you to step in at some point down the road? Or is it sort of a typical environment, different, obviously, variables, but a typical opportunity for you a year or two down the road?\nBrad Hill: Rich, this is Brad. I definitely think in terms of new starts, they're on much shaker ground, the privates are, for sure, in terms of getting financing. I would say that anything that is in lease-up right now. I mean there's not distress in that market currently. So there's not a lot of forced selling at the moment. Now there are still equity and capital folks that they want to cycle out of.  As I mentioned earlier, our region is predominantly controlled or developed by merchant developers and they're really \u2013 their model is built on developing an asset and selling it, taking the profit, moving on to the next deal and rinsing and repeating. I'd say that's a little bit in flux right now with nothing selling and the inability to start new assets. I would say the private developer is a little bit more in flux right now because of those reasons.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. \nWesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Last year, you had about just under $200 million of nonrecurring CapEx, how are you thinking about the spend for this year and is there anything in there that would drive down expenses maybe in 2023 or 2024?\nAlbert Campbell: Wes, this is Al. I'll start and frame the capital. I mean overall, we're spending -- all the programs to get her probably around $300 million in recurring and enhancing together probably $180 million. And so that's about$1,800 a unit, probably $1,000 recurring a little more and the rest being rent-enhancing. We continue our programs in redevelopment program, which includes our smart grant. So we'll do those interior programs that's another $97 million and we'll continue our property repositioning program with Tim talks about taking properties and increasing their revenue potential of another $20 million or so. So overall, it's about $300 million. I mean certainly, there's some There's certainly some things in the revenue has we think whether there'll be some ESG investments or some things like that, that will have some potential for the future. We're also seeing some inflationary pressures in that as well. And then a large portion of that fee is just investment for the future in some of those programs, repositioning program, redevelopment and smart rents. So that's kind of how we think about that.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then I guess as we maybe fast forward for the next few years, does this ever start to ramp down or do you have just a big pipeline of when the smart rent is done, you just move on to something else? How should we think about a multiyear view on this?\nTim Argo: Yes. Wes, this is Tim. I mean, in total, I think it comes down a little bit. The Smart Brent installation is a fairly significant piece of that. we expect to finish that capital project this year. I think you'll see that come down. But I would expect both on the unit interior redevelopment program and the broader sort of amenity-based property repositioning program that we expect to continue those at similar levels.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then did you comment on the exposure right now? I might have missed it?\nTim Argo: Exposure right now sit at about 7.5%, which is in line with what it was last year and kind of what we would typically expect this time of the year. .\nWesley Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot, everyone.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. \nRobert Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Brad, what are the markets represented by the four to six development starts over the next year plus? And given Tim's comments on R&M pressures, what are you seeing in terms of construction cost pressures going forward for new starts?\nBrad Hill: Yes, Rob. So for the four starts that we feel we're in good shape on for this year. We've got one in Charlotte, we've got one in Denver, we've got one in Orlando and one in Atlanta. I think I had those in my prepared comments. So those are projects we've been working on for a while and plans are in process on those. So we feel pretty good about those. In addition to those projects, we own a number of sites and we've got some in Denver, another phase in Orlando.  Second phase in the Raleigh market. So a number of those projects that would add up to that six over the next 18 months or so. But for this year, the 4 are the ones that I mentioned in my comments. In terms of construction costs, what we're seeing right now is that costs are not escalating like they were in 2022. We saw a significant increase in construction costs throughout the year. At this point, we're not seeing that at the moment. It's certainly our hope that as we get further into this year, the times where our developments will be starting second or third and fourth quarter that perhaps we get some relief there. The first signs of that are that we're getting calls from contractors saying they didn't think they had capacity to bid our job originally, but now they do. We're hearing that from subcontractors as well. So given where the single-family market is and the fact that we expect new supply starts to come down on multifamily, we hope to see some relief on the construction side but for now, it's just holding flat.\nRobert Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al, G&A was 58.8 in '22 and the guidance is 55.5 at the midpoint for '23. Obviously, Tom's left, but what else is in that expected decrease?\nAlbert Campbell: I think that's, well, let me start with Rob, as we talked about, we really look at overhead as a total. And so I would focus more on the 128.5 and then that's over 3% growth in total for the year, which we think is rise. But on that specific G&A line, the biggest item there is we had very strong performance in 2022.  So you've got certain programs that performance incentive programs that are max and then we said our guidance for next year is based on target. So that's a big part of that. And then on the property management expense line, the growth in that, that you see is really investments in, primarily in technology, both to strengthen our platform and to support the initiatives that were going on. So, and I answered both of those because I think that's both together a part of that overall overhead growth for the year, Rob.\nRobert Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. thanks for taking my question. What's the expected expense growth cadence during the year? Is that relatively flat or is that accelerating? And within that are you have a midyear renewal or insurance but easier compares in the back half, how does that reconcile? And then on real estate taxes, the midpoint of the guidance is 6.25%, but that would be lower than 6.5% last year.  So, just trying to understand the shape of the expenses through the year and also why the real estate taxes would be perhaps slightly down this year?\nAlbert Campbell: Okay. I'll try to answer that. This is Al. I think what you \u2013 the cadence for expenses, you should see the most pressure in probably Q1 and that's because you've got a continuation of sort of the inflationary levels that we saw in third and fourth quarter carrying sequentially over and comparing to Q1 last year with a lot of inflationary pressure wasn't yet built in. So the highest point would probably be Q1 and it will moderate down Q2 and Q3 to more level more that mid-single-digit range. So that's the main thing. In taxes, the 6.25%, I think we are \u2013 last year, what we saw in 2022 was looking back to a strong year, we saw millage rates come in that we thought would roll back more than they did. It surprised us a little bit in the fourth quarter as we talked about. And so that was \u2013 we ended the year a little higher than we expected in 2022. And I think as we move in 2023, we don't expect significant reprising key areas. Our \u2013 we got a pretty \u2013 we have a pretty good beat on what's revaluing this year, it's primarily Texas and part of Atlanta, parts of Georgia, there's primarily Atlanta, and so given what's revaluing and our expectations for millage rates, and we have a few of our cases from 2022 that we're litigating that are spilling over into 2023. And so we've got an estimate of what we think we'll win on that. We may be wrong, but we've got an estimate on that, included in that. So all that together gets us that that 6.25% range. And a lot of unknown in that right now, as we talked about, but we think where we stand, that's a very good estimate.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And sticking with you, Al. NOI growth has been strong, but property values haven't had the same magnitude of increase due to the rise in cap rate. So does that leave more opportunity for successful appeals maybe in '24 and beyond? Thanks.\nAlbert Campbell: Yeah, I think what we'd say is '23 is a year just that they're still looking back at very strong revenue. It's kind of backward-looking game, looking at the beginning of this year. Still looking at strong revenues for 2022 and a pretty stable cap rate environment has changed, but it's still fairly stable. So that's driving it. I do think your point, I think, is a very good point.  As we move into 2024 that they're looking back in a more normalized year, we would expect some moderation in taxes, primarily in Texas, Georgia, and Florida. We're seeing that in most pressure because there \u2013 it's going to be driven by a normalized top line to your point. So we would agree with that comment.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in \u201823\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead. \nJohn Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for keeping the call going. Al, maybe just a few quick follow-ups on the property tax conversation. Could you just give me a rough sense what percentage of the portfolio you already have a high degree of visibility for the increases this year?\nAlbert Campbell: Man, it's \u2013 what we have a high degree of visibility is pretty low other than we have a good beat on what we think the values are. Obviously, we know given the current cap rate environment is what they are. . And John, I mean, 70% to 75% of our tax exposure is from Texas, Florida and Georgia. So it's really going to come down to the millage rates. It's going to turn down to what municipalities need? What are they going to \u2013we expect to have continued strong valuations and probably millage rates rolling back again. Where that all ends up? It's hard to have precise visibility at this point. I mean I think we have consultants that help us. We have a lot of market knowledge. So it's based on \u2013 our estimates based on Texas Georgia and Florida, the key drivers of our expense. And that's \u2013 I wish we had more at this point, but I do think that our experience our history in the markets, our consultants give us a pretty good understanding at this point, as good as we can have until second quarter, John, we'll have more third quarter, we'll have not perfect, but very good knowledge, I would say.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay and I understand there's a range around all the estimates. But just curious, A1, what do you think a reasonable worst-case scenario is for property taxes this year?\nAlbert Campbell: That's kind of why we've been a little higher \u2013 I am sorry yes, that's a good question. That's why we put a little bit higher range or a wider range on that, John. You saw that we put seven at the top end of our \u2013 I think that's what we would say. I mean we're 6.25, it could go \u2013 you could have some things go either way. We're hopeful that we have some strong fights in these areas, but I think seven would be several things going against us that we didn't expect.\nJohn Pawlowski: Is 8, 9, 10, 0 probability if cities don't lower millage rates...\nAlbert Campbell: I mean 8, 9 or 10. I mean, given what's revaluing and given the shape of where things are, I think 8, 9, 10 is probably low probability I do think 0 too low end is low probably, I mean the we're looking back again to a very strong 2022. I'm going to use that to put a cap rate on. And so I think it's hard to see much reduction in expectation this year. But as we mentioned, John, as you move into 2024, it would be hard to not be able to argue that some of those because so we would expect what moderation that we see at the beginning 2024.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for keeping the call going. Just a broader general question about the regulatory backdrop. Again, I apologize if this has been asked, but again, just a lot of talk in several municipalities around additional rent control, even at the federal level you have the White House putting out guidelines. Just curious, your overall thoughts on this particular actually have any impact in the short, medium or long term. But if you kind of think maybe a lot of the suggestions are just things that may not impact you at all because it's all about just reading out the bad players in the industry?\nRobert Del Priore: Tayo, this is Rob. I'll take a shot at answering that. I think really like if you start at the federal level and the White House blueprint that they put out a couple of weeks ago, it really does seem to focus a lot on \u2013 more on the affordable housing component of it. And really almost using the agencies as part of the leverage there, as we look at our states in which we operate and the municipalities, there is some rent control pressure or proposals that come up from time to time, but really don't ever see them gain any traction.  So from a kind of a short, medium term, we don't really see anything as we're tracking legislation across the board that gives us any significant concern and still view it as really if affordable housing is the end goal, it's more of a supply-driven pressure that needs to be added to the system rather than focusing on rent control, which ultimately is a negative for both the owners and the residents.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: We will move next with Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nJamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I guess just a follow-up on question, I mean, do you, in any way, include handicap any kind of rent control risk in your guidance or your rent outlook?\nRobert DelPriore: We have not.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. And then, I appreciate all the color on so far in kind of markets. It sounds like things are still going pretty well. But I guess if you focus specifically on like Austin, Nashville, Raleigh, some of these big tech growth markets in recent years and probably market have more layoffs than others.  Can you provide any kind of anecdotal evidence of anything changing there, whether it's different types of people backfilling vacancies or move-outs or anything like that, just those kind of markets versus the rest of the portfolio would be helpful? Thank you.\nTim Argo: Hey, Jamie, this is Tim. I mean I think the ones you point out are right in terms of Austin, Nashville, Raleigh are the ones where we would have more tech exposure than some of the others. But as of now, we haven't seen it. I mean we're keeping an eye on what it exactly means in terms of which staff are going to be impacted by some of the announcements that have already been made, but to date, we haven't seen any impact from that.  No trends different in those markets other than sort of the broader we talked about Austin with broader supply/demand concerns, but we haven't seen anything yet, but those are the ones we would be keeping an eye on, for sure.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. Are you seeing slower demand from those types of employees, people in those industries?\nTim Argo: Not really. I mean, a lot of these markets aren't quite the Silicon Valley in terms of the types of employment that we had there. It's a little more call it, mid-level or if you want to say more a little more blue-collar-type tech, but we've not seen it yet. Like I said, it's some we're keeping an eye on, and that could be what drives more of the downside risk on our forecast for 2023, but nothing reportable so far.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thank you. \nOperator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. If you have any other thoughts or questions follow up, just reach out at any point. So, thank you for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2022 with fourth quarter results for core FFO that were ahead of expectations as higher fee income along with continued growth in average rent per unit and strong occupancy more than offset pressure from higher real estate taxes.  Looking ahead to the coming year, there is clearly some uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the employment markets, the pace of inflation and the broader economy. In addition, while we do know that new supply deliveries in 2023 broadly will be higher than in 2022, we continue to believe that MAA is well positioned for the coming year as the leasing market returns to more normalized conditions.  Our expectations for the coming year are built on a lease-over-lease pricing environment of 3%. This performance assumption, coupled with the earn-in from 2022's rent growth should drive growth in effective rent per unit of around 7% over the coming year. We will, of course, see conditions vary some by market and submarket location, but we believe that our portfolio is in a uniquely solid position to weather expected moderation from the historically high rate growth of last year.  This view is really supported by three key variables: first, we continue to believe that our Sunbelt footprint maintains an advantageous position for capturing demand, given the stronger and more stable employment markets in the Sunbelt states. We continue to see job growth, positive migration trends, affordable rent-to-income ratios and low resident turnover.  Secondly, MAA's unique diversification across the Sunbelt region, including both large and high-growth secondary markets, provides exposure to a good range of employment sectors and works to help soften some of the pressures surrounding new supply levels in a number of our larger markets. And thirdly, with a rent price point average for our portfolio that appeals to our broad segment of the rental market and it is around 20% below the price point of the mostly high-end new product being delivered, we believe we will capture more stability and top-line performance as leasing conditions normalize in 2023. In the event that we do find ourselves later in the year headed towards a more severe contraction in the economy or a recession, as MAA has consistently demonstrated over the past 20 years, we expect to perform with a lower level of volatility than what generally is seen with more concentrated portfolios and/or those costs traded in large coastal markets. The transaction market remains very quiet and we are likewise remaining patient with what opportunities we do see. I expect it will be the second half of the year before pricing data becomes more readily available. We do have plans to initiate development on four new projects in 2023 associated with sites that we already own or that are under our control. These projects will, of course, not actually start delivering units for another couple of years. In conclusion, I want to give a big thank you to our MAA associates for their tremendous service and record performance in2022.  We have the company well positioned for the next cycle, as a number of new tech initiatives will positively impact performance over the coming years. Our external growth pipeline continues to expand and the balance sheet provides a good, strong foundation for supporting our current portfolio operations, as well as active pursuit of new growth opportunities. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll turn the call over to Tim. Well, Nick, this is Eric. I mean broadly, as Al mentioned, I mean, we do expect that the overall rent growth for the market next year will be something around 3%, which I think is going to be fueled by what we expect to be a continued relatively stable employment backdrop to what we're seeing today. We're not seeing any real evidence, significant evidence building in any of our markets at this point relating to employment weakness or people losing jobs. We're not having any kind of issues surrounding collections. Migration trends continue to be very positive.  And so, as we think about the outlook for '23, I mean, we're \u2013 it's definitely moderated from what it was 2022, but we're not seeing any concerns at the moment that a severe contraction or any sort of a worse \u2013 a materially worse decline in the employment markets were to occur now. If that does happen is, as I alluded to in my comments, we've been through recessions in the past, and we think that if we find ourselves in a more severe economic contraction, where broadly the employment markets start to really pull back, we think that that's where the sort of defensive characteristics that we've built into our strategy really start to pay a dividend for us and that's where our secondary markets come into play on lower price point of our product comes into play and the broad diversification to employment sectors that we have across the large number of markets that we're in, all provide some level of cushion, if you will, if we find ourselves in a more severe downturn. So right now, we're not calling for that, but we think that it should have happen, we would probably weather that pressure better than a lot of others. Well, Alex, this is Eric. As we sit here today, we continue to feel good about the demand side of the equation for us. As I mentioned, we're not seeing any \u2013 I mean, the lead volume and traffic that we're seeing is still strong. We are seeing \u2013 not seeing any evidence of stress with our renters in terms of collections.  We're not seeing any evidence of people coming in, talking about losing their job because of \u2013 and needing to get out their lease. We're not seeing any roommating trends starting to pick up. And so, as we sit here \u2013 and then also, you look at the migration trends, we still saw 12% of the leases that we did in the fourth quarter were for people moving into the Sunbelt from outside of Sunbelt.  So, we are still not seeing any worries build on the demand side of the equation at this point, moderating from what it was but still quite strong. Okay. Thank you. No, Nick, I would tell you that my belief is that we've been through this in the past, where we tend to find the best opportunity is in projects that are in lease-up, fairly newly constructed. There are more not have already finished the construction. They may be at that 50%-60% occupancy level in their initial lease-up. They've been leasing for probably the better part of the year. So they're still \u2013 they are now getting to a point where they're starting to run into lease expirations and related turnover, which just brings that much more pressure on the lease-up effort itself. And these, as I say, are not yet fully stabilized assets and thus, they're more difficult to finance from a typical leverage buyer so that's where we're hopeful that we will find more emerging opportunities in that kind of a scenario. We've certainly seen that in the past. And one of the things I think is important to point out, I mean, our assumptions is built around \u2013 for 2023, our guidance is built around the assumption of a $400 million acquisition volume. Now we are assuming that their initial yield on this $400 million of acquisition is only 3%, reflecting that non-stabilized status of these investments, so while that is weighing on FFO performance for the year, we think that it has great value proposition, value opportunity going forward long term. And so we're \u2013 given the supply that's coming into the market, given the difficult financing environment we find ourselves in, we think that, that area of opportunity is going to emerge over the course of this year, and that's what we've kind of dialed into our guidance for the year. Well, Rich, this is Eric. Let me try to answer that. I think that at the ground level, I would say that we're not really seeing anything at this point that causes us to believe that we're looking at a much weaker demand environment over the coming year. I mean as I touched on earlier, I mean we're still seeing no evidence of distress with our vendor base. Our rent-to-income ratios remain very stable relative to where they have been. Collections performance has been very strong. We're not seeing any behavioral changes with roommating, things of that nature. We're not in the trends to migrate \u2013 migration trends continue to be quite positive. Move outs to non-MAA markets and our move outs out of the Sunbelt continue to be quite low. So I think more than anything for us, we're just trying to keep an eye on the broader economy and the broader employment markets and any evidence that the employers are really starting to get aggressive at downscaling and downsizing their staffing. And we've not seen that yet, but that would be obviously a cause for concern. But at a macro level, move-outs to home buying continues to be quite low, and there's no evidence mounting that that's starting to change and move outs due to the people not wanting to pay their rent increase that we're asking for, still is our third biggest reason. But we're still having people come in after them when they do move out, willing to pay more than what we were asking the renewing resident to pay. So that's a \u2013 that to me, is a fairly strong indicator that the market is still holding up quite well. And so, I think we're just \u2013 we're moderating off of incredible highs and that's what's happening here. But in terms of any significant pullback in demand, we are just not seeing that at this point. Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. If you have any other thoughts or questions follow up, just reach out at any point. So, thank you for joining us."

Despite execution challenges in the transaction market, our team successfully completed our disposition plan for 2022 by closing our last two dispositions in the fourth quarter. Our total disposition proceeds for the year were approximately $325 million, representing a stabilized NOI yield of 4.3% and an investment IRR of 17.7% for assets with an average age of 25 years old. In 2023, we will continue the discipline of steadily recycling capital out of older, higher CapEx properties with the intent to redeploy the capital into newer, lower CapEx, higher rent growth properties to drive higher long-term earnings growth within our portfolio. While transaction volume continues to be muted, we believe it's likely that the transaction market will provide more opportunities towards the back half of the year. Currently, the number of marketed properties is down substantially from 2022, with the majority of sellers waiting until at least the spring leasing season before reevaluating their planned sale timing. In the face of this lower volume, we have seen some upward pressure on cap rates with the degree of the movement varying based on property characteristics, embedded rent growth, as well as market and submarket location. However, until closed transactions materially increase transparency around cap rates will be difficult. When marketed deal volume does increase, we expect buyer financial strength and speed of execution to be attractive key differentiators and our balance sheet strength and capacity will support our ability to transact despite a more difficult credit environment. On our new developments, our team has done a tremendous job working through the challenges of elevated construction costs and permitting delays, leading to steady growth in our development pipeline. During 2022,we started construction on 1,253 units at a cost of $468 million, a record level of starts for MAA.  During the fourth quarter, we started construction on two projects that have been in predevelopment for some time. These two projects will begin delivering units in two years and should finish construction in three years, lining up well with what we believe is likely to be a strong leasing environment. While the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and construction bidding processes, we expect to start four new developments during the back half of 2023. This includes two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary and supply chain pressures from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules. Despite these headwinds, the team delivered three projects on time in 2022 and under budget by approximately $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter, construction wrapped up on MAA Windmill Hill, and we reached stabilization at MAA Robinson, MAA West Glenn and MAA Park Point with operating results well ahead of our pro forma expectations delivering stabilized NOI yields on average of 6.6%. Leasing demand at our new properties remains high and the competition from other new supply has, to-date, not had a significant impact on our lease-up performance with rents being achieved well ahead of pro formas. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Al. Yes, Alex, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. I'd say it's both. We're looking at both opportunities, both on our balance sheet and then working with partners, as well. I mean what we haven't seen broadly yet are developers kind of spitting sites, spitting land sites. We've seen it a little bit, but it's been sites that we're not really interested in. We've not seen the well located sites that have gone under contract kind of being let go, we've not seen that yet. So we will keep our eye on that for sure, because I think that's where the opportunity presents itself for our on-balance sheet developments where we can pick up some of those land sites that other people drop. I think what we are seeing short term is exactly what you mentioned is the difficulties in the debt market kind of showing up through some of our development partners, maybe they can't get the debt financing for some of their developments going or equity partners backing out on deals. We are seeing that short term. We've got a team of folks this week that are out at NMHC and we've already got a number of e-mails of projects, JV development opportunities that are a follow-up from that, where their shovel-ready, could start mid-year.  So we'll begin evaluating those because I think those are the ones that are going to be impacted by the debt market and just how tight that is right now. But the long story is, we'll look for opportunities in both of those areas. I'll start with the bad debt. I mean I think in terms of what we have in our guidance, collection practices have come pretty much back to normal, not 100% maybe, but very close, I would say. something to say about that. But collections are very good. What we dialed in as close to historic normal, call it, 40 to 50 basis points delinquency, which is very low. And we have almost no collections coming from any government programs. We have the amount of our uncollected from history as it continues to decline. So we're in a very good position there. And so our forecast for the year reflects that. And so moderating or normalizing trends that we're putting our forecast really has collections about where they typically are in a normal environment. Yes. Haendel, this is Brad. I'll take that. As we entered this year, our disposition plan is really big component of that, as you mentioned, is the ability to redeploy that capital. That's a big part of what we're looking to do. And so we're not looking to time the market. We do a very in-depth review of our disposition plans in the third, fourth quarter of the year to really identify what we're going to sell for the year. And we generally don't factor in what we think are going to be the market dynamics in terms of just maximizing value. We want to do that. But broadly speaking, what we're trying to do is really build a long-term earnings within the company that really supports our ability to pay a growing dividend over time. And so we think that's better done on a consistent basis where we're in a position to be able to sell assets, maximize our proceeds to the best we can and then redeploy that capital into external growth opportunities. So what we have in our forecast right now is a sale of 1 asset earlier in the year. And the reason for that is we're targeting a strong primary market that's in Charlotte where we think we can kind of maximize the proceeds given the fact that there aren't a lot of sellers out there right now in that specific market. And then we'll come out with our other assets later in the year when we think the debt markets will be a little bit settled down a little bit, spreads will be a little bit less volatile than where they are right now and frankly, where buyers can get a little bit more visibility on values. We think that that's the best direction for us in terms of our dispositions and our external growth plan. Yes. It's hard to say. I mean there is just, as we looked at the market in the fourth quarter, honestly, in terms of the assets that we would be interested in buying and track, there was really only seven. So in the universe of us normally tracking 40 deals in a quarter to only have seven transact is a very, very small universe and we have seen cap rates move up. I would say, in the third quarter, they're around 4.5 on the projects that we looked at. In the fourth quarter, they were 4.75. We \u2013 but there is a spread, obviously, and it really depends on where the assets are located. We saw one in the fourth quarter that traded, call it, for 5.25, but generally, when you're getting into that cap rate range right now, we found that the quality of the asset or the location is not ideal and it's not generally a location that we're interested in. So for assets we're interested in, they're still in the 4.75 range. To your earlier point, I think part of the driver there is that there's just not a lot on the market. And I think as more volume to come to market, which we think will happen late second quarter and into the third quarter later this year, even as more properties come to market that those cap rates likely expand a bit. I mean the fact is interest rates are up substantially. Today, the debt rates are 5 to 5.5 and that's got to push cap rates up at some point, negative leverage is not something that we can maintain in perpetuity. But until you have a significant volume of assets coming to market, there's still going to be a number of aggressive buyers out there that are bidding hard at assets that are really setting a lower cap rate range. And then I would also say that a majority of what's selling right now continues to be loan assumptions. And so that kind of masks what true cap rates are out in the market, and we just need volume to really help us see that. Rich, this is Brad. I definitely think in terms of new starts, they're on much shaker ground, the privates are, for sure, in terms of getting financing. I would say that anything that is in lease-up right now. I mean there's not distress in that market currently. So there's not a lot of forced selling at the moment. Now there are still equity and capital folks that they want to cycle out of.  As I mentioned earlier, our region is predominantly controlled or developed by merchant developers and they're really \u2013 their model is built on developing an asset and selling it, taking the profit, moving on to the next deal and rinsing and repeating. I'd say that's a little bit in flux right now with nothing selling and the inability to start new assets. I would say the private developer is a little bit more in flux right now because of those reasons. Yes, Rob. So for the four starts that we feel we're in good shape on for this year. We've got one in Charlotte, we've got one in Denver, we've got one in Orlando and one in Atlanta. I think I had those in my prepared comments. So those are projects we've been working on for a while and plans are in process on those. So we feel pretty good about those. In addition to those projects, we own a number of sites and we've got some in Denver, another phase in Orlando.  Second phase in the Raleigh market. So a number of those projects that would add up to that six over the next 18 months or so. But for this year, the 4 are the ones that I mentioned in my comments. In terms of construction costs, what we're seeing right now is that costs are not escalating like they were in 2022. We saw a significant increase in construction costs throughout the year. At this point, we're not seeing that at the moment. It's certainly our hope that as we get further into this year, the times where our developments will be starting second or third and fourth quarter that perhaps we get some relief there. The first signs of that are that we're getting calls from contractors saying they didn't think they had capacity to bid our job originally, but now they do. We're hearing that from subcontractors as well. So given where the single-family market is and the fact that we expect new supply starts to come down on multifamily, we hope to see some relief on the construction side but for now, it's just holding flat."

I think really like if you start at the federal level and the White House blueprint that they put out a couple of weeks ago, it really does seem to focus a lot on \u2013 more on the affordable housing component of it. And really almost using the agencies as part of the leverage there, as we look at our states in which we operate and the municipalities, there is some rent control pressure or proposals that come up from time to time, but really don't ever see them gain any traction.  So from a kind of a short, medium term, we don't really see anything as we're tracking legislation across the board that gives us any significant concern and still view it as really if affordable housing is the end goal, it's more of a supply-driven pressure that needs to be added to the system rather than focusing on rent control, which ultimately is a negative for both the owners and the residents. We have not."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. While pricing performance moderated during the fourth quarter from the record growth we had achieved September year-to-date, blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 5.7%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the fourth quarter was 14.9%, versus the prior year and 2.0% sequentially from the prior quarter. Full year 2022 blended lease-over-lease pricing was 13.9%, helping to drive full year effective rent growth of 14.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.6% for the fourth quarter and 95.7% for the full year 2022. In line with normal seasonality, our January new lease rate of negative 0.3% improved from December's new lease rate of negative 0.9% and other than 2022 represents a higher new lease rate than any year since we have been tracking the data. Combined with renewal pricing of 8.6%, January blended lease-over-lease pricing was 4.2% and average daily occupancy was 95.7%. With new lease pricing moderating as expected, renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 is providing a catalyst for the strong January pricing and is expected to be strong for the next few months before moderating to a more typical range. We are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 8% to 9% for the first quarter. We do expect new supply in several of our markets remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth, but the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population household and job growth. As Eric mentioned, should we see a more dramatic downturn in the economy from here, we expect our market's diversification and price point will help mitigate some of the impact to performance. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the full year 2022, we completed more than 6,500 interior unit upgrades and installed over 24,000 smart home packages. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of smart units is over 71,000, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 11 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on costs averaging approximately 17%.We have another four projects that will begin repricing this quarter and five additional projects currently under construction. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad. Hey, Austin, this is Tim. Yes, you heard me mention in the comments that renewals right now are the catalyst for us and kind of carrying the strength, new lease pricing outpace renewals for the bulk of 2022. So we knew we kind of had some runway on the renewal side that's carrying us through this early part of 2023. So, the 8% to 9% I talked about on renewals, I think that probably carries through the first quarter, call it, and then starts to moderate a little bit as you get into probably, June through the rest of the year, I would expect it to be a little more normal with sort of what you've typically seen from MAA, which is kind of in that 6% to 7% range and then on the new lease side, we're sitting slightly negative right now.  I think that will slowly accelerate through the spring and summer and go modestly positive and then trend back down towards the end of the year. So, kind of higher renewals in the first half of the year, moderating a little bit, new lease rates growing slightly through the year and then moderating just with seasonality, as we typically would see in Q4 and then you kind of blend that all together and get to the forecast that we have for blended lease-over-lease. Yes, following up on the new lease rate, I mean, we again, absent last year that was record highs, new lease rates kind of November-December, early part of the first quarter, typically are negative. So it's not unusual kind of the new lease rates that we're seeing right now and then they start to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer. But in terms of getting to low end, I think it's kind of back to Eric's comments on the economy, if we see a further deceleration in demand or see something a shock on the economic front that could drive pricing obviously lower and that's how you get towards the lower end of the guidance and then the opposite a little bit better economic backdrop would push pricing higher and get us more to the higher end of revenue guidance. Yes, Nick, this is Tim. I mean with the earned in, we talked about of our larger markets, I expect just rent growth or revenue growth should be pretty solid for several of our markets due to that earn-in. But if you think about some of the stronger ones that we think will continue into 2023, I mean, Orlando, continues to be a really strong market for us. It's been strong now for a couple of years. In terms of demand, it's our #1 job growth market that we're expecting for 2023. It is getting a little bit of supply, but it's not necessarily situated where our portfolio is in Orlando of some markets in our portfolio that are getting the most supply only one of those is in Orlando. So the demand, combined with the supply there expects Orlando to be strong. It's continued to have really strong blended pricing both in Q4 and January. And then Dallas is another one I'd point out that we think can show some strength in 2023. It's one of our lower supply markets we would expect. There is a couple submarkets that we're in, particularly in North Dallas, Frisco, Plano Allen, that will get some supply. But broadly, Dallas hasn't seen as much supply pressure, and we've seen the pricing both in Q4 and January been a little bit higher than portfolio average. So those are a couple that we've kind of got our eye on from a strength standpoint. Austin is probably one that on the downside that we're keeping our eye on more than anything. It's kind of got the extremes on supply and demand.  It's one of the better indicators in terms of demand with job growth, migration, population, all that, but it also has absolute high supply coming into the market of any of our portfolios or any of the markets in our portfolio out of the various submarkets that we're seeing supply, 4 out of the top 20 are in Austin. So that's one we do expect to moderate, though it does have pretty good earned in rate growth. So, those area couple that we're kind of keeping our eye on. Yes, it probably narrows a bit just with moderating rent growth. We typically see the secondary markets holdup a little more if we get into softer economic environment. But I think broadly in terms of revenue growth, again, with the earn-in, I would expect that the large markets hold up pretty well. Yes. I mean, generally, it's going to be \u2013 it will be that. It's the economy and the demand, and we look at lead volume, we look at exposure, we look at rent to income and various things there that drives some of our decisions on \u2013 we are always sort of balancing how much we want to push price versus occupancy. So there's nothing \u2013 there is no blinking red lights right now that would suggest that we see any sort of downturn. We're kind of we're kind of monitoring all those various metrics right now and everything looks about what you would typically think during this time of the year, during the winter. So it will really be as we get into spring and summer as demand picks up and traffic pick up and we pick up that will be really the determining factor on where 2023 heads in terms of demand. Yes. I mean the turnover was \u2013 remains pretty low. Historically speaking, it was up a little bit in Q4, but the reasons for turn have been pretty consistent. We've actually seen the move-out to rent increase decline a little bit, but it's still \u2013 it's a job transfer and buy a house are still the two biggest factors, but those have certainly been down from what we've seen in the past. But no notable trends one way or the other. Yes, Chandni, I'll add to that. As Al mentioned, about 40% of our expenses are taxed at insurance, call it, around 7%. And then the other 60% around 5.5%. So if I had to just thinking in terms of absolute year-over-year growth, I sort of rank them, I would say insurance is probably the highest, R&M probably the second highest in real estate tax is the third. So hitting on R&M, it's really driven by inflationary pressures, not so much we expect to get really any worse in 2023 that kind of carry over earn-in, if you will, on some of the inflationary increases that we saw in 2022,we've seen HVAC up 16%, plumbing up 18%, appliances up 17%. So that's expected to drive the pressure on the R&M side, but we still remain on a per unit basis lower than the sector average. I do think personnel moderates from what we saw in 2022. I think we have some opportunity there. But -- and then the other smaller line items are fairly manageable. So it's really on a controllable, if you will, side it's R&M, we think is driving the bulk of the increase. Yes. And, one, I'll add on the concession point, we're not seeing any significant increase in concessions at this point. It was 0.3% of rents overall in Q4, which is in line with what we saw in Q3. We are -- to the extent we're seeing them, it's still largely across the portfolio, more in some of the urban or downtown submarkets, which has seen more of the supply and seeing less concession usage on more suburban assets. But generally, no big change from what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. . Yes, Haendel, this is Tim. For now, we're expecting it to be pretty similar. I think some of the reasons that drove turnover this year probably moderate a little bit and maybe some of the other reasons go up a little bit. But in general, we're expecting similar turnover to what we saw in 2022. . Yes. Wes, this is Tim. I mean, in total, I think it comes down a little bit. The Smart Brent installation is a fairly significant piece of that. we expect to finish that capital project this year. I think you'll see that come down. But I would expect both on the unit interior redevelopment program and the broader sort of amenity-based property repositioning program that we expect to continue those at similar levels. Exposure right now sit at about 7.5%, which is in line with what it was last year and kind of what we would typically expect this time of the year. . Hey, Jamie, this is Tim. I mean I think the ones you point out are right in terms of Austin, Nashville, Raleigh are the ones where we would have more tech exposure than some of the others. But as of now, we haven't seen it. I mean we're keeping an eye on what it exactly means in terms of which staff are going to be impacted by some of the announcements that have already been made, but to date, we haven't seen any impact from that.  No trends different in those markets other than sort of the broader we talked about Austin with broader supply/demand concerns, but we haven't seen anything yet, but those are the ones we would be keeping an eye on, for sure. Not really. I mean, a lot of these markets aren't quite the Silicon Valley in terms of the types of employment that we had there. It's a little more call it, mid-level or if you want to say more a little more blue-collar-type tech, but we've not seen it yet. Like I said, it's some we're keeping an eye on, and that could be what drives more of the downside risk on our forecast for 2023, but nothing reportable so far."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.32 for the quarter was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and contributed to core FFO for the full year of $8.50 per share, representing a 21% increase over the prior year. Same-store rental pricing and occupancy levels were in line with expectations for the quarter, while higher fee and reimbursement revenues, combined with strong lease-up and commercial revenues, to produce about two-thirds of this earnings outperformance for the quarter. This favorability was partially offset by real estate tax expenses, as final millage rates came in higher than expected during the quarter for several markets, primarily in Texas. Our real estate tax estimates were based on strong valuations supported by the very strong revenue trends over the last year, offset by expected millage rate rollbacks as counties managed overall tax needs and rollbacks occurred but were less than expected in Texas, particularly in Dallas and Austin. Our internal guidance for \u2013 our initial guidance, excuse me, for '23, which we'll discuss more in a moment anticipate some continued pressure in this area given its backward-looking nature. Our balance sheet remains very strong, as we ended the year with historically low leverage debt-to-EBITDA RE of3.71 times with 95.5% of our debt fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with $1.3 billion available capacity to support growth and manage our debt maturities late in 2023. Also at the end of January, we settled our outstanding forward equity contracts, providing an additional $204 million of capacity at an attractive cost of capital. We currently expect to fund our near-term acquisition, development and refinancing needs with short-term debt capacity allowing the financing markets to continue to stabilize before locking in long-term financing. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2023 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.88 to $9.28 per share or $9.08 at the midpoint, which represents a 6.8% increase over the prior year. The foundation for the projected 2023 performance is same-store revenue growth produced by historically higher rental pricing earn-in of about 5.5% combined with the more normalized blended rental pricing performance of 3% for the year, as well as a continued strong occupancy remaining between 95.6% and 96%for the year. Based on this, effective rent growth for the year is projected to be a solid 7% at the midpoint of our range, with total same-store revenues expected to grow 6.25%, slightly diluted from the other revenue items, primarily reimbursement in fee income, which grew at a more modest pace. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at 6.15% at the midpoint for the year with real estate taxes and insurance producing the most significant growth pressure. Combined these two items alone are expected to grow just over 7% for 2023 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow around 5.5%. These expense pressures are offset by the continued strong revenue growth with NOI for the year projected to grow 6.3% at the midpoint. We're also expecting continued external growth, both through the acquisitions and development opportunities during the year with a combined $700 million full year planned investment. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, providing around $300 million of expected proceeds. We expect to fund the remaining capital needs for the year from internal cash flow and short-term variable rate borrowings, as we anticipate the financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next year, eventually providing better opportunities to lock in long-term debt rates. This does produce some slight pressure on current year FFO performance given high short-term rates, but is expected to be rewarded with lower long-term financing costs when markets stabilize further. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Nikki, we'll now turn the call back to you for any questions. Yes. Nick, I'll give you the components \u2013 this is Al. I'll give you the components of how we built it, and maybe Tim can give a little color, if he would like, on some of the components. But really it's built on the earn-in. You talked about based on where pricing was when we think about earnings is pricing at the end the year if it were to carry-forward that same level, not up or down, what would it be built into our portfolio. That's about5.5%, that's the way we think about it. And on top of that, you get about half of the current year expected blended pricing. And as we talked about, we're expecting about 3%. So you add those two numbers together, you get right at the 7% effective rent growth guidance that we put out. Now that is, as we mentioned in the comments, a little bit moderated from other income items. About 10% of our revenue stream is from reimbursements and fees those things and they're expected to grow more modestly than that. So that's what gets to 6.25%, but in terms of the earn-in and the components, that's really what it is. I'll give you sort of the forecast how it's laid out quarter by quarter, and Tim will give a little more specifics on it. It is fairly consistent around that 3% for the year with obviously more -- a little higher in the second two quarters of the year, as Tim mentioned, as we get more traffic and renewals hold stronger and new lease pricing becomes most robust. It's really going to come down to new lease pricing as the variable through the year. But the band is fairly tight around 3% in our expectation, just given the blend of over overall demand. And so... If That shot came, it would -- given that it's coming -- the impact will come through pricing, it would be manifest probably in the latter part of the year as those new leases blended in. Chandni, this is Al. I'll start with that and then maybe Tim can give some color on some of that. I think the way to think about that as you go into 2023 is, we're continuing to see general inflationary pressures a bit in our expenses, but really taxes and insurance are the drivers of the main pressure. And as I mentioned in my comments, those two together are over 7% and so that's really -- and taxes are 35% of all operating expenses. So it's very meaningful. And then the other expenses together are about 5.5%. I think we're beginning to see some moderation in personnel, repair maintenance and those things. And I think you'll see that manifest, and Tim can talk about components of it, but as we move more into the back of the year, you'll see a little more of that manifest in those loan items. But taxes and insurance, there's a pressure point. What could take us higher or lower to our guidance on the overall, which is primarily going to be taxes and insurance, would be we don't have a lot of information yet on either 1 of those. Taxes, when you go into the year, notoriously, you don't have a lot, you're going off -- you have a good idea what you think valuations will be based on cap rate markets, but you're totally guessing on millage rates, and that has been very volatile in the last year-or-so as municipalities deal with their budget issues. So we think we \u2013 and we've got a few fights left over from last year. I mean we've got some things that we're going to fight hard, and we continue to. In Texas, we'll formally litigate half of our properties this year than we did last year, and some of those have not yet finished. And so \u2013 there are things like that, that can make you go higher or lower. We feel like we've got our best estimate in there right now, and that's the appropriate thing to do. And so overall, we'll see some moderation in the controllable expenses, but expense pressure driven by insurance and taxes. Wes, this is Al. I'll start and frame the capital. I mean overall, we're spending -- all the programs to get her probably around $300 million in recurring and enhancing together probably $180 million. And so that's about$1,800 a unit, probably $1,000 recurring a little more and the rest being rent-enhancing. We continue our programs in redevelopment program, which includes our smart grant. So we'll do those interior programs that's another $97 million and we'll continue our property repositioning program with Tim talks about taking properties and increasing their revenue potential of another $20 million or so. So overall, it's about $300 million. I mean certainly, there's some There's certainly some things in the revenue has we think whether there'll be some ESG investments or some things like that, that will have some potential for the future. We're also seeing some inflationary pressures in that as well. And then a large portion of that fee is just investment for the future in some of those programs, repositioning program, redevelopment and smart rents. So that's kind of how we think about that. I think that's, well, let me start with Rob, as we talked about, we really look at overhead as a total. And so I would focus more on the 128.5 and then that's over 3% growth in total for the year, which we think is rise. But on that specific G&A line, the biggest item there is we had very strong performance in 2022.  So you've got certain programs that performance incentive programs that are max and then we said our guidance for next year is based on target. So that's a big part of that. And then on the property management expense line, the growth in that, that you see is really investments in, primarily in technology, both to strengthen our platform and to support the initiatives that were going on. So, and I answered both of those because I think that's both together a part of that overall overhead growth for the year, Rob. Okay. I'll try to answer that. This is Al. I think what you \u2013 the cadence for expenses, you should see the most pressure in probably Q1 and that's because you've got a continuation of sort of the inflationary levels that we saw in third and fourth quarter carrying sequentially over and comparing to Q1 last year with a lot of inflationary pressure wasn't yet built in. So the highest point would probably be Q1 and it will moderate down Q2 and Q3 to more level more that mid-single-digit range. So that's the main thing. In taxes, the 6.25%, I think we are \u2013 last year, what we saw in 2022 was looking back to a strong year, we saw millage rates come in that we thought would roll back more than they did. It surprised us a little bit in the fourth quarter as we talked about. And so that was \u2013 we ended the year a little higher than we expected in 2022. And I think as we move in 2023, we don't expect significant reprising key areas. Our \u2013 we got a pretty \u2013 we have a pretty good beat on what's revaluing this year, it's primarily Texas and part of Atlanta, parts of Georgia, there's primarily Atlanta, and so given what's revaluing and our expectations for millage rates, and we have a few of our cases from 2022 that we're litigating that are spilling over into 2023. And so we've got an estimate of what we think we'll win on that. We may be wrong, but we've got an estimate on that, included in that. So all that together gets us that that 6.25% range. And a lot of unknown in that right now, as we talked about, but we think where we stand, that's a very good estimate. Yeah, I think what we'd say is '23 is a year just that they're still looking back at very strong revenue. It's kind of backward-looking game, looking at the beginning of this year. Still looking at strong revenues for 2022 and a pretty stable cap rate environment has changed, but it's still fairly stable. So that's driving it. I do think your point, I think, is a very good point.  As we move into 2024 that they're looking back in a more normalized year, we would expect some moderation in taxes, primarily in Texas, Georgia, and Florida. We're seeing that in most pressure because there \u2013 it's going to be driven by a normalized top line to your point. So we would agree with that comment. Man, it's \u2013 what we have a high degree of visibility is pretty low other than we have a good beat on what we think the values are. Obviously, we know given the current cap rate environment is what they are. . And John, I mean, 70% to 75% of our tax exposure is from Texas, Florida and Georgia. So it's really going to come down to the millage rates. It's going to turn down to what municipalities need? What are they going to \u2013we expect to have continued strong valuations and probably millage rates rolling back again. Where that all ends up? It's hard to have precise visibility at this point. I mean I think we have consultants that help us. We have a lot of market knowledge. So it's based on \u2013 our estimates based on Texas Georgia and Florida, the key drivers of our expense. And that's \u2013 I wish we had more at this point, but I do think that our experience our history in the markets, our consultants give us a pretty good understanding at this point, as good as we can have until second quarter, John, we'll have more third quarter, we'll have not perfect, but very good knowledge, I would say. That's kind of why we've been a little higher \u2013 I am sorry yes, that's a good question. That's why we put a little bit higher range or a wider range on that, John. You saw that we put seven at the top end of our \u2013 I think that's what we would say. I mean we're 6.25, it could go \u2013 you could have some things go either way. We're hopeful that we have some strong fights in these areas, but I think seven would be several things going against us that we didn't expect. I mean 8, 9 or 10. I mean, given what's revaluing and given the shape of where things are, I think 8, 9, 10 is probably low probability I do think 0 too low end is low probably, I mean the we're looking back again to a very strong 2022. I'm going to use that to put a cap rate on. And so I think it's hard to see much reduction in expectation this year. But as we mentioned, John, as you move into 2024, it would be hard to not be able to argue that some of those because so we would expect what moderation that we see at the beginning 2024."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 27th, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Riesa, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. MAA posted solid results for the third quarter as strong demand for apartment housing across our portfolio drove a 16% increase in leasing traffic volume as compared to last year's third quarter. Higher leasing traffic supported continued solid occupancy and rent growth as was detailed in our earnings release. While as expected, we are seeing a return to more normal seasonal leasing patterns with slower leasing velocity that is typical during the coming holiday season, it's clear that leasing conditions have held up stronger than expected over the back half of this year, and we are carrying solid momentum into calendar year 2023. We will have more details to share about our expectations for next year when we provide earnings guidance for 2023 as part of our fourth quarter earnings release. But absent a severe recession taking place with the resulting weakness in the employment markets, we expect the demand for apartment housing across our portfolio to continue to be strong. At this point, we've not seen any evidence of weakness in the drivers of demand for apartment housing as it applies to our Sunbelt portfolio. Of the leases written in the third quarter, 15% of our new residents were relocating to the Sunbelt from coastal markets. This is comparable to the trends we saw last year. It's also worth noting that the move-outs we had in the third quarter, only 5% were moving out of the Sunbelt. This is also consistent with last year's trends. As noted earlier, leasing traffic is high and resident turnover or move-outs remain well below long-term trends. And importantly, we are seeing no signs of stress in terms of affordability with rent-to-income ratios on the leases completed in Q3, remaining consistent to Q3 of last year in the 22% range and resident payment practices remaining very strong with over 99% of bills rent being collected. As detailed in the earnings release, we are nearing full completion on several of our new development projects, and we have recently started construction on a new property located in Tampa, Florida. In addition, we expect to start construction during the fourth quarter on a new property located in the Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina. During the third quarter, we also closed on two acquisitions where we had initiated negotiations and due diligence earlier in the year. The transaction market has become increasingly choppy as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have presented more challenges. And as a result, seller activity has slowed. We are actively monitoring conditions, but are not currently under contract at the moment with any additional acquisitions. Before turning the call over to Tim to recap more details associated with our property operations, I did want to acknowledge the retirement that -- the announcement that we made last week concerning the planned retirement of Tom Grimes, who has been with our company for the past 28 years. Tom has been a large part -- played a large part of supporting MAA as long and established record of strong performance and steady growth. I'm grateful for Tom's contributions to our company, and we all wish him well. As outlined in last week's release, we have a strong team of leaders at our company with extensive experience, expertise and a record of strong performance we are well-positioned for continued progress as we move forward into 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I will now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. We saw broad-based strength and pricing performance across the portfolio. During the third quarter, with blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved up 13.9%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the third quarter was 16.7% versus the prior year and 5.6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Based on our forecast for in-place rents at the end of 2022, we expect our earned in or baked in rent growth for 2023 to be in the 6% range before considering any new rent growth that may occur in 2023. Alongside the robust pricing performance, average daily occupancy for the quarter remained strong at 95.8%. We have continued to achieve pricing better than our previous expectations in the early part of the fourth quarter with blended lease-over-lease pricing for October to date at a very seasonally strong 8.3%. Average physical occupancy for October to date is in line with expectations at 95.7%. Additionally, on average, we are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 10% for the fourth quarter. Despite projections that supply will likely remain elevated in 2023, that we think at similar levels to 2022, various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our region of the country to continue to benefit from population, household and job growth. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program and our installation of smart home technology that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and door locks as well as leak detection monitoring. In addition, our broader amenity based and more extensive property repositioning program continues to make great progress. The value to residents provided by these programs can be particularly impactful when new supply is being delivered into the market. On average, we are seeing new development being delivered in our markets with monthly rents that are $350 or about 22% higher than the average rent of our current portfolio. This helps drive the value opportunity associated with our repositioning programs. For the third quarter, we completed 2,305 interior unit upgrades and installed 652 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, leases have been repriced at the first eight properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another eight projects that are currently in various stages of construction and unit repricing. Those are all in my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. Despite the challenges in the transaction market, the team continues to make good progress in executing our disposition plan for the year. In addition to the two Fort Worth properties we sold in the second quarter, we closed on the sale of a 396-unit community in Maryland earlier this month. We have one more disposition property located in the Austin market that we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Total expected proceeds for all four disposition remains at the midpoint of our guidance of $325 million with an NOI yield of 4.3%, generating a total expected IRR for these 25-year-old assets of 17.8%. The slowdown in transaction volume that started in the second quarter continued in the third quarter as dislocation in the capital markets increased over the quarter. Most buyers remain on the sidelines and with only a limited number of properties coming to market, price discovery will take some time. However, as we've seen in previous cycles, when deals begin to come to market, the evaluation of counter-party risks will drive decisions, with buyer financial strength and speed of execution being attractive key differentiators. During the third quarter, we were able to opportunistically use those strengths to close on two compelling newly constructed properties for a total of $213 million, generating an initial stabilized NOI yield of 4.7%, which we expect to increase further through our operating platform capabilities. These investments not only provide a higher immediate NOI yield than what we are selling, but they also give us more scale and higher demand, higher growth markets, where we expect to generate higher organic growth over the long term, especially on an after-CapEx basis. Due to their locations near other MAA communities, both investments also provide additional margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years. We continue to make progress in building out our development pipeline, while our under-construction pipeline remained at $444 million at the end of the third quarter. Earlier this month, we started construction on a $197 million, 495-unit project in Tampa, bringing our total active under-construction projects today to $641 million, representing 2,254 units. Predevelopment work is nearly complete on our Raleigh project, and we expect to start construction this quarter. With the scheduled completion of our Windmill Hill property in Austin, during the fourth quarter, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 2,310 units under construction at a total cost of $723 million. Also during the third quarter, we purchased a land parcel for a potential late 2023 start of a 500-unit development in the Denver, MSA. We now own seven and control five development sites with total entitlements in place for approximately 3,700 units. As we've indicated in previous quarters, the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes, but we are hopeful we can start a number of these projects over the next 18 months. Having said that, our balance sheet strength gives us the option to be patient and our construction timing, if it's warrant. Our disciplined approach to asset allocation, including site selection and land valuation will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment decision process. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressure surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules to help mitigate some of the potential cost escalation and schedule expansion that is prevalent in the market today, we are working with our contractors to make commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process. Today, our biggest challenges involve securing labor, obtaining cabinets and electrical components and securing building permits. Our team has been able to work around these issues on the majority of our projects to stay on schedule. In line with the performance of our overall portfolio, operating performance at our development communities in their initial lease-up is strong, with results at each community well ahead of our pro forma expectations. Demand remains strong and the competition from other new supply is not impacting our lease-up performance. During the third quarter, our Jefferson Sand Lake Community in Orlando reached stabilization and due predominantly to the strong rent performance, we expect our stabilized NOI yield to be between 7.8% and 8%, exceeding our original expectation by over 25%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So, I'll turn it over to Al.\nAl Campbell: Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.19 was $0.12 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. About $0.75 or $0.9 of the outperformance came from revenues, stronger than expected rental pricing trends continued into the quarter, producing 14.6% same-store revenue growth, which was over 200 basis points above our expectation. Remaining core FFO per share outperformance primarily came from overhead and other non-operating items during the quarter, which were slightly favorable to expectations. Same-store operating expense growth for the third quarter was impacted by continued inflationary pressures as well as a challenging prior year comparison. If you recall, operating expenses grew only 1.5% during the third quarter of last year. Real estate taxes made up the biggest portion of the variance from our expectations for the third quarter this year. We received a significant amount of information during the quarter, particularly in Florida, reflecting some pressure in both values and millers rates as compared to our expectations. We will continue to aggressively challenge values where we can, but we now expect our real estate tax expense to be at the higher end of our previous range. Revised guidance for the year discussed more in a moment, reflects these expense pressures, but they continue to be more than offset by the strong revenue performance. Our balance sheet remains stronger than ever, providing both protection and opportunity as we move through this volatile market environment. In August, we received an upgrade from S&P to an A- credit rating. We're now rated A- by both S&P and Fitch and continue to have positive discussions with Moody's, which we believe will eventually lead to an upgrade. We also completed the early renewal of our unsecured credit facility at very attractive pricing levels during the quarter, and upside facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion despite a challenging financing market. In addition, we expanded the size of our commercial paper program from $500 million to $625 million to reflect the increase in our credit facility. These two programs provide significant low-cost and flexible capital development program and our future capital needs. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.2 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity available. Our leverage remains historically low. Net debt adjusted EBITDA rate of only 3.97 times. Our debt balances also have significant protection from rising interest rates, as over 97% of our debt is fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with an average maturity of eight years. Finally, given the third quarter outperformance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.20 per share at the midpoint to a range of $8.37 and $8.53 per share or $8.45 at the midpoint, which now represents a 21% growth over the prior year. This increase is primarily a result of higher revenue growth as the strong pricing trends continued into the third quarter with the projected impact of prior year comparisons and seasonal trends coming later than originally projected. We now expect same-store revenue growth for the year to be 13.5% at the midpoint, primarily driven by 125 basis points increase and our effective rent growth expectation for the year over our previous guidance. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy were growing impact from prior year comps and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. We're now seeing the beginning of this impact, albeit a few months later than originally projected. We expect average blended lease pricing to be in the 7% to 8% range for the fourth quarter, which for context is on top of a record high 16% growth captured in the fourth quarter of last year. We also narrowed the expected range for same-store operating expenses for the full year, effectively increasing the midpoint by 25 basis points from last year's guidance -- from last quarter's guidance, excuse me, primarily reflecting the pressure from real estate taxes that I mentioned earlier. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our same-store NOI growth guidance for the year by 200 basis points to a midpoint of 17%. So, that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Riesa. We'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: We will now open the call now up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Just given your experience recently in the transaction market, particularly on the sales, but as you look to acquire maybe if there's interesting opportunities and kind of the positives you mentioned in terms of being a certainty a buyer. How are you thinking cap rates have trended? And then how are you changing your underwriting standards for any future potential opportunities?\nBrad Hill: Yes. Hey Nick, this is Brad. I'd say we've certainly seen cap rates come up here in the third quarter as we've seen interest rates really rise very quickly. Now interest rates are regularly over 6%. We don't have a whole lot of data points frankly, in the third quarter. Second quarter, we commented we saw cap rates in the 37% range. For what we did see close in the third quarter, call it, 4.5% is really where we saw cap rates. But again, not a whole lot of trades there. And I would say that what we've seen -- for what has traded is there's been some characteristic about the property really that has allowed the buyer really to take advantage frequently of previous debt rates through loan assumptions, while taking advantage of the rent profile today. So, I would say that what has traded so far, in my opinion, is not reflective of where the market is going. Most of what we're hearing today is new assets that are being priced. BOVs are going out today 5% or more in terms of the cap rate. So, I would expect to see cap rates rise from where they are today. Where they shake out, that's hard to say. But given where interest rates are, over 6%, given where we are starting to see seasonality come back into play, which we did in last year. The appetite for a significant level of negative leverage from a buyer's perspective, I think that appetite is dissipating a bit. So, my sense is that we'll continue to see cap rates rise a bit next year. But I think it will be mid next year before we really start to see some transactions come to market and transactions to clear. So, I think it's going to take some time to really get visibility into what that looks like.\nNick Joseph: That's very helpful. And then maybe just tying that environment to the new starts and any plans for starts. How do you think about kind of underwriting or starting the project today given maybe the uncertainty of where the acquisition cap rate and trying to price a net risk premium on development?\nBrad Hill: Yes, I mean I'll back up and just start with, we have purposefully sat out of the acquisition market over the last couple of years. The last deal we purchased was in 2019 because really the spreads between development yield and acquisition cap rates had gotten really large over the last few years. So, we have purposefully focused our capital on development. Where we sit today with cap rates of 4.5%, perhaps moving up to 5%, I think you're going to get back to a more normal 100, 125, 150 basis point spread between cap rates and development yields. So, I think there'll need to be some movement going forward. And all of that is really dependent upon the quality of the development that you have where it's located, what the rent trajectory looks like on that asset. But clearly, I think for starts going into next year on the development side, I think you're likely to see a drop off in the construction starts. Developers, we obviously are active in the JV market partnering with developers. We are certainly hearing that equity partners on deals are backing out. Some of the pipeline, I think, is shrinking as you go forward from here because those yields do need to go up a bit. So, we're hopeful at this point that some of that starts to manifest itself through construction costs. But as you know, just like land costs, it's a little sticky. It takes time for that to manifest itself down into the cost, but we are certainly hopeful that yields expand a bit on the development pipeline.\nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Your line is open.\nNeil Malkin: Good morning everyone. Great quarter. Congrats. First, high level, Eric, good to talk with you. I think last quarter -- last two quarters, you kind of started your comments by saying you expect given the favorable demand trends that rent growth or same-store top line trends will continue to be nicely above trend for, I don't know if it was like 2023 or the foreseeable future. But maybe can you just comment on if you still think that's the case? And if, I guess, a more uncertain macro cloud over the general U.S. and global economy maybe has changed that in the near-term? Thanks.\nEric Bolton: Well, thanks, Neil. What I would tell you is that as we start to think about the next year 2023, I'm pretty encouraged still about our ability to continue to drive top line performance that's going to be well above our long-term averages. As Tim alluded to, based on where we sit today, we think the earn-in to next year based on the rent trajectories that we've captured over the last number of months is baked in next year is going to be 6% and then you start to think about what sort of market rent growth we're going to get on top of that next year. And as we sit here today and think about the drivers of demand surrounding the employment markets, the stress of single-family affordability and these net continued positive migration trends that we see across our markets, we continue to see an expectation lease I have a positive rent growth next year on top of the earn-in that we're getting. Now, there is more discussion surrounding the prospects for a recession. I think generally, the thought at the moment is that if it happens, it tends to be -- it will likely be not particularly severe and not particularly prolonged. Certainly, that's the hope we have. And we also are hearing that the idea that it's going to have a huge negative effect on the labor market, in the employment market in general, is not likely to occur. So, who knows exactly what's going to happen. But as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty positive about the outlook going into next year. And we are -- there are a lot of things that we're doing to prepare for the potential for more negative outlooks, particularly pushing rent growth is something that we always do as we think we may be heading into a downturn. Of course, the balance sheet is in really great shape, and we're keeping a lot of capacity available to deal with opportunities that might emerge in a more recessionary environment. And we think that we're going to be well-positioned for whatever we likely are going to see next year. But to your question, I mean, as we sit here today, it's hard to see anything at the moment that suggests to us that any meaningful pullback on the demand trends that we're seeing is likely to take place.\nNeil Malkin: Okay, great. And then real quick, did you guys give your loss to lease, I apologize if I missed it.\nTim Argo: Well, Neil, this is Tim. We talked about the 6% sort of earned in that we think we have next year. If you look at kind of -- I think the question you're probably asking is sort of where our rents sit today here in September compared to are all in place rents that's roughly 3.5% from where we sit today.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. And then the other -- last one for me is maybe for Brad. When you think about the elevated supply or delivery environment over the next 12 months plus you look at the much more difficult permanent financing environment, LTVs, terms, et cetera. And then you also layer on sort of the -- what you expect to be rising cap rates. I mean maybe just talk -- give a sense for like how your capital allocation priorities or playbook looks heading into 2023, particularly given the current cost of -- or the -- your current share price? Thanks.\nBrad Hill: Yes. Well, I'll certainly talk about the external piece of that. As we sit here today, as I mentioned in my comments, we have really spent a lot of time developing our ability to deploy capital externally, both through acquisitions and development. And we are in a really good spot for that. We control, as I mentioned, 3,700 units, both owned and sites that we just have under contract. So, in the land basis of those, as I mentioned, we've been very disciplined in picking sites and we've lost out on sites because, one, the location wasn't the best location in a market and ones that are likely to stress more if things get a little bit shaky in the economy or the land price was too high. So, we feel really good about where we stand today in that regard. And so we have optionality on those projects given the size of our balance sheet. It's not a problem for us to continue to work those sites get to a point where we're ready to pull permits. And if the financing environment is such that it doesn't make sense for us to pull on those or our capital is better used in the acquisition market. We'll certainly lean into that. Just for perspective, in the acquisition side of things, after the last recession for a three-year period, 2010 to 2012, we executed on almost 10,000 units, single transactions, 9,500 units. And if we were able that similar type environment plays out over the next year, two years, three years. that's 10,000 units and at today's pricing even at a discount, that's $3 billion to $4 billion. And so that's what we're really preparing for is for an environment where we're able to execute on opportunities. It may or may not be that size of opportunities. But to your point, the amount of construction that started in 2020, 2021 in our region of the country was significant. And as you mentioned, the cost to refinance that, the cost to extend loans, banks are not going to be willing to do that. They want to clear these loans off their books at this point. So I think you will see, as you get into next year, a number of these merchant developers will need to transact. And I also think the basis of these developments that went under construction in 2020, 2021 still have profit in them. So, I do think a market will be made on these assets, and there will be an opportunity for us to step in and execute in that area.\nNeil Malkin: Hey that\u2019s awesome. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning. Just going back to Nick Joseph's question on underwriting, I think you guys quoted a 17% levered IRR on the transactions in the quarter. So one is, curious what the unlevered IRR is. And then second, more importantly, you guys Sunbelt over the past decade or so has benefited big time from cap rate compression. Certainly, as your comments just said, everyone expects cap rates to come up. So, how do you think IRRs are going to -- how are you underwriting IRRs over the next sort five years of investing, given that the past decade has just been this incredible dual tailwind to both cap rate compression and rent growth? So first, what the unlevered IRRs were on the deals sold in the quarter and then two, the latter part, how you're underwriting new deals without the benefit of the compression tailwind?\nBrad Hill: I'll start with that, and Eric can jump in if he needs to. The unlevered IRR on what we expect to sell this year is just under 13%. So still a really good IRR generated on those assets, which I'll also mention just, by the way, our 25-year-old assets to generate those IRRs. In terms of cap rate compression, yes, we've benefited from that over the last few years. And that will not obviously be the case going forward. But I think that's -- indicates really a healthy environment where we get back to the point where location of assets really matters, and that will drive the value of an asset. And I think that benefits us long term because I think we've got some of the best located assets in the best markets in our region of the country. And I think that differentiation between cap rates based on location and markets will absolutely benefit us as we go forward from here.\nEric Bolton: And Alex, this is Eric. And I'll add to what Brad is saying there that cap rates in a given market and cap rates across this region. It's a function of two things. It's a function of obviously what's happening with interest rates and how asset pricing is being reconfigured, if you will. But to some degree, cap rates are also a function of sort of the demand-supply dynamic for capital -- investment capital wanting to deploy in apartment real estate. And you get a lot of buyers in the market trying to chase a few sale opportunities is going to head downward pressure more so on cap rates. And what I would tell you is that this region of the country that we do business in, these markets continue to show very strong demand dynamics leading to job growth, population growth, household formation trends. Those variables were present before COVID, and they were strong during COVID. And so as a consequence of that, I think that as you begin to think about how cap rates may change, I would argue that we may not see cap rates move up as much across a number of our markets as you might think. And we may -- and I would argue that they're not going to move up as much as you might see in other markets or other regions of the country because of the rent growth prospects and the demand dynamics that we are seeing that are so positive across this region of the country. And then to your other point about IRR, candidly, it's not something that we spend a lot of energy focusing on. Most of the modeling that we do is built on kind of a 10-year model. And to try to think about what an extra cap rate would be appropriate in 10 years from now is who knows. And what we're really looking to do is compare the opportunity to deploy capital, create a stabilized yield on that capital that is complementary to the existing yield. We're getting off the existing asset base and then also obviously look at it on an after-CapEx basis, so as we think about the opportunity to continue to grow the dividend. And as we look at an opportunity in front of us at the moment, certainly, the development continues to make a lot of sense. We're going to be very thoughtful and careful with that. As we've talked about in the past, we're not going to see our development pipeline get more than about 3% or so of our enterprise value. So, we're going to keep it at a very manageable level. But we have a lot of dry powder that we're keeping available at the moment because should the opportunity on the acquisition front really start to pick up and present itself in a big way, we'll be ready to jump on that and we've demonstrated in the past that a lot of value opportunity in that sort of focus.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Eric, that's helpful. So, the second question plays into that. A lot of market talk about concern about supply in the Sunbelt, it seems that over time, the Sunbelt has handily handled supply, maybe with the exception of like the Houston, for example. So maybe you could just talk a little bit more about some of the supply that you're seeing in the market. Do you see it just sort of dispersed across your markets? Do you see it more concentrated in certain submarkets? And are there any areas where you could see yourself maybe next summer going, yes, this market or that market, we have felt a supply impact?\nEric Bolton: Well, broadly speaking, on the supply picture, I mean, what we see right now based on the data that we're looking at suggests that 2023 deliveries are going to be very comparable to what we saw in 2022. And actually based -- when you do an NOI-weighted analysis against our portfolio, it's actually down just slightly in 2023 versus 2022. So, I don't think that -- we're not sitting here today looking at numbers that suggest to us that we're going to see a big lift in the supply deliveries next year relative to what we've been experiencing for the last year or two, particularly last year or 2022, I should say. So we -- because of some of the challenges that we've seen with construction labor and materials and permitting and all that goes into predevelopment, we're just -- we just don't see supply likely picking up, broadly speaking, in a huge way next year in 2023 as compared to what we've experienced in 2022. The other thing that I will tell you, to your point, Alex, is, yes, I mean, I've heard about new supply worries for 28 years since I've been here. And it's -- and I will tell you, it's never been a problem. It can create some moderation here and there across the portfolio, given markets, given submarkets from time to time. But it's never been such an issue for us that we haven't been able to work through it. And one of the things that we've always done with our strategy is we work very hard to do what we can to mitigate some of the supply pressure it does occur from time to time. That's one of the reasons why we are diversified the way we are in both secondary as well as in large markets. We have a very affordable price point broadly in our portfolio. The new product coming in to the market is generally running 25%, 30% higher rents than what we are charging that creates some room for us, if you will, in terms of being able to weather that pressure, not only that, but also creates a tremendous opportunity on the redevelopment front. So we're -- as we sit here today, we are not particularly nervous about supply levels next year as we go into 2023.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question today from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Eric, you and the team have referenced being open to a large transaction I think probably over a year now and have been historically. And I'm just curious what you think the benefits of additional scale are to the company at this point? And what really would you be trying to achieve strategically from a portfolio allocation standpoint through a potentially larger deal?\nEric Bolton: Well, it's hard to put a number on or quantify what additional financial benefits may come from scale. We feel like, frankly, at the point we are at the moment that we're fairly efficient in terms of what we're able to do. Certainly, put more assets against this existing platform, there's going to be at the margin, some additional opportunity that comes from that, but it's not something that we're candidly, actively trying to initiate, if you will, right now. For us, right, our focus really is the opportunity to drive increasing scale in a very disciplined fashion through the development effort that we have and through emerging opportunity for one-off acquisitions that we've done a lot of over the years. And we think that with our development pipeline headed towards $700 billion of active construction with emerging opportunities surrounding acquisitions that we think are likely to pick up more so next year, it puts us in a position to put together fairly meaningful levels of external growth that we think we can capture just through those processes that we have without the need to go out and do something more strategic in nature. We're always open to those ideas and we'll continue to monitor it, but it's not something that we feel compelling need to do in any way right now.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then I'm curious, where do you guys expect market rent growth across your portfolio to end the year? And just to be clear, I'm focused on sort of your broader submarkets, not the MAA portfolio specifically. And then do you think next year should be higher, lower or sort of in line with 2022?\nTim Argo: Austin, this is Tim. The market rent growth we've seen to date is about 7% or so, when you strip out sort of the baked in and everything else. It's hard to say that we expect rent growth next year to be at the level that we've seen this year, which certainly has been between this year and 2021 then record levels. But as Eric laid out a little bit ago, we don't see in the near-term, anything changing too much from the demand standpoint, supply kind of is what it is, like we talked about. So, we think we're still in a period where we can see some better than average, if you will, but likely not to the extent we're seeing the last 12 months or so.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's fair. And then just last quick clarification. What's embedded in the 8.3% blended lease rate for October between new and renewal? And then presumably, should we assume, I think you said 7% to 8% for all of 4Q that you don't expect a lot of movement there through the balance of the year?\nTim Argo: So, as we said, the October new lease is 5.7%, renewal is 10.7% and the comment we did make around the rest of the year as we're seeing on the renewal side, somewhere around that 10% for what we've signed so far.\nAl Campbell: I'll just follow-up that the forecast that we've put out does imply a 7% to 8% blended for the fourth quarter. You're right, we don't expect it to move much, number one. And remember, there's -- most of the leases have been signed in the second and third quarter already anyway.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Of course. No, that\u2019s great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And we will take our next question today from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to go back to the 15% of move-ins or relocations from the coast. I think it's surprising to hear people wouldn't expect that the numbers are still strong on that versus a year ago. And so I guess what I'm wondering is if you have any insight on whether certain markets are benefiting more within your portfolio? And then from a relocation standpoint, what you've learned from where -- which coastal regions people are moving? And also maybe you could talk about do you have any insight on the job profile of the people who are moving.\nTim Argo: Nick, this is Tim. Yes, we're at the 15% for Q3 for sort of move-ins from non-M&A states. That's been pretty consistent. It's kind of range from that 14% to 16% sort of range back to the beginning of 2021 or so. And so we're seeing it consistent. It's coming primarily from New York and California, some of that makes sense given they're the largest states. But particularly some of the markets that are benefiting are Dallas, Tampa, Nashville, Charleston, Phoenix, Savannah. Those are the largest ones, and that's been pretty consistent. And we are seeing our -- the quality of resident, if you will, and the income levels have been pretty strong. Our rent-to-income ratio stay consistent now for the last couple of years, around 22%. So, we are seeing more sort of professionals, finance and tech and that sort of thing coming into our markets.\nNick Yulico: And is there any insight on that -- that's helpful, Tim. Any insight on whether these people are working remotely or in physical in-person jobs in your cities?\nTim Argo: It's hard to say. We haven't seen any big significant changes that we've noticed at the property level. It's a little bit hard to tell, but I think it's -- there's certainly some, but not -- probably not quite to the level we saw like a year or so ago.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. And then just following up on some of the supply questions. I mean as you look across your markets, over the next year, maybe you could just point out which markets you do see some incremental supply pressure that could be meaningful versus some other larger markets where the supply impact looks pretty manageable.\nTim Argo: Yes. To point out a couple, we think we'll be on the higher side, likely are Austin and Charlotte would be a couple and Austin's a pretty interesting test case. It's had high supply now for a few years in a row. Expect that to continue, but it also ranks at the top in terms of job growth, in migration, household formation, population. So I think to the extent that demand side stays where it is. We don't -- despite that supply, we don't think it will have a significant impact. Dallas is one where supply has been pretty light, and we've seen that market come on pretty strong over the last few months. We think Dallas is one that can that can perform pretty well. The rest of the markets, it's pretty evenly spread, but also in Charlotte being the two that we'll probably keep our eye on a little more.\nNick Yulico: All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And we will go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to understand this dynamic. You had the strongest lease-over-lease growth rates this quarter among your peers, when you ended the quarter with the lowest loss to lease and that same dynamic has continued sort of like this quarter, low loss to lease, highest rent growth. I'm just wondering if there's a unique way that you calculate loss to lease or maybe there's a timing difference. And if the loss to lease today, it's roughly 3%, is that roughly where your lease growth will be going forward?\nTim Argo: So, the loss release of 3.5%, the way that is calculated is basically just looking at the rents we did in September that went into effect in September as compared to all in-place rents right now, and that's 3.5%. And so we typically see that number. That's calculated in that way. It's going to be the highest in the summer when rents are strongest and the seasonality is the strongest. It will come down a little bit as you get into the fall and likely into the winter, assuming you're seeing that normal seasonality. So that -- in my opinion, that number is pretty volatile. I mean it's going to move around. And that's why one of the points we're making is with where we expect December to be in all of our in-place rents that will be there in December, if you just carry that through to 2023 and assume we don't get any more rent growth, you get to 6%. So to me, that's -- in terms of trying to figure out what it's going to do to impact 2023, that's kind of why we focus on that 6%.\nJohn Kim: Okay. So, it's in placement versus what you signed versus the market, which may or may not be the same number. My second question is the concept of rent control has almost been an overnight potential risk in Orlando, one of your top five markets. And I'm wondering if you're concerned that this may actually be tasked given it was just put on the ballot as a few weeks ago, and you may not have enough time to educate voters on the downfalls of rent control.\nRob DelPriore: Hey John, this is Rob. Yes, I think if it gets on the ballot, I think it's okay. The one court that's actually looked at the ordinance itself effectively said that they consider that it violates for a law. So even if it passes, ultimately, I don't think that it will be upheld as an effective ordinance. And then if you look at it for us, we've got nine properties in Orange County, seven in same-store, and it's about 4.4% of our third quarter same-store NOI. And we went back and looked at it as it were in place in 2022, and it would really only have an 18 basis point impact on same-store revenue and about a 17 basis point impact on total revenue. So overall, not that material to us as we think about it. So, we think it probably doesn't pass, and we think it's not material to us overall anyway. And also that was in some of the highest growth rate rent increases that we've had over this period in Orange County compared to until recently, a relatively low CPI.\nJohn Kim: Regardless if it passes or not, does it change the way that you look at how much you push renewal lease?\nRob DelPriore: I mean if it passes will be guarded in how much we push renewal rates until there's a court decision that says that it's invalid.\nEric Bolton: And John, as I think you know, if it passes, it's only good for one year, and then they have to go through the process again. So again, we think that the downside risk to us is, frankly, fairly small in this topic.\nJohn Kim: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question today from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Hey good morning everybody. Thanks. So, there's been a big divergence in how single-family home prices have been trending and you have some areas in the Southeast that have been holding up well, but then you have markets like Austin and Phoenix where they're dropping significantly. Obviously, multifamily is different than single family. But I'm curious if you're seeing any differences in apartment demand in areas where you're seeing home prices show more weakness.\nTim Argo: Hey, this is Tim. Not necessarily. I mean we look obviously at the move-outs to home buying and that sort of thing, and it's become a much smaller piece of our turnover, and that's pretty consistent across the market. So with the recent move up in interest rates, I think that probably continues even if with prices have gone down, interest rates have gone up. So the total cost is not any less than it really was before. So right now, we're not seeing any change from what we've been seeing.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. What I was sort of getting at is, is there any sort of like underlying demand weakness in general for housing in a market like Austin or Phoenix that looks somewhat new?\nTim Argo: Yes, we're not seeing traffic has been up across the board in pretty much all of our markets. We're not seeing any of the kind of doubling up. Our average occupant per unit is the same, whether you're looking at efficiencies, one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, three-bedrooms. So we're not seeing enough phenomenon of people trying to double up or anything like that. So, as of right now, all the trends that we look at for that kind of thing have been pretty consistent.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And then on the development starts that you mentioned for this quarter, can you talk about what the expected yield is on those?\nBrad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. Both of those are 5.5%, which is what we have been consistently underwriting recently. But I will say for both of these deals. We feel really, really good one, about the location of those assets. And then two, just about our ability to outperform that. As we -- I indicated in my comments, the outperformance on our recent Jefferson Sand Lake project. Certainly, that's a little bit different because of the cost basis, but there are some characteristics there that I think carry over to all of our developments. And number one is that we're very conservative in our rent growth projections on these assets significantly below what the market rent growth projections are over the first three or four years, which gives us a level of conservatism. Number two, I would say that as we expect over the next year or so, costs could come down on the construction side, which means we are less likely to dip into contingency and things of that nature on our projects. If we're able to save those expenses on these projects, that's a, call it, a 40 basis points improvement in yields on that. And then I would say the third thing is that our taxes that we have underwritten on these projects are reflective of today's valuation. So, to the extent we get some relief in that area. It's a lagging -- kind of a lagging item. But if we get some relief in that area, we also will see some relief on our expense pressure on the tax side. So we feel really good about where we've underwritten those assets and our ability to really improve the yields from the conservative numbers that we underwrote.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Appreciate.\nOperator: We will take our next question today from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open. Rich Anderson, your line is open, please check the mute function on your phone.\nRich Anderson: Sorry about that. My headset never works anymore. First of all, congrats to Tom. As I get older, I get increasingly envious when I hear retirement. So congratulations. I also hit you. My first question is somewhat related to loss to lease, but not entirely. We did kind of a quick analysis of the multifamily space at some point between second and third quarter to compare your rent versus the average rent within your markets, including all competitors and so on. And you sit at about 7% above the average market rent. I don't know if you agree or disagree with that, but that's where we came on MAA. I'm wondering if you think that in a recession being above the market average is a comfortable place to be if people start to reduce their cost structure in a recessionary environment and they might dial down to lower quality and so on so that they can continue to have their own apartment, is that a pressure that you're worried about at all? You're seeing at all where you guys are operating perhaps a cream of the crop level versus some of your competition, but could be -- put you in a vulnerable spot if we do get into a deeper type of recession.\nEric Bolton: Rich, this is Eric. I would tell you, I mean, frankly, we think that our price point in the markets where we do business is exactly where we want to be. I wouldn't -- 7% above average, I wouldn't call a cream of the crop. Cream the crop is going to be to all the new stuff that's been built in the last two or three years, which is going to be 20% to 30% higher than the market average. If we had a portfolio of nothing. But that -- yes, I'd be more nervous about it. But what we typically see is a trade down from the really high-end product to our more affordable product to then go significantly below the market average, you start to get into a different submarket and you start to get into less amenities and you start to get into a product that is going to, I think, not be as appealing, if you will, to a lot of the resident profile that we serve. And I think that what we are likely to see if we find ourselves in a recession where people are really starting to think about how to lower their housing cost as you're going to see people in the very top end of the market doubling up in our properties. And I think that, that's what we've seen in the past and what we would likely see again if we found ourselves in a deep recession.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Good enough. And then the second question is early in the calls mentioned new rents to your point, new developments coming in at 22% -- rents 22% above where you guys are, which invites the opportunity to do upgrades to your portfolio. But that strategy only works if that 22% higher rent is actually working. In other words, those developments that are happening and coming to market are leasing up effectively and quickly. Are you still seeing that, whether it's you or somebody else are developments meeting expectations? Or is that starting to wane a little bit? And then if that is the case, maybe the idea of this being an opportunity for you to upgrade your existing portfolio, maybe takes a bit of a backseat.\nBrad Hill: Rich, this is Brad. I'll address the part of that, which is the current lease-up dynamics in the market. We're certainly not seeing pressure and struggles from the development community in terms of the lease-up performance of assets that are in lease-up. I mean our -- the five properties that we have right now that are in lease-up, if they're an example the lease-up velocity continues to be very, very strong. And those are the products, by the way, that are competing directly with the new supply in the market. velocities are strong. Traffic is still very good in our markets. And then the rents on those assets continue to outperform. So if that's a proxy for what we're seeing in the market, we're just not seeing in our region of the country struggling fundamentals yet even on the new development side. So, we're not seeing developers under pressure, fire selling their -- or leasing their properties and offering multiple months concessions. We're not seeing that at this point. Everybody is pretty disciplined. The fundamentals still appear to be very, very strong in the lease-up properties.\nTim Argo: Rich, I'll add one point to that. The areas we're actually doing some unit interior renovates this year and the ones we're looking at for next year, it's actually a little bit wider debt kind of in that 25% to 27% range on the comps we're looking at. And we're not looking to get to that rent. We're -- as you know, we're kind of usually getting in that 9% to 10% range. So still creates that gap that we think we can execute on.\nRich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we will go next to Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChandni Luthra: Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one. How do you think about the outlook for real estate taxes next year, I mean you talked about Florida a little bit? But last quarter, you had spoken about expectation of rollbacks in Texas. So, what are you seeing there right now? And how do you think about real estate taxes going into 2023? Thank you.\nAl Campbell: Yes, this is Al. I can touch on that. So as we talked about, really in our portfolio, Texas, Florida and even Georgia, they are the primary areas of our taxes and our pressure that we've been saying together. They're somewhere around probably a little bit over two-thirds of our tax cost. And the primary pressure comes from Texas and Florida that you just mentioned. And so for the full year, that certainly we're looking at Texas is probably a little over half of that two-thirds. So, you see the significance there. We spend a lot of time working on challenging the values as we talked about when we're from informal to formal. So a lot of pressure on that. I think -- and so -- the change this quarter though was really about information coming in, in Florida. We got a lot of information late and they typically do that and it caused us to believe that the values were a little higher than we thought they were going to be in Florida and the miller rates so we're seeing rollbacks not quite what we're expecting. So, I would say that in general, across the portfolio, we talked about high assessments with rollbacks, that's still occurring. And we are seeing that occur, not quite what we'd expected that caused that increase that we put in the guidance. As we look into next year, I think it's important to think about there's two main components you got to look at one -- it's obviously a backward-looking process. And so you're going to have one positive impact maybe the change in cap rate environment that we talked about that this morning. But the other side is they're looking at a really strong top line revenue growth this year when they set the values. So both those coming together, what we would say is as we look forward next year probably looks a lot like this year with maybe a little bit of upward bias because of that strong revenue performance. But as we move into 2024, and pass some of the comments Brad was saying on the acquisitions and development, you would expect that the things settle down and we make a little bit of moderation at that point because of the stabilized cap rate and rent growth environments.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question today from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Al, why the $0.16 range for fourth quarter FFO per share, seems wide sitting here basically November one with a limited number of leases rolling through year-end? What drives you towards the low and high end of that range?\nAl Campbell: I think we moved that, Rob, we certainly do that each quarter as we look at it. And just really, I think it would be something significant occupancy really at this point. I mean I think -- or some unforeseen item that we didn't anticipate. So I think to your point, -- the rent pricing that is the biggest piece is pretty certain and depending on -- excuse me, performance is pretty certain. Even if the pricing moves around from that expectation on the tip of the spear, the few leases in the fourth quarter, so that would have a less impact. It would have to be something in occupancy or in significant surprise in expenses. We don't expect that. And we did continue to narrow our range showing that there's a little more certainty, but I just felt that was prudent to leave that at that level.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And in terms of the expenses, are you having any material hurricane expenses here in the fourth quarter?\nAl Campbell: We're -- you saw in the release, we had -- in the third quarter, we incurred about $1.6 million of expenses for that. We were very fortunate in our portfolio there. I think had minimal impact from that. We'll have some cleanup costs and some water intrusion and some roofing things. But expense incurred $1.6 million which you saw it's not -- it's in -- it's in operating expenses outside of same store. You see that disclosed in the press release. We'll have a little bit more capital items. But together, the cost are going to be pretty significant. We are very fortunate.\nRob Stevenson: All right. And are you seeing any uptick in the last 30, 60 days in either bad debt or delinquencies in the portfolio?\nAl Campbell: We're -- I'll let Rob talk about the details if he wants to. But we have very good performance really going all the way back to COVID. The biggest spread was worse point about 200 basis points of delinquency. We have been, for the last several quarters, very good, though we've almost our normal long-term range, which is about 40 to 50 basis points. We call it 60 to 70 basis points now. So we've been performing very well, not quite to where we were pre-COVID but certainly performing very well.\nTim Argo: Just one point there, Rob, to is just our current resident receivable balance is about September 30 is about $5 million compared to $5.3 million at June 30. So kind of as Al said, I mean, trending down in the right direction.\nRob Stevenson: All right. And then last one for me. Why only 658 smart homes in the third quarter versus more than 9,000 in the second quarter and 2000 to 3000 expected in the fourth quarter? Was it a supply of the devices issue? Was it something else that sort of drove the sort of lull in the third quarter on that?\nTim Argo: Yes, there is a little bit of supply chain issues there and getting -- there's a couple of different models out there and kind of getting some of the new ones in that we think will happen in the fourth quarter. We had preplanned everything we did in the first couple of quarters, which is why it was skewed that way, but we expect to get a little more normal time line here in the fourth quarter and then certainly into 2023 as well.\nRob Stevenson: All right. Tom, you'll be missed, wish you all the best. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We will move next to Alan Peterson with Green Street. Your line is open.\nAlan Peterson: Hey guys. Thanks for the time. I was just hoping to follow Eric's comments on the trade down dynamic. Tim, based on the conversations you're having with your field level personnel, are you starting to notice that trade-down occur in your portfolio in any given market?\nTim Argo: Not necessarily. I mean I will say, actually, if you look at our blended pricing for Q3 more of our B-style assets or which you might consider the B assets in our portfolio actually did a little bit better in terms of blended pricing. So we're not seeing our existing portfolio. The turnover was a little higher in some of our secondary markets that have some B assets, but we're also replacing those with residents where the rent to income ratio has not changed. So I think to the extent we are seeing it here and there, we're able to quickly replace it with residents that have that strong affordability.\nAlan Peterson: Awesome. And then in regards to the price sensitivity, what markets are you seeing the most price sensitivity? Would it be those secondary markets that are seeing a little bit higher turnover versus the rest of the portfolio? Is it -- are there any other primary markets that are flashing maybe a yellow versus red right now?\nTim Argo: No, like I said, in the secondary markets, the pricing performance has been pretty strong and the B type asset has been pretty strong. I mean, we are seeing some moderation. Most of it's driven by seasonality. Phoenix is one that's moderated a little bit, but it has had a really strong rent growth now for two to three years straight. But the demand fundamentals, as we talked about, are really strong. Supply kind of is what it is at a similar level. But outside of Houston and D.C., which we talked about, have been a little bit weaker markets, all the other ones are hanging in pretty consistently with what they've been doing.\nAlan Peterson: Understood. Well, appreciate the time guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question today from Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.\nWes Golladay: Hey good morning everyone and congratulations, Tom. I just have a quick question on the -- more the private developer. What are they saying today yields have been quite volatile. But if rates were to stay where they're at today, where do you think your required yield would be for a new development? And when I look at Mid-America, I think best-in-class balance sheet operations, you trend had imply fixed cap cost of capital may be around 7%. I mean at a high level, I'm thinking if things stay where they're at, it has to be in the high single digits. Would you agree with that?\nBrad Hill: This is Brad. I would say that's probably a little higher. I mean I think what developers are generally trying to solve for is return on cost, a year one return on cost on their development, similar to what we're looking at on a stabilized yield. But those are trending up to over 6% at this point. I think aside from construction costs, really what the developers have been hit with is interest rates have gone from call it, 3.5%, 4% and now they're probably double that. So, their interest expense have gone up tremendously on their projects. Really, in the -- from the underwriting perspective because of the seasonality we're seeing that didn't see earlier this year, I suspect when they go back in at this point, and get construction cost price updates they may not increase quite as much as they have been, but their rent growth when they update those at this point is showing seasonality. So their yields are probably under pressure from that. And then also just the interest expense line item. So, developments, I was at a conference last week with quite a few developers in their is a general sense that most projects at this point that are not kicked off really are being pushed out. Land timing is being pushed out. Projects are being shelved at this point. So, I think there's just a broad recalibration going on in the market. And it's hard to say what developers are looking for in the private side, but it's definitely higher than what it has been and it's going to be somewhere return on cost in the six to mid-6% range, I suspect.\nWes Golladay: That\u2019s great. Thank you for that.\nOperator: We will go now to Barry [Indiscernible] from Mizuho Group. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Barry on for [Indiscernible]. First of all, congratulations on an impressive quarter. I just wanted to get some clarity on the renewal rates you cited. I know correctly that it was 5.7% in October, but expecting 10% in the fourth quarter overall.\nTim Argo: No. The 5.7 was the new lease rate in October. Renewals were 10.6.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. thank you. And on the typical seasonality being pushed back, do you see weaker demand and recent traffic kind of a potential headwind in Q1 and Q2?\nTim Argo: We've not seen any lag or any reduction in leasing traffic. We talked about our traffic in Q3 was up, our leads are up. So the seasonality will just be relative to Q2 and Q3, yes, traffic will be lower and leads will be lower than what we see in those quarters, but no different than we typically expect to see in the winter season. So there's nothing to indicate anything different other than as we've talked about, I do think the seasonal or the normal seasonality returns more so this year, certainly that we did not see last year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. And my second question is on just bad debt trends. We've seen some of your coastal peers report an uptake. Is that kind of what you're seeing?\nTim Argo: What trend, you kind of cut out there for a second.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a trend in your bad debt portfolio, bad debt?\nTim Argo: I think we just talked about a moment ago, I think we've had a very good performance in our bad debt. Our delinquencies for really the last year, 1.5 years. So I think we're a little above in delinquency. Our long-term rate, which is really low 40 to 50 basis points of rents historically, we call it, 60, 70 basis points range, but still very strong. Don't see an indication that says that's changing today or expect that change as we move into fourth quarter next year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go now to Aaron Hecht from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nAaron Hecht: Thanks for taking my question. Times relocating from the coast, are those renters typically more transient? And do they typically move to buy a home more quickly or for a trend in terms of those coastal renters come in?\nTim Argo: We haven't seen any indications that are more transient. I mean if you -- or certainly more transient to move back out of our footprint. We've talked about the move-ins from out of footprint, bringing in that 15% range now for a while. The move back out of our footprint is 5% has been that way for a long time. So we don't see any trends that they're moving back to where they came from, so to speak, and haven't seen any significant trends and types of turnover, anything like that. So no indications of it.\nAaron Hecht: Yes, I was saying more wealthy renter that's entering the market or looking for a holding purchase, but it doesn't sound like it. How is that 15% rate this quarter compared to like pre-pandemic over the last several quarters. Is that increase significantly?\nTim Argo: It was -- I would say, pre-COVID at range in that 9% to 10% range. So we have seen it pick up some, but it has now remained consistent, like we said for the last two or three years. And you're talking about just of our move in. So, when you think about the number of units with turnover and all that, it's a relatively -- it's significant in terms of it's picked up, but it's still -- it's not driving the bulk of our demand or the bulk of our outperformance.\nAaron Hecht: Great. And then on the property management technologies savings initiatives. Just wondering, are you guys taking property managers off of the property? Are they responsible for more than one to maybe there are managers there all the time? Some of these managers are changing in that format. I'm wondering if that's something you guys are looking at?\nTim Argo: Yes, we are testing and looking at some, if you want call it, pods or whatever, where we have some oversight roles at managing multiple properties, particularly ones that are within close proximity and with the new CRM we have in place that's helped enable that. And there's some other things we're looking at that will help enable that. But yes, and we talked about that a little bit on the last call. That's something that we're actively engaged in right now.\nAaron Hecht: Appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our final question today from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. A question on the multifamily development, redevelopment, I guess, one of your peers said that they are maybe pulling back on that next year due to some uncertainty and some timing. Just curious what you are you going to keep your schedule in terms of redevelopment next year? And are you still seeing kind of the returns that you expect in the October end?\nBrad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. So we've got, as I mentioned earlier, a number of properties between four to six that we can start next year. Those will probably be weighted mid to late next year is my sense. So we've got a little bit of time on those really to kind of figure out where the market is. And frankly, just to see if there's some reset on the construction cost side of these projects. So we've got some time under our belt from that. But as I mentioned in my comments, we have the ability to be patient on those. -- and the discipline that we use to help us find sites and really underwriting our deals will also be the same discipline that we use in determining when we -- when is the right time to start construction on these assets. So, I'd say it's a little early right now to tell if that will push off at all. We do have the ability both from a timing perspective and then just also the balance sheet capacity to be able to hold those assets if we need to those land assets.\nAnthony Powell: Maybe one more for me. In terms of -- what are you seeing in terms of land cost for new developments? I know you talked about cap rates and how those are moving? How are land costs trending? And how is that impacting your ability to do deals?\nBrad Hill: Yes, I mean, land is probably the last component to adjust if there's an adjustment on the development side. construction costs, that takes a little while to manifest itself into the cost of the project and then land is the last thing that adjusts. And at this point, we're not really seeing any adjustment in land prices, and it will just take some time to really see if there's anything to that.\nAnthony Powell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: No closing remarks. We appreciate everybody hanging with us this morning, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you over the next few weeks with upcoming conferences. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Hey John, this is Rob. Yes, I think if it gets on the ballot, I think it's okay. The one court that's actually looked at the ordinance itself effectively said that they consider that it violates for a law. So even if it passes, ultimately, I don't think that it will be upheld as an effective ordinance. And then if you look at it for us, we've got nine properties in Orange County, seven in same-store, and it's about 4.4% of our third quarter same-store NOI. And we went back and looked at it as it were in place in 2022, and it would really only have an 18 basis point impact on same-store revenue and about a 17 basis point impact on total revenue. So overall, not that material to us as we think about it. So, we think it probably doesn't pass, and we think it's not material to us overall anyway. And also that was in some of the highest growth rate rent increases that we've had over this period in Orange County compared to until recently, a relatively low CPI. I mean if it passes will be guarded in how much we push renewal rates until there's a court decision that says that it's invalid."

            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew and good morning. MAA posted solid results for the third quarter as strong demand for apartment housing across our portfolio drove a 16% increase in leasing traffic volume as compared to last year's third quarter. Higher leasing traffic supported continued solid occupancy and rent growth as was detailed in our earnings release. While as expected, we are seeing a return to more normal seasonal leasing patterns with slower leasing velocity that is typical during the coming holiday season, it's clear that leasing conditions have held up stronger than expected over the back half of this year, and we are carrying solid momentum into calendar year 2023. We will have more details to share about our expectations for next year when we provide earnings guidance for 2023 as part of our fourth quarter earnings release. But absent a severe recession taking place with the resulting weakness in the employment markets, we expect the demand for apartment housing across our portfolio to continue to be strong. At this point, we've not seen any evidence of weakness in the drivers of demand for apartment housing as it applies to our Sunbelt portfolio. Of the leases written in the third quarter, 15% of our new residents were relocating to the Sunbelt from coastal markets. This is comparable to the trends we saw last year. It's also worth noting that the move-outs we had in the third quarter, only 5% were moving out of the Sunbelt. This is also consistent with last year's trends. As noted earlier, leasing traffic is high and resident turnover or move-outs remain well below long-term trends. And importantly, we are seeing no signs of stress in terms of affordability with rent-to-income ratios on the leases completed in Q3, remaining consistent to Q3 of last year in the 22% range and resident payment practices remaining very strong with over 99% of bills rent being collected. As detailed in the earnings release, we are nearing full completion on several of our new development projects, and we have recently started construction on a new property located in Tampa, Florida. In addition, we expect to start construction during the fourth quarter on a new property located in the Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina. During the third quarter, we also closed on two acquisitions where we had initiated negotiations and due diligence earlier in the year. The transaction market has become increasingly choppy as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have presented more challenges. And as a result, seller activity has slowed. We are actively monitoring conditions, but are not currently under contract at the moment with any additional acquisitions. Before turning the call over to Tim to recap more details associated with our property operations, I did want to acknowledge the retirement that -- the announcement that we made last week concerning the planned retirement of Tom Grimes, who has been with our company for the past 28 years. Tom has been a large part -- played a large part of supporting MAA as long and established record of strong performance and steady growth. I'm grateful for Tom's contributions to our company, and we all wish him well. As outlined in last week's release, we have a strong team of leaders at our company with extensive experience, expertise and a record of strong performance we are well-positioned for continued progress as we move forward into 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I will now turn the call over to Tim. Well, thanks, Neil. What I would tell you is that as we start to think about the next year 2023, I'm pretty encouraged still about our ability to continue to drive top line performance that's going to be well above our long-term averages. As Tim alluded to, based on where we sit today, we think the earn-in to next year based on the rent trajectories that we've captured over the last number of months is baked in next year is going to be 6% and then you start to think about what sort of market rent growth we're going to get on top of that next year. And as we sit here today and think about the drivers of demand surrounding the employment markets, the stress of single-family affordability and these net continued positive migration trends that we see across our markets, we continue to see an expectation lease I have a positive rent growth next year on top of the earn-in that we're getting. Now, there is more discussion surrounding the prospects for a recession. I think generally, the thought at the moment is that if it happens, it tends to be -- it will likely be not particularly severe and not particularly prolonged. Certainly, that's the hope we have. And we also are hearing that the idea that it's going to have a huge negative effect on the labor market, in the employment market in general, is not likely to occur. So, who knows exactly what's going to happen. But as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty positive about the outlook going into next year. And we are -- there are a lot of things that we're doing to prepare for the potential for more negative outlooks, particularly pushing rent growth is something that we always do as we think we may be heading into a downturn. Of course, the balance sheet is in really great shape, and we're keeping a lot of capacity available to deal with opportunities that might emerge in a more recessionary environment. And we think that we're going to be well-positioned for whatever we likely are going to see next year. But to your question, I mean, as we sit here today, it's hard to see anything at the moment that suggests to us that any meaningful pullback on the demand trends that we're seeing is likely to take place. And Alex, this is Eric. And I'll add to what Brad is saying there that cap rates in a given market and cap rates across this region. It's a function of two things. It's a function of obviously what's happening with interest rates and how asset pricing is being reconfigured, if you will. But to some degree, cap rates are also a function of sort of the demand-supply dynamic for capital -- investment capital wanting to deploy in apartment real estate. And you get a lot of buyers in the market trying to chase a few sale opportunities is going to head downward pressure more so on cap rates. And what I would tell you is that this region of the country that we do business in, these markets continue to show very strong demand dynamics leading to job growth, population growth, household formation trends. Those variables were present before COVID, and they were strong during COVID. And so as a consequence of that, I think that as you begin to think about how cap rates may change, I would argue that we may not see cap rates move up as much across a number of our markets as you might think. And we may -- and I would argue that they're not going to move up as much as you might see in other markets or other regions of the country because of the rent growth prospects and the demand dynamics that we are seeing that are so positive across this region of the country. And then to your other point about IRR, candidly, it's not something that we spend a lot of energy focusing on. Most of the modeling that we do is built on kind of a 10-year model. And to try to think about what an extra cap rate would be appropriate in 10 years from now is who knows. And what we're really looking to do is compare the opportunity to deploy capital, create a stabilized yield on that capital that is complementary to the existing yield. We're getting off the existing asset base and then also obviously look at it on an after-CapEx basis, so as we think about the opportunity to continue to grow the dividend. And as we look at an opportunity in front of us at the moment, certainly, the development continues to make a lot of sense. We're going to be very thoughtful and careful with that. As we've talked about in the past, we're not going to see our development pipeline get more than about 3% or so of our enterprise value. So, we're going to keep it at a very manageable level. But we have a lot of dry powder that we're keeping available at the moment because should the opportunity on the acquisition front really start to pick up and present itself in a big way, we'll be ready to jump on that and we've demonstrated in the past that a lot of value opportunity in that sort of focus. Well, broadly speaking, on the supply picture, I mean, what we see right now based on the data that we're looking at suggests that 2023 deliveries are going to be very comparable to what we saw in 2022. And actually based -- when you do an NOI-weighted analysis against our portfolio, it's actually down just slightly in 2023 versus 2022. So, I don't think that -- we're not sitting here today looking at numbers that suggest to us that we're going to see a big lift in the supply deliveries next year relative to what we've been experiencing for the last year or two, particularly last year or 2022, I should say. So we -- because of some of the challenges that we've seen with construction labor and materials and permitting and all that goes into predevelopment, we're just -- we just don't see supply likely picking up, broadly speaking, in a huge way next year in 2023 as compared to what we've experienced in 2022. The other thing that I will tell you, to your point, Alex, is, yes, I mean, I've heard about new supply worries for 28 years since I've been here. And it's -- and I will tell you, it's never been a problem. It can create some moderation here and there across the portfolio, given markets, given submarkets from time to time. But it's never been such an issue for us that we haven't been able to work through it. And one of the things that we've always done with our strategy is we work very hard to do what we can to mitigate some of the supply pressure it does occur from time to time. That's one of the reasons why we are diversified the way we are in both secondary as well as in large markets. We have a very affordable price point broadly in our portfolio. The new product coming in to the market is generally running 25%, 30% higher rents than what we are charging that creates some room for us, if you will, in terms of being able to weather that pressure, not only that, but also creates a tremendous opportunity on the redevelopment front. So we're -- as we sit here today, we are not particularly nervous about supply levels next year as we go into 2023. Well, it's hard to put a number on or quantify what additional financial benefits may come from scale. We feel like, frankly, at the point we are at the moment that we're fairly efficient in terms of what we're able to do. Certainly, put more assets against this existing platform, there's going to be at the margin, some additional opportunity that comes from that, but it's not something that we're candidly, actively trying to initiate, if you will, right now. For us, right, our focus really is the opportunity to drive increasing scale in a very disciplined fashion through the development effort that we have and through emerging opportunity for one-off acquisitions that we've done a lot of over the years. And we think that with our development pipeline headed towards $700 billion of active construction with emerging opportunities surrounding acquisitions that we think are likely to pick up more so next year, it puts us in a position to put together fairly meaningful levels of external growth that we think we can capture just through those processes that we have without the need to go out and do something more strategic in nature. We're always open to those ideas and we'll continue to monitor it, but it's not something that we feel compelling need to do in any way right now. And John, as I think you know, if it passes, it's only good for one year, and then they have to go through the process again. So again, we think that the downside risk to us is, frankly, fairly small in this topic. Rich, this is Eric. I would tell you, I mean, frankly, we think that our price point in the markets where we do business is exactly where we want to be. I wouldn't -- 7% above average, I wouldn't call a cream of the crop. Cream the crop is going to be to all the new stuff that's been built in the last two or three years, which is going to be 20% to 30% higher than the market average. If we had a portfolio of nothing. But that -- yes, I'd be more nervous about it. But what we typically see is a trade down from the really high-end product to our more affordable product to then go significantly below the market average, you start to get into a different submarket and you start to get into less amenities and you start to get into a product that is going to, I think, not be as appealing, if you will, to a lot of the resident profile that we serve. And I think that what we are likely to see if we find ourselves in a recession where people are really starting to think about how to lower their housing cost as you're going to see people in the very top end of the market doubling up in our properties. And I think that, that's what we've seen in the past and what we would likely see again if we found ourselves in a deep recession. No closing remarks. We appreciate everybody hanging with us this morning, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you over the next few weeks with upcoming conferences. Thanks a lot."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. Despite the challenges in the transaction market, the team continues to make good progress in executing our disposition plan for the year. In addition to the two Fort Worth properties we sold in the second quarter, we closed on the sale of a 396-unit community in Maryland earlier this month. We have one more disposition property located in the Austin market that we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Total expected proceeds for all four disposition remains at the midpoint of our guidance of $325 million with an NOI yield of 4.3%, generating a total expected IRR for these 25-year-old assets of 17.8%. The slowdown in transaction volume that started in the second quarter continued in the third quarter as dislocation in the capital markets increased over the quarter. Most buyers remain on the sidelines and with only a limited number of properties coming to market, price discovery will take some time. However, as we've seen in previous cycles, when deals begin to come to market, the evaluation of counter-party risks will drive decisions, with buyer financial strength and speed of execution being attractive key differentiators. During the third quarter, we were able to opportunistically use those strengths to close on two compelling newly constructed properties for a total of $213 million, generating an initial stabilized NOI yield of 4.7%, which we expect to increase further through our operating platform capabilities. These investments not only provide a higher immediate NOI yield than what we are selling, but they also give us more scale and higher demand, higher growth markets, where we expect to generate higher organic growth over the long term, especially on an after-CapEx basis. Due to their locations near other MAA communities, both investments also provide additional margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years. We continue to make progress in building out our development pipeline, while our under-construction pipeline remained at $444 million at the end of the third quarter. Earlier this month, we started construction on a $197 million, 495-unit project in Tampa, bringing our total active under-construction projects today to $641 million, representing 2,254 units. Predevelopment work is nearly complete on our Raleigh project, and we expect to start construction this quarter. With the scheduled completion of our Windmill Hill property in Austin, during the fourth quarter, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 2,310 units under construction at a total cost of $723 million. Also during the third quarter, we purchased a land parcel for a potential late 2023 start of a 500-unit development in the Denver, MSA. We now own seven and control five development sites with total entitlements in place for approximately 3,700 units. As we've indicated in previous quarters, the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes, but we are hopeful we can start a number of these projects over the next 18 months. Having said that, our balance sheet strength gives us the option to be patient and our construction timing, if it's warrant. Our disciplined approach to asset allocation, including site selection and land valuation will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment decision process. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressure surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules to help mitigate some of the potential cost escalation and schedule expansion that is prevalent in the market today, we are working with our contractors to make commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process. Today, our biggest challenges involve securing labor, obtaining cabinets and electrical components and securing building permits. Our team has been able to work around these issues on the majority of our projects to stay on schedule. In line with the performance of our overall portfolio, operating performance at our development communities in their initial lease-up is strong, with results at each community well ahead of our pro forma expectations. Demand remains strong and the competition from other new supply is not impacting our lease-up performance. During the third quarter, our Jefferson Sand Lake Community in Orlando reached stabilization and due predominantly to the strong rent performance, we expect our stabilized NOI yield to be between 7.8% and 8%, exceeding our original expectation by over 25%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So, I'll turn it over to Al. Yes. Hey Nick, this is Brad. I'd say we've certainly seen cap rates come up here in the third quarter as we've seen interest rates really rise very quickly. Now interest rates are regularly over 6%. We don't have a whole lot of data points frankly, in the third quarter. Second quarter, we commented we saw cap rates in the 37% range. For what we did see close in the third quarter, call it, 4.5% is really where we saw cap rates. But again, not a whole lot of trades there. And I would say that what we've seen -- for what has traded is there's been some characteristic about the property really that has allowed the buyer really to take advantage frequently of previous debt rates through loan assumptions, while taking advantage of the rent profile today. So, I would say that what has traded so far, in my opinion, is not reflective of where the market is going. Most of what we're hearing today is new assets that are being priced. BOVs are going out today 5% or more in terms of the cap rate. So, I would expect to see cap rates rise from where they are today. Where they shake out, that's hard to say. But given where interest rates are, over 6%, given where we are starting to see seasonality come back into play, which we did in last year. The appetite for a significant level of negative leverage from a buyer's perspective, I think that appetite is dissipating a bit. So, my sense is that we'll continue to see cap rates rise a bit next year. But I think it will be mid next year before we really start to see some transactions come to market and transactions to clear. So, I think it's going to take some time to really get visibility into what that looks like. Yes, I mean I'll back up and just start with, we have purposefully sat out of the acquisition market over the last couple of years. The last deal we purchased was in 2019 because really the spreads between development yield and acquisition cap rates had gotten really large over the last few years. So, we have purposefully focused our capital on development. Where we sit today with cap rates of 4.5%, perhaps moving up to 5%, I think you're going to get back to a more normal 100, 125, 150 basis point spread between cap rates and development yields. So, I think there'll need to be some movement going forward. And all of that is really dependent upon the quality of the development that you have where it's located, what the rent trajectory looks like on that asset. But clearly, I think for starts going into next year on the development side, I think you're likely to see a drop off in the construction starts. Developers, we obviously are active in the JV market partnering with developers. We are certainly hearing that equity partners on deals are backing out. Some of the pipeline, I think, is shrinking as you go forward from here because those yields do need to go up a bit. So, we're hopeful at this point that some of that starts to manifest itself through construction costs. But as you know, just like land costs, it's a little sticky. It takes time for that to manifest itself down into the cost, but we are certainly hopeful that yields expand a bit on the development pipeline. Yes. Well, I'll certainly talk about the external piece of that. As we sit here today, as I mentioned in my comments, we have really spent a lot of time developing our ability to deploy capital externally, both through acquisitions and development. And we are in a really good spot for that. We control, as I mentioned, 3,700 units, both owned and sites that we just have under contract. So, in the land basis of those, as I mentioned, we've been very disciplined in picking sites and we've lost out on sites because, one, the location wasn't the best location in a market and ones that are likely to stress more if things get a little bit shaky in the economy or the land price was too high. So, we feel really good about where we stand today in that regard. And so we have optionality on those projects given the size of our balance sheet. It's not a problem for us to continue to work those sites get to a point where we're ready to pull permits. And if the financing environment is such that it doesn't make sense for us to pull on those or our capital is better used in the acquisition market. We'll certainly lean into that. Just for perspective, in the acquisition side of things, after the last recession for a three-year period, 2010 to 2012, we executed on almost 10,000 units, single transactions, 9,500 units. And if we were able that similar type environment plays out over the next year, two years, three years. that's 10,000 units and at today's pricing even at a discount, that's $3 billion to $4 billion. And so that's what we're really preparing for is for an environment where we're able to execute on opportunities. It may or may not be that size of opportunities. But to your point, the amount of construction that started in 2020, 2021 in our region of the country was significant. And as you mentioned, the cost to refinance that, the cost to extend loans, banks are not going to be willing to do that. They want to clear these loans off their books at this point. So I think you will see, as you get into next year, a number of these merchant developers will need to transact. And I also think the basis of these developments that went under construction in 2020, 2021 still have profit in them. So, I do think a market will be made on these assets, and there will be an opportunity for us to step in and execute in that area. I'll start with that, and Eric can jump in if he needs to. The unlevered IRR on what we expect to sell this year is just under 13%. So still a really good IRR generated on those assets, which I'll also mention just, by the way, our 25-year-old assets to generate those IRRs. In terms of cap rate compression, yes, we've benefited from that over the last few years. And that will not obviously be the case going forward. But I think that's -- indicates really a healthy environment where we get back to the point where location of assets really matters, and that will drive the value of an asset. And I think that benefits us long term because I think we've got some of the best located assets in the best markets in our region of the country. And I think that differentiation between cap rates based on location and markets will absolutely benefit us as we go forward from here. Yes, this is Brad. Both of those are 5.5%, which is what we have been consistently underwriting recently. But I will say for both of these deals. We feel really, really good one, about the location of those assets. And then two, just about our ability to outperform that. As we -- I indicated in my comments, the outperformance on our recent Jefferson Sand Lake project. Certainly, that's a little bit different because of the cost basis, but there are some characteristics there that I think carry over to all of our developments. And number one is that we're very conservative in our rent growth projections on these assets significantly below what the market rent growth projections are over the first three or four years, which gives us a level of conservatism. Number two, I would say that as we expect over the next year or so, costs could come down on the construction side, which means we are less likely to dip into contingency and things of that nature on our projects. If we're able to save those expenses on these projects, that's a, call it, a 40 basis points improvement in yields on that. And then I would say the third thing is that our taxes that we have underwritten on these projects are reflective of today's valuation. So, to the extent we get some relief in that area. It's a lagging -- kind of a lagging item. But if we get some relief in that area, we also will see some relief on our expense pressure on the tax side. So we feel really good about where we've underwritten those assets and our ability to really improve the yields from the conservative numbers that we underwrote. Rich, this is Brad. I'll address the part of that, which is the current lease-up dynamics in the market. We're certainly not seeing pressure and struggles from the development community in terms of the lease-up performance of assets that are in lease-up. I mean our -- the five properties that we have right now that are in lease-up, if they're an example the lease-up velocity continues to be very, very strong. And those are the products, by the way, that are competing directly with the new supply in the market. velocities are strong. Traffic is still very good in our markets. And then the rents on those assets continue to outperform. So if that's a proxy for what we're seeing in the market, we're just not seeing in our region of the country struggling fundamentals yet even on the new development side. So, we're not seeing developers under pressure, fire selling their -- or leasing their properties and offering multiple months concessions. We're not seeing that at this point. Everybody is pretty disciplined. The fundamentals still appear to be very, very strong in the lease-up properties. This is Brad. I would say that's probably a little higher. I mean I think what developers are generally trying to solve for is return on cost, a year one return on cost on their development, similar to what we're looking at on a stabilized yield. But those are trending up to over 6% at this point. I think aside from construction costs, really what the developers have been hit with is interest rates have gone from call it, 3.5%, 4% and now they're probably double that. So, their interest expense have gone up tremendously on their projects. Really, in the -- from the underwriting perspective because of the seasonality we're seeing that didn't see earlier this year, I suspect when they go back in at this point, and get construction cost price updates they may not increase quite as much as they have been, but their rent growth when they update those at this point is showing seasonality. So their yields are probably under pressure from that. And then also just the interest expense line item. So, developments, I was at a conference last week with quite a few developers in their is a general sense that most projects at this point that are not kicked off really are being pushed out. Land timing is being pushed out. Projects are being shelved at this point. So, I think there's just a broad recalibration going on in the market. And it's hard to say what developers are looking for in the private side, but it's definitely higher than what it has been and it's going to be somewhere return on cost in the six to mid-6% range, I suspect. Yes, this is Brad. So we've got, as I mentioned earlier, a number of properties between four to six that we can start next year. Those will probably be weighted mid to late next year is my sense. So we've got a little bit of time on those really to kind of figure out where the market is. And frankly, just to see if there's some reset on the construction cost side of these projects. So we've got some time under our belt from that. But as I mentioned in my comments, we have the ability to be patient on those. -- and the discipline that we use to help us find sites and really underwriting our deals will also be the same discipline that we use in determining when we -- when is the right time to start construction on these assets. So, I'd say it's a little early right now to tell if that will push off at all. We do have the ability both from a timing perspective and then just also the balance sheet capacity to be able to hold those assets if we need to those land assets. Yes, I mean, land is probably the last component to adjust if there's an adjustment on the development side. construction costs, that takes a little while to manifest itself into the cost of the project and then land is the last thing that adjusts. And at this point, we're not really seeing any adjustment in land prices, and it will just take some time to really see if there's anything to that."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.19 was $0.12 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. About $0.75 or $0.9 of the outperformance came from revenues, stronger than expected rental pricing trends continued into the quarter, producing 14.6% same-store revenue growth, which was over 200 basis points above our expectation. Remaining core FFO per share outperformance primarily came from overhead and other non-operating items during the quarter, which were slightly favorable to expectations. Same-store operating expense growth for the third quarter was impacted by continued inflationary pressures as well as a challenging prior year comparison. If you recall, operating expenses grew only 1.5% during the third quarter of last year. Real estate taxes made up the biggest portion of the variance from our expectations for the third quarter this year. We received a significant amount of information during the quarter, particularly in Florida, reflecting some pressure in both values and millers rates as compared to our expectations. We will continue to aggressively challenge values where we can, but we now expect our real estate tax expense to be at the higher end of our previous range. Revised guidance for the year discussed more in a moment, reflects these expense pressures, but they continue to be more than offset by the strong revenue performance. Our balance sheet remains stronger than ever, providing both protection and opportunity as we move through this volatile market environment. In August, we received an upgrade from S&P to an A- credit rating. We're now rated A- by both S&P and Fitch and continue to have positive discussions with Moody's, which we believe will eventually lead to an upgrade. We also completed the early renewal of our unsecured credit facility at very attractive pricing levels during the quarter, and upside facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion despite a challenging financing market. In addition, we expanded the size of our commercial paper program from $500 million to $625 million to reflect the increase in our credit facility. These two programs provide significant low-cost and flexible capital development program and our future capital needs. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.2 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity available. Our leverage remains historically low. Net debt adjusted EBITDA rate of only 3.97 times. Our debt balances also have significant protection from rising interest rates, as over 97% of our debt is fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with an average maturity of eight years. Finally, given the third quarter outperformance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.20 per share at the midpoint to a range of $8.37 and $8.53 per share or $8.45 at the midpoint, which now represents a 21% growth over the prior year. This increase is primarily a result of higher revenue growth as the strong pricing trends continued into the third quarter with the projected impact of prior year comparisons and seasonal trends coming later than originally projected. We now expect same-store revenue growth for the year to be 13.5% at the midpoint, primarily driven by 125 basis points increase and our effective rent growth expectation for the year over our previous guidance. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy were growing impact from prior year comps and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. We're now seeing the beginning of this impact, albeit a few months later than originally projected. We expect average blended lease pricing to be in the 7% to 8% range for the fourth quarter, which for context is on top of a record high 16% growth captured in the fourth quarter of last year. We also narrowed the expected range for same-store operating expenses for the full year, effectively increasing the midpoint by 25 basis points from last year's guidance -- from last quarter's guidance, excuse me, primarily reflecting the pressure from real estate taxes that I mentioned earlier. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our same-store NOI growth guidance for the year by 200 basis points to a midpoint of 17%. So, that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Riesa. We'll now turn the call back over to you for questions. I'll just follow-up that the forecast that we've put out does imply a 7% to 8% blended for the fourth quarter. You're right, we don't expect it to move much, number one. And remember, there's -- most of the leases have been signed in the second and third quarter already anyway. Yes, this is Al. I can touch on that. So as we talked about, really in our portfolio, Texas, Florida and even Georgia, they are the primary areas of our taxes and our pressure that we've been saying together. They're somewhere around probably a little bit over two-thirds of our tax cost. And the primary pressure comes from Texas and Florida that you just mentioned. And so for the full year, that certainly we're looking at Texas is probably a little over half of that two-thirds. So, you see the significance there. We spend a lot of time working on challenging the values as we talked about when we're from informal to formal. So a lot of pressure on that. I think -- and so -- the change this quarter though was really about information coming in, in Florida. We got a lot of information late and they typically do that and it caused us to believe that the values were a little higher than we thought they were going to be in Florida and the miller rates so we're seeing rollbacks not quite what we're expecting. So, I would say that in general, across the portfolio, we talked about high assessments with rollbacks, that's still occurring. And we are seeing that occur, not quite what we'd expected that caused that increase that we put in the guidance. As we look into next year, I think it's important to think about there's two main components you got to look at one -- it's obviously a backward-looking process. And so you're going to have one positive impact maybe the change in cap rate environment that we talked about that this morning. But the other side is they're looking at a really strong top line revenue growth this year when they set the values. So both those coming together, what we would say is as we look forward next year probably looks a lot like this year with maybe a little bit of upward bias because of that strong revenue performance. But as we move into 2024, and pass some of the comments Brad was saying on the acquisitions and development, you would expect that the things settle down and we make a little bit of moderation at that point because of the stabilized cap rate and rent growth environments. I think we moved that, Rob, we certainly do that each quarter as we look at it. And just really, I think it would be something significant occupancy really at this point. I mean I think -- or some unforeseen item that we didn't anticipate. So I think to your point, -- the rent pricing that is the biggest piece is pretty certain and depending on -- excuse me, performance is pretty certain. Even if the pricing moves around from that expectation on the tip of the spear, the few leases in the fourth quarter, so that would have a less impact. It would have to be something in occupancy or in significant surprise in expenses. We don't expect that. And we did continue to narrow our range showing that there's a little more certainty, but I just felt that was prudent to leave that at that level. We're -- you saw in the release, we had -- in the third quarter, we incurred about $1.6 million of expenses for that. We were very fortunate in our portfolio there. I think had minimal impact from that. We'll have some cleanup costs and some water intrusion and some roofing things. But expense incurred $1.6 million which you saw it's not -- it's in -- it's in operating expenses outside of same store. You see that disclosed in the press release. We'll have a little bit more capital items. But together, the cost are going to be pretty significant. We are very fortunate. We're -- I'll let Rob talk about the details if he wants to. But we have very good performance really going all the way back to COVID. The biggest spread was worse point about 200 basis points of delinquency. We have been, for the last several quarters, very good, though we've almost our normal long-term range, which is about 40 to 50 basis points. We call it 60 to 70 basis points now. So we've been performing very well, not quite to where we were pre-COVID but certainly performing very well."

            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. We saw broad-based strength and pricing performance across the portfolio. During the third quarter, with blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved up 13.9%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the third quarter was 16.7% versus the prior year and 5.6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Based on our forecast for in-place rents at the end of 2022, we expect our earned in or baked in rent growth for 2023 to be in the 6% range before considering any new rent growth that may occur in 2023. Alongside the robust pricing performance, average daily occupancy for the quarter remained strong at 95.8%. We have continued to achieve pricing better than our previous expectations in the early part of the fourth quarter with blended lease-over-lease pricing for October to date at a very seasonally strong 8.3%. Average physical occupancy for October to date is in line with expectations at 95.7%. Additionally, on average, we are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 10% for the fourth quarter. Despite projections that supply will likely remain elevated in 2023, that we think at similar levels to 2022, various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our region of the country to continue to benefit from population, household and job growth. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program and our installation of smart home technology that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and door locks as well as leak detection monitoring. In addition, our broader amenity based and more extensive property repositioning program continues to make great progress. The value to residents provided by these programs can be particularly impactful when new supply is being delivered into the market. On average, we are seeing new development being delivered in our markets with monthly rents that are $350 or about 22% higher than the average rent of our current portfolio. This helps drive the value opportunity associated with our repositioning programs. For the third quarter, we completed 2,305 interior unit upgrades and installed 652 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, leases have been repriced at the first eight properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another eight projects that are currently in various stages of construction and unit repricing. Those are all in my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad. Well, Neil, this is Tim. We talked about the 6% sort of earned in that we think we have next year. If you look at kind of -- I think the question you're probably asking is sort of where our rents sit today here in September compared to are all in place rents that's roughly 3.5% from where we sit today. Austin, this is Tim. The market rent growth we've seen to date is about 7% or so, when you strip out sort of the baked in and everything else. It's hard to say that we expect rent growth next year to be at the level that we've seen this year, which certainly has been between this year and 2021 then record levels. But as Eric laid out a little bit ago, we don't see in the near-term, anything changing too much from the demand standpoint, supply kind of is what it is, like we talked about. So, we think we're still in a period where we can see some better than average, if you will, but likely not to the extent we're seeing the last 12 months or so. So, as we said, the October new lease is 5.7%, renewal is 10.7% and the comment we did make around the rest of the year as we're seeing on the renewal side, somewhere around that 10% for what we've signed so far. Nick, this is Tim. Yes, we're at the 15% for Q3 for sort of move-ins from non-M&A states. That's been pretty consistent. It's kind of range from that 14% to 16% sort of range back to the beginning of 2021 or so. And so we're seeing it consistent. It's coming primarily from New York and California, some of that makes sense given they're the largest states. But particularly some of the markets that are benefiting are Dallas, Tampa, Nashville, Charleston, Phoenix, Savannah. Those are the largest ones, and that's been pretty consistent. And we are seeing our -- the quality of resident, if you will, and the income levels have been pretty strong. Our rent-to-income ratio stay consistent now for the last couple of years, around 22%. So, we are seeing more sort of professionals, finance and tech and that sort of thing coming into our markets. It's hard to say. We haven't seen any big significant changes that we've noticed at the property level. It's a little bit hard to tell, but I think it's -- there's certainly some, but not -- probably not quite to the level we saw like a year or so ago. Yes. To point out a couple, we think we'll be on the higher side, likely are Austin and Charlotte would be a couple and Austin's a pretty interesting test case. It's had high supply now for a few years in a row. Expect that to continue, but it also ranks at the top in terms of job growth, in migration, household formation, population. So I think to the extent that demand side stays where it is. We don't -- despite that supply, we don't think it will have a significant impact. Dallas is one where supply has been pretty light, and we've seen that market come on pretty strong over the last few months. We think Dallas is one that can that can perform pretty well. The rest of the markets, it's pretty evenly spread, but also in Charlotte being the two that we'll probably keep our eye on a little more. So, the loss release of 3.5%, the way that is calculated is basically just looking at the rents we did in September that went into effect in September as compared to all in-place rents right now, and that's 3.5%. And so we typically see that number. That's calculated in that way. It's going to be the highest in the summer when rents are strongest and the seasonality is the strongest. It will come down a little bit as you get into the fall and likely into the winter, assuming you're seeing that normal seasonality. So that -- in my opinion, that number is pretty volatile. I mean it's going to move around. And that's why one of the points we're making is with where we expect December to be in all of our in-place rents that will be there in December, if you just carry that through to 2023 and assume we don't get any more rent growth, you get to 6%. So to me, that's -- in terms of trying to figure out what it's going to do to impact 2023, that's kind of why we focus on that 6%. Hey, this is Tim. Not necessarily. I mean we look obviously at the move-outs to home buying and that sort of thing, and it's become a much smaller piece of our turnover, and that's pretty consistent across the market. So with the recent move up in interest rates, I think that probably continues even if with prices have gone down, interest rates have gone up. So the total cost is not any less than it really was before. So right now, we're not seeing any change from what we've been seeing. Yes, we're not seeing traffic has been up across the board in pretty much all of our markets. We're not seeing any of the kind of doubling up. Our average occupant per unit is the same, whether you're looking at efficiencies, one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, three-bedrooms. So we're not seeing enough phenomenon of people trying to double up or anything like that. So, as of right now, all the trends that we look at for that kind of thing have been pretty consistent. Rich, I'll add one point to that. The areas we're actually doing some unit interior renovates this year and the ones we're looking at for next year, it's actually a little bit wider debt kind of in that 25% to 27% range on the comps we're looking at. And we're not looking to get to that rent. We're -- as you know, we're kind of usually getting in that 9% to 10% range. So still creates that gap that we think we can execute on. Just one point there, Rob, to is just our current resident receivable balance is about September 30 is about $5 million compared to $5.3 million at June 30. So kind of as Al said, I mean, trending down in the right direction. Yes, there is a little bit of supply chain issues there and getting -- there's a couple of different models out there and kind of getting some of the new ones in that we think will happen in the fourth quarter. We had preplanned everything we did in the first couple of quarters, which is why it was skewed that way, but we expect to get a little more normal time line here in the fourth quarter and then certainly into 2023 as well. Not necessarily. I mean I will say, actually, if you look at our blended pricing for Q3 more of our B-style assets or which you might consider the B assets in our portfolio actually did a little bit better in terms of blended pricing. So we're not seeing our existing portfolio. The turnover was a little higher in some of our secondary markets that have some B assets, but we're also replacing those with residents where the rent to income ratio has not changed. So I think to the extent we are seeing it here and there, we're able to quickly replace it with residents that have that strong affordability. No, like I said, in the secondary markets, the pricing performance has been pretty strong and the B type asset has been pretty strong. I mean, we are seeing some moderation. Most of it's driven by seasonality. Phoenix is one that's moderated a little bit, but it has had a really strong rent growth now for two to three years straight. But the demand fundamentals, as we talked about, are really strong. Supply kind of is what it is at a similar level. But outside of Houston and D.C., which we talked about, have been a little bit weaker markets, all the other ones are hanging in pretty consistently with what they've been doing. No. The 5.7 was the new lease rate in October. Renewals were 10.6. We've not seen any lag or any reduction in leasing traffic. We talked about our traffic in Q3 was up, our leads are up. So the seasonality will just be relative to Q2 and Q3, yes, traffic will be lower and leads will be lower than what we see in those quarters, but no different than we typically expect to see in the winter season. So there's nothing to indicate anything different other than as we've talked about, I do think the seasonal or the normal seasonality returns more so this year, certainly that we did not see last year. What trend, you kind of cut out there for a second. I think we just talked about a moment ago, I think we've had a very good performance in our bad debt. Our delinquencies for really the last year, 1.5 years. So I think we're a little above in delinquency. Our long-term rate, which is really low 40 to 50 basis points of rents historically, we call it, 60, 70 basis points range, but still very strong. Don't see an indication that says that's changing today or expect that change as we move into fourth quarter next year. We haven't seen any indications that are more transient. I mean if you -- or certainly more transient to move back out of our footprint. We've talked about the move-ins from out of footprint, bringing in that 15% range now for a while. The move back out of our footprint is 5% has been that way for a long time. So we don't see any trends that they're moving back to where they came from, so to speak, and haven't seen any significant trends and types of turnover, anything like that. So no indications of it. It was -- I would say, pre-COVID at range in that 9% to 10% range. So we have seen it pick up some, but it has now remained consistent, like we said for the last two or three years. And you're talking about just of our move in. So, when you think about the number of units with turnover and all that, it's a relatively -- it's significant in terms of it's picked up, but it's still -- it's not driving the bulk of our demand or the bulk of our outperformance. Yes, we are testing and looking at some, if you want call it, pods or whatever, where we have some oversight roles at managing multiple properties, particularly ones that are within close proximity and with the new CRM we have in place that's helped enable that. And there's some other things we're looking at that will help enable that. But yes, and we talked about that a little bit on the last call. That's something that we're actively engaged in right now."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Gretchen, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the -- Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Leasing conditions remained strong across our Sunbelt portfolio, job growth, positive migration trends and the higher cost of single-family home ownership continue to fuel strong demand roughly halfway through the busy leasing season, we do not see any indication that demand is slowing. Leasing traffic or leads were up 11% in the second quarter as compared to prior year generating a 7% jump in lease applications, new move-ins during the quarter from households migrating into our Sunbelt footprint increased slightly from last year and drove 15% of our new move-ins. Further supporting the strength of the leasing market and the prospects for continued rent growth, it's worth noting that the rent-to-income ratio of the new leases executed in the second quarter was 22%, it remains in a very affordable range. Collections also remained strong with 99.5% of the rent build in the second quarter collected, which is actually up slightly from 99.4% collected in the preceding first quarter. Al will touch on this and while we see no near-term indications that leasing conditions are poised to change and we expect the strong occupancy and rent growth trends to continue, we do anticipate that we'll see some year-over-year moderation in rent growth over the back half of the year as the prior year performance comparisons become more difficult. But current rent levels continue to hold up well and are increasingly fueling solid revenue momentum for the start of the next calendar year. Pressure on operating expenses from the competitive labor market, inflationary and supply chain pressures and real estate taxes continued in the second quarter. We expect these pressures will likely persist over the balance of the year with some relief beginning in 2023 as we begin to harvest increasing benefits from our new tech and margin expansion initiatives. On balance, given the strong top line performance, our NOI margin continues to expand. And as noted in our earnings release, we, once again, increased our expectations for growth in same-store net operating income for the year. We are seeing increasing opportunity within the transaction market and are very pleased with our Tampa property acquisition completed earlier this month. This new property acquisition is actually located directly adjacent to 1 of our existing properties providing an opportunity to consolidate on-site operations to drive a very attractive investment return. Our new development pipeline continues to expand as we continue to find attractive opportunities to drive value and yields well above our overall cost of capital. Our pipeline of existing construction projects remains on budget, and our lease-up projects are outperforming our pro formas. We remain very encouraged by the current leasing conditions and the early momentum in key variables that will define calendar year 2023's initial performance. There are, of course, growing concerns surrounding the broader economy and concerns surrounding a potential recession. Should we find ourselves facing a weaker economic backdrop later this year or in 2023, we believe that MAA is very well positioned for such an environment. First, we believe that the well diversified and more affordable nature of our markets will continue to enable our Sunbelt portfolio to better weather an economic slowdown as compared to other regions. MAA's balance sheet and coverage ratios are very strong and better than at any point in our company's history. We continue to introduce new technology and changes to our operating practices that will drive more efficiency and higher margins over the next couple of years. MAA has had a established performance record of responding well to down cycles, and I'm confident that we will again demonstrate that resilience, should we find ourselves in such an environment. Meanwhile, our outlook remains positive, and current leasing conditions are very strong. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Transaction activity in the second quarter slowed meaningfully from the first quarter of the year as the increase in interest rates coupled with a higher degree of economic uncertainty have combined Ascend Buyers with shorter investment time horizons as well as buyers using higher leverage to the sidelines. Unlike previous quarters, we saw a number of properties fall out of contract in the second quarter. For the properties that did close, generally, they closed with stronger institutional quality investors at cap rates that were 40 basis points higher than where deals traded in the first quarter. As the uncertainty in the market has risen, our ability to move quickly and close all cash has led to a significant increase in inbound calls to our transaction team. As Eric mentioned, in July, we successfully acquired a newly constructed property in the Tampa MSA. This 196-unit property is adjacent to an existing MAA property and will be fully integrated into our existing property, creating operational efficiencies and margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years. Our under construction and in lease-up pipeline remains at $740 million. While we had no construction starts in the second quarter, we did purchase a land parcel for a planned 2023 start of a 300-unit development in Orlando. Also, subsequent to quarter end, we purchased a 500-unit development site in the Denver MSA that we also expect to start construction on in 2023. These land purchases bring our owned land sites for development to 8 sites with entitlements for approximately 2,677 units. We previously expected to start construction on our sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver this year, but we've pushed the start of our Denver project to 2023. Predevelopment work on our Raleigh and Tampa projects are progressing and subject to receiving acceptable construction costs and the appropriate building permits, we still expect to start construction on these projects this year. We continue predevelopment work on several additional in-house and prepurchase developments located in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando and Salt Lake City that we hope to start over the next 18 months. The timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes but at this time, we expect to start construction on approximately 1,250 units this year, and we expect to end the year with a pipeline of under construction projects over $700 million and pipeline of projects both under construction and in lease-up between $925 million and $975 million. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressures surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall job cost. To avoid the cost escalation that is so prevalent in the market today, we are making commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process than we've had to in the past. Nevertheless, delivery delays, material shortages and securing building permits remain our biggest challenges. In our supplemental, we did push back by 1 quarter, our expected delivery dates on Novel Val Vista in Phoenix and Central Park in Denver. Operating performance at communities in their initial lease-up continues to strengthen, traffic and leads remain elevated, leading to rents well ahead of our pro forma expectations at all of our lease-up communities. Due to the strong leasing performance achieved by our property team at MAA Westland, we moved up our expected stabilization date by 1 quarter to third quarter of '22. As mentioned in our release, we successfully sold our 2 disposition properties in the Fort Worth market for $167 million. We have 2 more planned disposition properties in the market that we hope to close late this year. One is in Suburban Maryland, and one is in the Austin market. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Grimes: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again robust, and our busy summer season is going well. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 17.2%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased by 14.3% on a year-over-year basis and 4% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver and with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.7. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. During the quarter, we completed 1,844 interior unit upgrades and installed 9,438 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first 8 properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another 8 projects that are underway this year. Strong leasing activity continues for July. Same-store lease-over-lease pricing on new move-ins as of July 25, is 17.9% ahead of the rent of the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July is running 15.4% of the prior lease and as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16.6% thus far in July. Same-store physical occupancy as of July 25 was 95.9. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations. Our teams have performed well during our busy summer season and have the portfolio well positioned for the slower fall and winter seasons. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Al.\nAl Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.02 was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. The outperformance virtually all came from property revenues and stronger than projected rental pricing trends continued through the quarter, which produced a strong 17.2% increase in blended lease pricing for the quarter even as more challenging prior year comparisons began to grow late in the quarter. We do continue to expect a growing impact from prior comps as we move through the back half of the year as well as a return of a more normal seasonal pattern during the fourth quarter, which we'll discuss just a bit more  guidance in a moment. Same-store operating expenses for the quarter were slightly higher than projected as we saw some inflationary pressures and repair maintenance costs as well as revised expectations for real estate tax expenses for the year as more valuation information came in during the quarter. Our revised guidance for the year reflects these expense pressures, but these are more than offset by growing revenues as reflected by our revised NOI guidance. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever as reflected by the upgrade to an A- credit rating by Fitch during the quarter. We continue to have discussions with the other agencies and are confident the strength will eventually be reflected in our other ratings as well. Just after the end of the quarter, we completed a renewal of our unsecured credit facility, which is our primary tool for liquidity and short-term funding of development, debt maturities and short-term operating needs. As part of the renewal, we increased the facility size to $1.25 billion from $1 billion and capture improvements in pricing and terms despite the growing volatility of the financing markets. At the end of the quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and our leverage was historically low with debt to EBITDA at a low 3.97x and 100% of our debt had fixed interest rates with an average maturity of 8.2 years, providing potential in a rising interest rate environment. And finally, given the second quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.17 per share or 2% at the midpoint to a range of $8.13 to $8.37 per share or $8.25 at the midpoint. This now represents a 17.5% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all the result of higher revenue growth, strong price intends continued through the second quarter, as we mentioned, we're now projecting a 125 basis points increase in our effective rent growth expectation for the year to 13.25% at the midpoint. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some growing impact from prior year comps for the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter, as we mentioned. We expect blended lease pricing to be approximately 8% for the second half of the year, which for context is on top of a record high 15% growth in blended pricing captured in the back half of last year. So I think this reflects our expectation for continued strong demand in our markets. As mentioned, we also increased the expected growth rate for same-store operating expenses for the full year by 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, now 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, primarily reflecting the pressure in repair and maintenance costs as well as real estate taxes. Property valuations received during the quarter, mainly in Texas, reflected aggressive assessments, and we do expect these valuation increases to be partially offset by millage rate rollbacks finalized late in the year, but we increased our expectation for taxes by 100 basis points for the full year to reflect the net impact. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our expectations for same-store NOI growth for the year to a midpoint of 15%, up from the 13.5% provided at the end of the first quarter. And this represents a 170 basis point expansion in our margin in 2022 from the prior year. So other changes to guidance of note were a $50 million reduction in our expected development spending for the year, reflecting really revised timing of funding as well as a $25 million reduction in our gross disposition proceeds as we finalized the sale of the 2 remaining properties in Maryland in Austin. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Gretchen we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Obviously, rents have been moving up, but appreciate the affordability stats that you provided for the new move-ins. But for the existing portfolio, obviously, you don't kind of requalify them off of income. But are you seeing anything change in terms of move-outs because rent is too high? Or any other kind of commentary on affordability of the existing portfolio would be helpful.\nTom Grimes: Yes. Nick, I'll jump in there. I mean I think looking at a few different fronts, but collections improved to 99.5 from 99.4, which is encouraging. Our unit types, we're not seeing a flight to efficiencies and our efficiency 1s, 2s and 3s are performing consistently. Our headcount units has moved from 1.7 heads to  on that. So it really seems to be moving steadily. I mean we are pushing rates, and we do see a tick-up in move-outs to rent increase. But again, we're moving those folks back in at 22%. So it's pretty steady as it goes, Nick.\nNicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And then as you think about the pricing trends, I guess, year-to-date, but also your expectations in the back half of the year. What does that start to look at in terms of the earn-in for next year in 2023?\nTim Argo : Yes, Nick, this is Tim. I'll hit that one. So thinking about the earn-in. The way we typically think about that is our full year blended lease-over-lease for this year, call it, somewhere around half of that, we would expect to blend into 2023. So If you think about the forecast that we laid out there in the 8% back half of the year, blended lease-over-lease that comes out to about somewhere 12%, 12.5% blended lease-over-lease is what we're expecting for full year 2022. So call it, somewhere about 6% earn-in as we sit here today.\nNicholas Joseph: And how does that compare to kind of the history of earnings?\nTim Argo : It's certainly the highest we've ever had. I think going back to 2020, it was 0 last year, I think it was about 3% or so, so certainly the highest we've seen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Eric, you transformed the portfolio for more of a classic focus to a more diversified price point. Should we give an update on what percentage of your portfolio Class A versus Class B? And what part you were able to perform better in consumer recession?\nTom Grimes: John, you're really fragmented. And I think the first question was what's the balance between A and B assets as we look on that?\nTim Argo : Yes. Between A and B, it's roughly 50-50. I mean there are some nuances between what we would call A plus A and B and B plus I would talk about 50-50 or so.\nJohn Kim: And the second part was what do you think will perform better if we head into recession?\nEric Bolton: Well, John, this is Eric. I think that broadly speaking, across our markets and our footprint, I mean, we see that our product is pretty for but that rent-to-income ratio that we see between the As and Bs is pretty consistent across the portfolio. Our collections performance is still consistent across the portfolio. So I think that trying to think that the Bs will maybe do a little bit better than As in a downturn just because it's a slightly more affordable product. But honestly, I don't think there's going to be a huge difference if we find ourselves in a downturn of some sort, I think it becomes more a question about markets that you're in. And employment base, employment diversification. And certainly, I do think that a slightly more affordable product probably holds up a little bit better. But across our Sunbelt markets, we think that broadly, the whole region will just do a little bit better in a downturn as it has historically always in prior downturns.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And my second question is on expenses. You've seen some inflationary pressure expenses higher than your coastal peers. And I realize some of that is just real state taxes. But you made a similar type of investment in technology as you  and had. So I'm wondering if you could comment on the expense guidance going up this quarter.\nTom Grimes: John, you were really broken there something about inflation and expense guidance.\nAl Campbell: I think he said also in real estate taxes --\nJohn Kim:  increase on the expense guidance --\nAl Campbell: I think a couple of things, and I'll start with this, Tom, and please jump in here. But on the guidance on that, and John, you were broken up, but I think you're asking that. And it's 2 things primarily, which  up a bit. And then real estate taxes, which is obviously almost 40% of our expenses, that's a real big driver of that. And for that picture, particularly, we started the year with no information really, put out our best estimates of it. And we saw the valuations come in higher. They're pretty aggressive as they're coming in particularly from Texas. As we mentioned, we do expect rate rollbacks or millage rate rollbacks come in for a large part of that as it progresses. But we get those late in the year, so it's hard to get a picture of that. And we'll certainly continue to fight like we do every year and we'll formally litigate over half of our Texas portfolio. So that's really the tax pressure. And Tom, you might want to give color on if you have any, but that's out, repair maintenance and taxes both in the quarter and I would say in the guidance as well as one for the back part of the year, probably tilting a little more toward taxes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: I was curious if you could talk about the plan for the $200 million in equity forwards that were sold last year, I know they need to be settled by February of next year, but it doesn't really seem like there's an obvious need for the capital, especially with leverage below the target range and likely moving lower?\nAl Campbell: Yes, I think that's a great question. I mean you hit that right, we have the Ford outstanding to, I think, February of next year. We don't have immediate plans to draw on that, but I think our expectations are between now and then to draw that to help fund the remaining development expectations for this year and as we go into next year. So we certainly don't need to take our leverage lower, but it is a part of our funding over the longer term that we think is important.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. And are you guys' comfortable running at sort of like mid- to high 3x leverage or is there a desire to maybe ramp up development or do some net acquisition activity that fuel to get that leverage number back into the 4s?\nAl Campbell: I'll give the leverage target and maybe add Brad and Eric will talk on the other parts of the strategy, but we're a little below our range right now. I mean, we've talked about for the last couple of quarters, we always are working to add strength to the business in every area. So on our balance sheet, we're very strong right now. Our leverage is historically low debt to EBITDA may touched 3.97%. That's below. I think we would -- Andrew and I would say between 4% to 5% is probably preferred. 4.5%, you certainly wouldn't want to get above 5% in our current credit ratings. So we're below where we need to be. We believe that's opportunity, both as protection and opportunities. So as we move into this recession and some opportunities come up for Brad and the team, we want to give them that flexibility to do that.\nBrad Hill: Brad, this is Brad Hill. I think certainly, we've talked about over the last few quarters, the vision and the plan to grow our development pipeline, and we're certainly on pace to do that as I laid out in my comments and what Al has done with the balance sheet and the really optionality that he has provided us with to be able to do that is there. And I would say just on the acquisition side, certainly, we're keeping our eyes open in that area. And like past disruptions in the market, we've been able to really take advantage of those within our footprint, we have focused on the Sunbelt region of the country for the last 28 years. So we know that region of the country. We certainly have executed both on a transaction side and then operating side for the last 28 years there do all parts of the cycle. So what Al is doing with the balance sheet puts us in a great position to be able to execute on some opportunities, which are likely to manifest themselves during this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So Eric, I'm just curious if you are concerned at all that if we do get sort of an economic slowdown if the migration trends that you've referenced for a couple of years, begin to soften further, perhaps you've had a little bit of a pull forward in demand in recent years. And when you kind of marry that with the fact that the under-construction pipeline in many Sunbelt markets is up. So just curious kind of how you think about that versus maybe the setup for the portfolio and ahead of any prior downturns?\nEric Bolton: Well, Austin, our long-term approach to this business and strategy has long been based on a notion of trying to position for the full cycle, both the down part of the cycle and the up part of the cycle. And we have long believed that the way to do that is to focus on markets where we think that job growth, population growth is likely to be the best over time, over the full cycle, which has caused us to continue to retain our focus on these Sunbelt markets. In an effort to take further cyclicality out of our performance. The other thing that we've intentionally done over the years is that we have purposely been very diversified across the region as well as differentiated capital allocation between large markets as well as some of the select secondary markets of the region as well. And as was touched on earlier, we tend to have a price point in our portfolio that appeals to the broadest segment of the rental market. We don't do the sort of the low end or the super high end. We averaged kind of right in the middle. So we're appealing, if you will, to the largest segment of the rental market. So all that to say that our strategy, we think, has continued to serve us very well for a long time. The migration trends that we've talked about over the last couple of years, of course, they were evident there prior to COVID and move-ins from outside the Sunbelt into our footprint prior to COVID, we're running somewhere around 9%. And now it's up to -- of our move-ins, 9% of our move-ins were coming from people moving into the Sunbelt. Now it's up to 15% of our move-ins are coming from people to Sunbelt. So a long way of saying, while certainly there's been a trend of migration that has worked in our favor. It's not like it's been huge. It's not 50% of our move-ins or something of that nature. It's gone from 9% to 15%. So I think that particular variable of move-ins migration trends, if you will, helpful hasn't been as significant as sometimes what I think depressed and others to make it out as when you read what's going on nationally. Beyond that, I will just tell you that I think in a recessionary environment, if we find ourselves in such a scenario, I think that the diversification of the employment base, the employers, the affordability of the region that we have in the Sunbelt, I think all continues to work in our favor. And we think that today, we very much retain our defensive characteristics that would be helpful to have should we find ourselves in a downturn.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's a thoughtful answer. And then just curious about sort of the acquisition opportunities. I mean you were fairly upbeat when we spoke in REIT. You seem to still be fairly upbeat today and certainly have the balance sheet to fund if the opportunities emerge. But can you size up just what the pipeline looks like today or what you think you can really capitalize on? And then what the negotiations are like for cap rates in your markets versus maybe where it was 6 to 12 months ago?\nBrad Hill: Yes. Austin, this is Brad. In terms of cap rates, as I mentioned in my comments, there's definitely been a movement in the last 2 to 3 months. But that movement is very different based on the asset quality, the asset location. And just to keep in mind, really the assets that we're looking at is just a segment of the assets that are out there. I mean we're looking at well-located assets, brand-new assets, high-quality assets. And so what we've seen there is about a 40 basis points change in the cap rates. And what we've also seen, though, is we look at the assets that traded in the second quarter, every asset that traded went to a high-quality institutional capital. So we're seeing buyers certainly flock to high-quality assets, and we're also seeing sellers flock to high-quality buyers. And that's where, in the past, when the markets have changed, where we've been able to find our opportunities through our execution capabilities and through just our 28-year history in the markets that we're in. So as we sit here today, we are getting more calls on acquisitions than we've ever received, frankly, to look at assets that either are fell out of contract or they're just taking to a couple of folks that they know can close the assets. So we're getting a lot of look at assets. And then I think just from an underwriting perspective, the deals within our region of the country just continue to perform extremely well, which leads us to believe that from a performance standpoint, these assets, again, that are very high quality will continue to perform. And I do think that the assets that are coming to market that we're looking at are likely to trade. You mentioned cap rates today versus a year ago. Well, cap rates today on what we're looking at are a 3.7. A year ago, they were 3.8. So we're still under kind of where we were a year ago. So although there's been some recent movement, interest rates went up in the second quarter, they're back down a bit. You can get a 10-year rate right now in the 3%, 4%, 5% range. So there appears to be on the assets that we are bidding against a floor at the moment on pricing for these high-quality assets. There are bidders that are still stepping in into the to 3%, 7%, 5% to 4% cap rate range. So there appears to be a bid certainly for those type of assets. You get outside of that for assets that aren't as well located, have a significant value add. The price differential can be a little bit different, but that's not what we're talking about. So our execution capabilities. Our ability to put our platform value in place on these assets like we're doing with the Tampa asset I think will yield us selectively an opportunity or 2 that we can execute on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC.\nRich Anderson: And just suggestion maybe do the question Q&A alphabetically next time. So the first question is the 22% rent to income. What's the range of that, assuming that there's that assumes though, kind of a 1.5 person per unit type of income? So what's the range of that 22%?\nTim Argo : Yes, Rich, this is Tim. It's a pretty narrow band. I'm going through all of our markets right now. The highest is 24%, the lowest is 19%. So pretty narrowband, most of them in that 22% range.\nRich Anderson: Okay. And then that to lead into my second question. You -- I think it was Tom that mentioned you're having move-outs for rent increases, but you're replacing that with 18% new lease increases and that same 22% rent to income. But is the cadence of that event like a single occupant moving out and roommates moving in. Is that sort of a dynamic that's going on? I'm not suggesting that there's an advance going on in doubling up, but maybe at the margin that, that's what's happening because people who are by themselves are starting to feel stretched?\nTom Grimes: Rich, we're not seeing the doubling up. And that if we look at our head count per unit, it's dropped each quarter since Q1 of '20 really pre-COVID. So we are not seeing signs of doubling up occurring.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney.\nRob Stevenson: Brad, with the land parcels that you've bought, how many projects do you now control land for future development on? And what's the ballpark expected cost to develop out those parcels?\nBrad Hill: So in terms of the sites, as I mentioned in my comments, we have 8 that we currently own 2,600, 2,700 units. That does not include sites that we have under contract where we have not purchased, for example, the Raleigh site that we look to close later this year that would be an additional site. Our JV sites that we have under contract with partners would be additional sites as well. So -- but in terms of what we own and control right now, there are 8 sites, 2,600, 2,700 units. The costs on those vary a bit. What I have in front of me is about, call it,  a unit on those assets.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. That's helpful. And then what caused you guys to push the Denver development start out?\nBrad Hill: Yes. That is really a permitting issue, and that's really what changed some of the funding requirements or needs from development that Al mentioned. Even the Tampa and the Raleigh project that we're working on, really the approval process is taking a lot longer than what we anticipated on all of those projects. So they're generally all getting delayed. What we're finding is these municipalities are really kind of kicking the cane down the road and reviewing things at this point, and it's taking a lot longer than we expected, but that is a permitting delay on the Denver deal.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al and Tom, when you look at the continued spend on the technology initiatives and some of the stuff from an operating standpoint, what's really left for you at this point that's going to make any type of material impact on margins or operating expenses going forward that you already haven't started? And how much more is there to come? Or are we at a point where you've done what you can for now and everything from here is incremental. When you look over the next couple of years in terms of operating margin spend, where is -- what's the drivers and what's the potential impact there for you guys?\nTom Grimes: We've made a lot of progress on our revenue and a ton more to come, and Tim's got a great outline that he'll walk you through on that.\nTim Argo : Yes, I'll walk through and hit a couple of key points, I think, that are important. So I would say, we're in the very early innings in terms of capturing efficiencies on the expense side, really going back to late 2019, early 2020, our initial focus really was on the opportunities with  and some of the revenue opportunities, as you mentioned, and what that could do for us on the revenue side. And then really as well, the key infrastructure that, that puts into place as a result, it integrates with site plan that can help make our service staff and maintenance operations a little more efficient. And then also offer some opportunities from more seamless self-touring options. So I think important to note today, these have been rolled out about 3/4 of our units. And for the full year 2022, there's about $16 million or so of NOI embedded in our NOI stream for 2022. And then by the end of 2023, as we roll out some more, we think there's probably 120 basis points of margin enhancement from the rent increases just strictly on the Smart Home. And then as we fully roll it out, I think it will get fully priced out, probably by about mid-2024, you're talking 140 basis points of margin expansion just related to this piece and $25 million to $30 million of sort of ongoing NOI stream related to that. So now the focus, as we've got that into place is a little more on the expense side. And so I think now with our new CRM tool in process and live across the portfolio, we're focused on some of the efficiencies we think we can get primarily through staffing and task efficiencies. Right now, the new CRM gives us a lot greater access and visibility into properties and prospects, and we're focused on initially on some of the on-site office oversight roles to efficiencies from properties within close proximity, so call it pods or however you want to label it. We think that some of the near-term benefits that come over the next year or so. So when we think about adding, there's about 200 of our properties, call it, 70% of our portfolio that fit into 2 or more property pilot-type scenario. We think that will create somewhere $5 million to $10 million, about 40 basis points of margin expansion as we get towards the end of 2023 just on that piece. And so then we started thinking about beyond the initial pilot scenarios we're working on. We're testing and we're working on and reworking processes related to self-touring, virtual touring, AI technology as well as centralizing and automating some on-site activity. So we think that ultimately creates more efficiencies on the leasing side and other day-to-day tasks. And with our portfolio size, just given the high degree of variability in our assets, mid-rise, high-rise, garden style, some variation, frankly, in the consumer preferences across our markets. In many cases, there isn't just a one-size-fit-all solution. So trying to be thoughtful of that and mindful of that. So a long way of answering your question that beyond the 180 basis points of margin expansion that I mentioned between the Smart Rent and some of the initial podding. We think there's a lot more opportunity to come over the next couple of years.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then last 1 for me. Tom, when are you hitting your most difficult month of year-over-year comps in terms of the blended lease growth?\nTom Grimes: We're heading into it now. We are headed into it now. And Al had the back half, front half split force that I think is pretty telling. I'll let him share that on blended piece. He's just got it handy.\nAl Campbell: Yes, I mean we certainly -- in going back to last year, the third and fourth quarters Rob has talked about where the -- when you're leasing the tip of the spear was 15% in the third quarter and 16% blended pricing in the fourth quarter. So those comps are what we're running into and probably July to August is kind of that peak of that heal comparing to. So I hope that answers the question.\nEric Bolton: I think it really is the third quarter will be the peak. And last year, in the fourth quarter, we had a little fall off. We expect -- so it was not quite as high, if you will, in the fourth quarter last year versus third quarter. So I think the third quarter will be are most challenging. But as noted earlier, I mean the July rents, which is obviously the first month of the quarter are pretty good. But as Al outlined in his comments, we expect blended pricing for the back half of the year in total to be 8% that's on top of 15% that we got last year over the back half of the year. And so -- but to answer your question specifically, Rob, I think it's really this month, next month, it'll probably be our toughest monthly comps.\nRob Stevenson: And then has anything changed since pre-COVID in terms of the amount of leases rolling in the fourth quarter? Are you still at a fairly consistent level -- so it's still a fairly light role in the fourth? Or have you allowed more leases to roll then since it's been better of late?\nTom Grimes: We've been quite disciplined on that, Rob, and that can get you into trouble in the fourth quarter, and our lease expirations remain on target with a drawdown in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays.\nAnthony Powell : Question on some of your more tech and biotech focused markets like Austin and Raleigh. Have you seen any decline in traffic in those markets? Or do you expect to see any weakness there given some of the job now since we've seen in those sectors?\nTom Grimes: Yes. We have not on those 2 sides, particularly. And a large part of it is because of the ongoing tech transition that's occurring. So -- and just picking Austin, you've got Tesla opening its Gigafactory that's on. And so hiring is up in that area. And then Raleigh, Apple's building a large campus there and bringing on jobs. And those are just the headlines. But I think the Sunbelt still continues to benefit from the tech companies reallocating jobs across the country. So we're in pretty good shape in those 2 markets right now. And rent increases are fabulous there.\nAnthony Powell : And you talked a lot about how rent to income levels are consistent even as you raise rents so much, the incomes are going up. Over the long run, does that raise the risk of more move-outs to home ownership as you have maybe a more affluent renter base that may speak that out over the long run?\nTom Grimes: No. You would -- the thing to keep in mind is that what's going on with the homeownership rates over time, and that has grown at a faster rate than our rents have. And at this point, with the higher incomes coming in, I'm not sure we've seen move-outs to home buying at a lower point than the percentage that they are right now.\nEric Bolton: And I'll also add that what's been interesting to watch play out as well over the last 2 or 3 years is how the demographic of our renter profile has continued to evolve, continues to become increasingly single, continues to become increasingly female. And frankly, it's a demographic that wants the lifestyle that we're offering our communities as opposed to a single-family lifestyle. So we do not see any early concerns developing that should we find ourselves in a very affordable single-family housing market that we're at any sort of material risk from what we normally are in terms of move-outs associated with home buying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Just wanted to go back to the question on the Sunbelt. I appreciate the 9% versus 15% move-ins from outside to Sunbelt now. But if you think about -- I guess the question is, when you think about your total Sunbelt, are you saying that in your -- in the Sunbelt markets that you guys operate, the inbound migration is not as big of an impact overall? Or you're seeing in your portfolio, you guys tend to pull a lot more Sunbelt based residents while the overall markets that you operate in tend to benefit a lot from inbound migration? I'm trying to differentiate whether MAA's experience with inbound migration is representative of the market or more how you guys are positioned within your markets?\nEric Bolton: Alex, that's a good question. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. I mean, obviously, the 9% to 15% metrics that you were talking about and sort of the move in traffic that we're seeing from outside the Sunbelt into our markets, it's only based on what we are actually seeing at our properties. And so it may be that when you look at other sort of broader market statistics that are published and reported on, it may in fact be, if you will, some higher level of migration trend that has been occurring than the 15% that we're alluding to that we saw in the second quarter. But I think that -- and obviously, a lot of the migration that's happening out of the coastal markets into the Sunbelt. I think there's been a lot reported on that. A lot of these people that are moving are fairly affluent households. And more likely than not, I would tell you that I think that a lot of the households that are relocating given that affluence are probably going into single-family homes. And to some degree, as we see single-family home pricing in markets like Atlanta and Nashville going through the roof, it is people coming from outside the Sunbelt homeowners outside the Sunbelt coming into the Sunbelt and wanting to be homeowners in the Sunbelt. So there probably is some level of differentiation there. But the point that I was trying to make earlier, which I certainly think you touched on is that the notion that we are, at least, within our portfolio that we've been somehow way outside -- captured a significant outsized benefit to relocations from the outside of Sunbelt. I think that, that's been a bit overstated. For us, it's only -- it's still only 15% of our move-ins. And as compared to 9%, as I said earlier. And so we're still seeing a significant amount of the leases that we're executing on and the vast majority are from people just moving around within the Sunbelt, if you will.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question. On the market disruption that you guys discussed early on the call, and many of my peers have asked about on the cap rates, you said up 40 bps buyers or sellers want more, the better sponsors. Just to be clear, this is really fall out from levered buyers stepping away and such that when you look year-over-year, cap rates really aren't changed. So as that process come up off the market? Or are you suggesting that it's beyond that, like more deals are unwinding simply regardless of whether it's a levered buyer or not simply because of the macro interest rate, pick your favorite  of the day. I'm just trying to understand whether you're specifically talking to levered buyers pulling back in the fallout or if this is a broader fallout in the market on transactions?\nBrad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. One thing I would say is that there's not a ton of transaction data at this point. So I think, frankly, there's not a lot on the market right now. And I think as we get into the third quarter, we'll certainly start to see more data points. But what we're seeing today, it appears that the majority of the fallout to use your term is related to the higher levered buyers pulling back and buyers with shorter-term time horizons pulling out of the market. And those are impacting a certain type of asset class. They're not as impactful the stuff that we are looking at. We certainly hear in the market that cap rates are off 75 to 100 basis points. So we're not seeing that at this point out. Clearly, certain assets that are not well located or have some type of inherent issue with them. You could certainly see that. But we're not seeing that at this point. And based on the fact that every deal that we saw that closed in the second quarter was with institutional quality capital tells us that there's still a demand by institutional capital for well-located assets and the cap rates have moved a bit, but they have not moved tremendously. And they're still down from where we were second quarter of last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: So with day-to-day inflation on commodities, food complex, gas prices. Could you talk about what you are seeing, if any impact on your residence? Has the discussion in negotiation level of negotiation gone up on renewables, just given more pressure on day-to-day expenses for some of your tenants perhaps?\nTom Grimes: Chandni, it's Tom. And the level of negotiation, if you will, in terms of the feedback that we get from residents began to go up last year as renewal increases went up last year. We negotiated well less than a percentage point on our renewal offers. In fact, it's like 20 basis points. That has not changed over time. And the renewal accept rate has continued as it has pretty historically high and turnover staying flat. So we're getting -- we get questions about it, but we have not needed to adjust our renewal rates. And so very little push -- I mean, excuse me, pushback in that area. But when they get out in the market and they look at what our new lease rate is, which is still $100 higher than our average renewal rate. They kind of see that they're priced fairly and accept the rate and move on.\nTim Argo : And Chandni, it is Tim. I think a point worth noting, if you look at some of our B assets or little bit lower price point assets. We actually have seen pricing performance do a little bit better in the last couple of quarters on those assets. So arguably, those would be the ones that might feel a little more pressure and we just haven't seen it from a pricing standpoint?\nChandni Luthra: Got it. And if I could get a quick follow-up, please. In terms of the development pipeline, how has the inflationary environment, supply chain, permitting delays that you talked about impacted yields, if you could give us some mathematical color around that, please?\nBrad Hill: Yes. I would say that just municipal delays and those type things is not having much of an impact at this point on our overall yields. Certainly, in the last 6 months, we have seen a tremendous increase in cost escalation very acute the last 6 months, I'd say. But we are starting to see early signs of that cost escalation alleviate a bit. Certainly, some of the commodity prices are down, lumber is down just given that the single-family construction is off a bit. So from where we sit today, it looks like going forward that the cost escalation that we are seeing will start to mitigate itself. I don't think cost go backwards, but I think the rate of increase will substantially slower. It looks like it will substantially slow. And then you couple that with we're seeing on the rent side and our yields are actually holding up pretty well from those delays that I just talked about.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.\nTayo Okusanya: Most of my questions have been answered. But just a quick one. I mean you did mention earlier on that the resident base is increasingly turning single, increasingly turning female. I'm just curious how that is impacting how buildings are designed going forward, whether it's unit mix and kind of what implications that could have for development costs going forward? And also, if you could kind of throw in any ESG considerations as part of that answer.\nBrad Hill: From a development aspect, frankly, we haven't changed a whole lot relative to that. I mean, other than our amenities to take into account pets has increased substantially. So I'd say that would be one thing that certainly has changed. And then just broadly, I think the desire for meeting spaces in common area spaces where folks -- whether -- no matter what demographic it is, where folks can gather and just be in community with the other folks of the complex has certainly grown, and we're spending a lot of time on that. But other than, I would say, the pet areas that we've had to spend more design attention and paid more design attention to, there hasn't really been a whole lot of change associated with the demographic change there.\nEric Bolton: Tayo, and what I would say, over a longer period of time, longer horizon, I think that what has changed about the product in general, and it was a change in response to this demographic shift, but I think the demographic shift that you alluded to is finding it attractive and that is structured parking, interior hallways, I think it's also been 1 of the reasons why our Smart Home and  technology has been so embraced. It just -- it provides a certain degree of privacy that I think people really appreciate. And get out of the weather elements a little bit more with the interior hallways and the structured parking deck. So I think those things have continued to really find great receptivity this demographic shift that we've mentioned, and I think it will continue to do so going forward.\nTim Argo : Tayo, this is Tim. To hit on your ESG point. Our ESG group works closely with our development group and we've kind of historically built at least a broad standard in terms of green building certification. We're evaluating that and along the ones we've done recently for silver, even golds and -- so we're definitely thinking about in our underwriting, kind of considering what makes sense, but from a resident perspective and from our perspective as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's  on for Nick. Most of my questions have been answered a lot of great detail. Just a quick 1 for me, and I apologize if you answered this, but what is the assumed split between new renewal embedded in the new guide? Is there an expectation for like a divergence through the end of the year in '23?\nAl Campbell: This is Al. Just some color on that. I mean, certainly, as we talked about, as Eric mentioned, 8% over the back half of the year, there is a little bit lower expectation for the fourth quarter because that's 1 of the seasonality that we talked about would kind of begin because of the holiday season. So -- but in general, what we've built on is renewals continue to be the strongest I would say, in double digits, probably lower double digits, likely in that range with new leasing, which tends to feel the most pressure of probably both comps as well as certainly seasonality being in single digit by mid-single-digit range, and that's sort of the estimate for the back half of the year that you can roll in.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then what are the main drivers of the components of the OpEx guidance increase? I know you mentioned real estate taxes are roughly 4% to 5%. So just wondering what's increasing the rest of that 6.5% to 7.5%?\nBrad Hill: In general, it's -- for the increase for the quarter 2 components, primarily really repair and maintenance as well as taxes. We talked about taxes. And so -- and so I'll talk about repair and maintenance really is more just cost of materials, HVAC costs because it's been a hot summer as well as this is a month of our highest turnover by design as we have more of our units, we pushed most of our turnover in the summer months because that's when the demand is there. So that pressure is being built there a bit, and we're not seeing that -- I don't expect that to dissipate significantly or the back half of the year at this point. Some of the things Tim mentioned will help us going forward. But really repair and maintenance and taxes were the reasons for that change.\nOperator: Our next question comes from  from Green Street.\nUnidentified Analyst: Brad, I was just wondering if you could share pricing expectations for the incremental dispositions that you're guiding to through year-end? And then on top of that, too, if you could touch on the just of those assets that you're marketing and considering marketing that would be great.\nBrad Hill: Yes. So I think I mentioned it in my initial comments. The 2 that we look to bring out or have on the market right now. One is in suburban Maryland, and then one is in Austin, and these are 20 -- on average, 25-year-old assets that we look to bring out. So in terms of pricing expectations on those, for the entire set -- for the year, we expect to achieve a, call it, a 4% to 4.5% yield on those assets. And the way we look at that is an NOI yield and 1 of the things that is having an impact on our yields there is specifically the asset in Suburban Maryland. That's an asset that has had some challenges in a number of ways. One, specific to the asset, it has a right of first refusal that the county there has where they can step in and buy the asset, they have the right to match any offer that you get. Normally, that's not a big deal, but they did recently take advantage of a  they had on another asset nearby. They have not done that in years. So obviously, the buyer pool is well aware of that. So they're more reluctant to spend a lot of time on an asset going through due diligence because what they have to do is go under contract on the asset and continue to their due diligence, but at any time during that period, the county can roll for the product. So we're seeing a little bit of an impact associated with that. We also have on that asset some regulatory issues, which recently rolled back, but it has impacted the performance renewal cap increases and things of that nature. So that is impacting the pricing of that asset, which is driving our overall returns a little bit off on those dispositions from what we would normally expect.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate the color there. And Tom, are you noticing any pickup in concessions in any of your more heavily supply markets that other operators might be using to drive up demand?\nTom Grimes: No. The concessions have really not been heavily used and where we see them is really only in the pockets where they're not really being used to drive excess demand on a stabilized asset, but you see them use from time-to-time on new lease-ups. But we're not having to compete much with those at this point just because our demand level is good, and concessions are less than 0.4% of our net potential right now.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Barry Lu from  Group.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was -- my first question was on the expense side. Could you -- I think you mentioned 180 bps of margin expansion from technology investments in your platform. Do you know how much of that expansion is coming from expense versus top line revenue growth?\nTim Argo : Yes. For the specific 180, about 40 or so of that is related to expense and the rest is revenue. And then that's just what all we've identified for now, or we think there's some further opportunity on the expense side in the next couple of years.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And also, are you concerned about turnover at all? And how much more are you willing to push pricing the capital more of your loss to lease? And also, do you know what the loss we see?\nTom Grimes: Turnover at 45% on a 12-month rolling basis is very good and low, sort of the lowest I've seen in my career, and we feel very good about the opportunity for pricing going forward and still believe now is the time to push rate versus volume. So we'll see a seasonal slowdown and tougher comps, but demand is good and our priority is for growing rents.\nUnidentified Analyst: And sorry, you mention what your loss lease was?\nTim Argo : Yes. On the loss lease, if you look at our June blended rents compared to where our whole portfolio sits, it's about 8% or so. If you look at just new leases, it's about 11%, but we would typically expect that to be the highest right now. This is sort of the peak season, but that's where it stands right now.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Well, we appreciate everyone being on the call and hanging there with us. And obviously, feel free to reach out back to us at any point if you have any other questions you'd like to ask. So thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's program.

            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Leasing conditions remained strong across our Sunbelt portfolio, job growth, positive migration trends and the higher cost of single-family home ownership continue to fuel strong demand roughly halfway through the busy leasing season, we do not see any indication that demand is slowing. Leasing traffic or leads were up 11% in the second quarter as compared to prior year generating a 7% jump in lease applications, new move-ins during the quarter from households migrating into our Sunbelt footprint increased slightly from last year and drove 15% of our new move-ins. Further supporting the strength of the leasing market and the prospects for continued rent growth, it's worth noting that the rent-to-income ratio of the new leases executed in the second quarter was 22%, it remains in a very affordable range. Collections also remained strong with 99.5% of the rent build in the second quarter collected, which is actually up slightly from 99.4% collected in the preceding first quarter. Al will touch on this and while we see no near-term indications that leasing conditions are poised to change and we expect the strong occupancy and rent growth trends to continue, we do anticipate that we'll see some year-over-year moderation in rent growth over the back half of the year as the prior year performance comparisons become more difficult. But current rent levels continue to hold up well and are increasingly fueling solid revenue momentum for the start of the next calendar year. Pressure on operating expenses from the competitive labor market, inflationary and supply chain pressures and real estate taxes continued in the second quarter. We expect these pressures will likely persist over the balance of the year with some relief beginning in 2023 as we begin to harvest increasing benefits from our new tech and margin expansion initiatives. On balance, given the strong top line performance, our NOI margin continues to expand. And as noted in our earnings release, we, once again, increased our expectations for growth in same-store net operating income for the year. We are seeing increasing opportunity within the transaction market and are very pleased with our Tampa property acquisition completed earlier this month. This new property acquisition is actually located directly adjacent to 1 of our existing properties providing an opportunity to consolidate on-site operations to drive a very attractive investment return. Our new development pipeline continues to expand as we continue to find attractive opportunities to drive value and yields well above our overall cost of capital. Our pipeline of existing construction projects remains on budget, and our lease-up projects are outperforming our pro formas. We remain very encouraged by the current leasing conditions and the early momentum in key variables that will define calendar year 2023's initial performance. There are, of course, growing concerns surrounding the broader economy and concerns surrounding a potential recession. Should we find ourselves facing a weaker economic backdrop later this year or in 2023, we believe that MAA is very well positioned for such an environment. First, we believe that the well diversified and more affordable nature of our markets will continue to enable our Sunbelt portfolio to better weather an economic slowdown as compared to other regions. MAA's balance sheet and coverage ratios are very strong and better than at any point in our company's history. We continue to introduce new technology and changes to our operating practices that will drive more efficiency and higher margins over the next couple of years. MAA has had a established performance record of responding well to down cycles, and I'm confident that we will again demonstrate that resilience, should we find ourselves in such an environment. Meanwhile, our outlook remains positive, and current leasing conditions are very strong. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad. Well, John, this is Eric. I think that broadly speaking, across our markets and our footprint, I mean, we see that our product is pretty for but that rent-to-income ratio that we see between the As and Bs is pretty consistent across the portfolio. Our collections performance is still consistent across the portfolio. So I think that trying to think that the Bs will maybe do a little bit better than As in a downturn just because it's a slightly more affordable product. But honestly, I don't think there's going to be a huge difference if we find ourselves in a downturn of some sort, I think it becomes more a question about markets that you're in. And employment base, employment diversification. And certainly, I do think that a slightly more affordable product probably holds up a little bit better. But across our Sunbelt markets, we think that broadly, the whole region will just do a little bit better in a downturn as it has historically always in prior downturns. Well, Austin, our long-term approach to this business and strategy has long been based on a notion of trying to position for the full cycle, both the down part of the cycle and the up part of the cycle. And we have long believed that the way to do that is to focus on markets where we think that job growth, population growth is likely to be the best over time, over the full cycle, which has caused us to continue to retain our focus on these Sunbelt markets. In an effort to take further cyclicality out of our performance. The other thing that we've intentionally done over the years is that we have purposely been very diversified across the region as well as differentiated capital allocation between large markets as well as some of the select secondary markets of the region as well. And as was touched on earlier, we tend to have a price point in our portfolio that appeals to the broadest segment of the rental market. We don't do the sort of the low end or the super high end. We averaged kind of right in the middle. So we're appealing, if you will, to the largest segment of the rental market. So all that to say that our strategy, we think, has continued to serve us very well for a long time. The migration trends that we've talked about over the last couple of years, of course, they were evident there prior to COVID and move-ins from outside the Sunbelt into our footprint prior to COVID, we're running somewhere around 9%. And now it's up to -- of our move-ins, 9% of our move-ins were coming from people moving into the Sunbelt. Now it's up to 15% of our move-ins are coming from people to Sunbelt. So a long way of saying, while certainly there's been a trend of migration that has worked in our favor. It's not like it's been huge. It's not 50% of our move-ins or something of that nature. It's gone from 9% to 15%. So I think that particular variable of move-ins migration trends, if you will, helpful hasn't been as significant as sometimes what I think depressed and others to make it out as when you read what's going on nationally. Beyond that, I will just tell you that I think in a recessionary environment, if we find ourselves in such a scenario, I think that the diversification of the employment base, the employers, the affordability of the region that we have in the Sunbelt, I think all continues to work in our favor. And we think that today, we very much retain our defensive characteristics that would be helpful to have should we find ourselves in a downturn. I think it really is the third quarter will be the peak. And last year, in the fourth quarter, we had a little fall off. We expect -- so it was not quite as high, if you will, in the fourth quarter last year versus third quarter. So I think the third quarter will be are most challenging. But as noted earlier, I mean the July rents, which is obviously the first month of the quarter are pretty good. But as Al outlined in his comments, we expect blended pricing for the back half of the year in total to be 8% that's on top of 15% that we got last year over the back half of the year. And so -- but to answer your question specifically, Rob, I think it's really this month, next month, it'll probably be our toughest monthly comps. And I'll also add that what's been interesting to watch play out as well over the last 2 or 3 years is how the demographic of our renter profile has continued to evolve, continues to become increasingly single, continues to become increasingly female. And frankly, it's a demographic that wants the lifestyle that we're offering our communities as opposed to a single-family lifestyle. So we do not see any early concerns developing that should we find ourselves in a very affordable single-family housing market that we're at any sort of material risk from what we normally are in terms of move-outs associated with home buying.

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Transaction activity in the second quarter slowed meaningfully from the first quarter of the year as the increase in interest rates coupled with a higher degree of economic uncertainty have combined Ascend Buyers with shorter investment time horizons as well as buyers using higher leverage to the sidelines. Unlike previous quarters, we saw a number of properties fall out of contract in the second quarter. For the properties that did close, generally, they closed with stronger institutional quality investors at cap rates that were 40 basis points higher than where deals traded in the first quarter. As the uncertainty in the market has risen, our ability to move quickly and close all cash has led to a significant increase in inbound calls to our transaction team. As Eric mentioned, in July, we successfully acquired a newly constructed property in the Tampa MSA. This 196-unit property is adjacent to an existing MAA property and will be fully integrated into our existing property, creating operational efficiencies and margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years. Our under construction and in lease-up pipeline remains at $740 million. While we had no construction starts in the second quarter, we did purchase a land parcel for a planned 2023 start of a 300-unit development in Orlando. Also, subsequent to quarter end, we purchased a 500-unit development site in the Denver MSA that we also expect to start construction on in 2023. These land purchases bring our owned land sites for development to 8 sites with entitlements for approximately 2,677 units. We previously expected to start construction on our sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver this year, but we've pushed the start of our Denver project to 2023. Predevelopment work on our Raleigh and Tampa projects are progressing and subject to receiving acceptable construction costs and the appropriate building permits, we still expect to start construction on these projects this year. We continue predevelopment work on several additional in-house and prepurchase developments located in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando and Salt Lake City that we hope to start over the next 18 months. The timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes but at this time, we expect to start construction on approximately 1,250 units this year, and we expect to end the year with a pipeline of under construction projects over $700 million and pipeline of projects both under construction and in lease-up between $925 million and $975 million. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressures surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall job cost. To avoid the cost escalation that is so prevalent in the market today, we are making commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process than we've had to in the past. Nevertheless, delivery delays, material shortages and securing building permits remain our biggest challenges. In our supplemental, we did push back by 1 quarter, our expected delivery dates on Novel Val Vista in Phoenix and Central Park in Denver. Operating performance at communities in their initial lease-up continues to strengthen, traffic and leads remain elevated, leading to rents well ahead of our pro forma expectations at all of our lease-up communities. Due to the strong leasing performance achieved by our property team at MAA Westland, we moved up our expected stabilization date by 1 quarter to third quarter of '22. As mentioned in our release, we successfully sold our 2 disposition properties in the Fort Worth market for $167 million. We have 2 more planned disposition properties in the market that we hope to close late this year. One is in Suburban Maryland, and one is in the Austin market. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Brad, this is Brad Hill. I think certainly, we've talked about over the last few quarters, the vision and the plan to grow our development pipeline, and we're certainly on pace to do that as I laid out in my comments and what Al has done with the balance sheet and the really optionality that he has provided us with to be able to do that is there. And I would say just on the acquisition side, certainly, we're keeping our eyes open in that area. And like past disruptions in the market, we've been able to really take advantage of those within our footprint, we have focused on the Sunbelt region of the country for the last 28 years. So we know that region of the country. We certainly have executed both on a transaction side and then operating side for the last 28 years there do all parts of the cycle. So what Al is doing with the balance sheet puts us in a great position to be able to execute on some opportunities, which are likely to manifest themselves during this time. Yes. Austin, this is Brad. In terms of cap rates, as I mentioned in my comments, there's definitely been a movement in the last 2 to 3 months. But that movement is very different based on the asset quality, the asset location. And just to keep in mind, really the assets that we're looking at is just a segment of the assets that are out there. I mean we're looking at well-located assets, brand-new assets, high-quality assets. And so what we've seen there is about a 40 basis points change in the cap rates. And what we've also seen, though, is we look at the assets that traded in the second quarter, every asset that traded went to a high-quality institutional capital. So we're seeing buyers certainly flock to high-quality assets, and we're also seeing sellers flock to high-quality buyers. And that's where, in the past, when the markets have changed, where we've been able to find our opportunities through our execution capabilities and through just our 28-year history in the markets that we're in. So as we sit here today, we are getting more calls on acquisitions than we've ever received, frankly, to look at assets that either are fell out of contract or they're just taking to a couple of folks that they know can close the assets. So we're getting a lot of look at assets. And then I think just from an underwriting perspective, the deals within our region of the country just continue to perform extremely well, which leads us to believe that from a performance standpoint, these assets, again, that are very high quality will continue to perform. And I do think that the assets that are coming to market that we're looking at are likely to trade. You mentioned cap rates today versus a year ago. Well, cap rates today on what we're looking at are a 3.7. A year ago, they were 3.8. So we're still under kind of where we were a year ago. So although there's been some recent movement, interest rates went up in the second quarter, they're back down a bit. You can get a 10-year rate right now in the 3%, 4%, 5% range. So there appears to be on the assets that we are bidding against a floor at the moment on pricing for these high-quality assets. There are bidders that are still stepping in into the to 3%, 7%, 5% to 4% cap rate range. So there appears to be a bid certainly for those type of assets. You get outside of that for assets that aren't as well located, have a significant value add. The price differential can be a little bit different, but that's not what we're talking about. So our execution capabilities. Our ability to put our platform value in place on these assets like we're doing with the Tampa asset I think will yield us selectively an opportunity or 2 that we can execute on. So in terms of the sites, as I mentioned in my comments, we have 8 that we currently own 2,600, 2,700 units. That does not include sites that we have under contract where we have not purchased, for example, the Raleigh site that we look to close later this year that would be an additional site. Our JV sites that we have under contract with partners would be additional sites as well. So -- but in terms of what we own and control right now, there are 8 sites, 2,600, 2,700 units. The costs on those vary a bit. What I have in front of me is about, call it,  a unit on those assets. Yes. That is really a permitting issue, and that's really what changed some of the funding requirements or needs from development that Al mentioned. Even the Tampa and the Raleigh project that we're working on, really the approval process is taking a lot longer than what we anticipated on all of those projects. So they're generally all getting delayed. What we're finding is these municipalities are really kind of kicking the cane down the road and reviewing things at this point, and it's taking a lot longer than we expected, but that is a permitting delay on the Denver deal. Yes, this is Brad. One thing I would say is that there's not a ton of transaction data at this point. So I think, frankly, there's not a lot on the market right now. And I think as we get into the third quarter, we'll certainly start to see more data points. But what we're seeing today, it appears that the majority of the fallout to use your term is related to the higher levered buyers pulling back and buyers with shorter-term time horizons pulling out of the market. And those are impacting a certain type of asset class. They're not as impactful the stuff that we are looking at. We certainly hear in the market that cap rates are off 75 to 100 basis points. So we're not seeing that at this point out. Clearly, certain assets that are not well located or have some type of inherent issue with them. You could certainly see that. But we're not seeing that at this point. And based on the fact that every deal that we saw that closed in the second quarter was with institutional quality capital tells us that there's still a demand by institutional capital for well-located assets and the cap rates have moved a bit, but they have not moved tremendously. And they're still down from where we were second quarter of last year. Yes. I would say that just municipal delays and those type things is not having much of an impact at this point on our overall yields. Certainly, in the last 6 months, we have seen a tremendous increase in cost escalation very acute the last 6 months, I'd say. But we are starting to see early signs of that cost escalation alleviate a bit. Certainly, some of the commodity prices are down, lumber is down just given that the single-family construction is off a bit. So from where we sit today, it looks like going forward that the cost escalation that we are seeing will start to mitigate itself. I don't think cost go backwards, but I think the rate of increase will substantially slower. It looks like it will substantially slow. And then you couple that with we're seeing on the rent side and our yields are actually holding up pretty well from those delays that I just talked about. From a development aspect, frankly, we haven't changed a whole lot relative to that. I mean, other than our amenities to take into account pets has increased substantially. So I'd say that would be one thing that certainly has changed. And then just broadly, I think the desire for meeting spaces in common area spaces where folks -- whether -- no matter what demographic it is, where folks can gather and just be in community with the other folks of the complex has certainly grown, and we're spending a lot of time on that. But other than, I would say, the pet areas that we've had to spend more design attention and paid more design attention to, there hasn't really been a whole lot of change associated with the demographic change there. In general, it's -- for the increase for the quarter 2 components, primarily really repair and maintenance as well as taxes. We talked about taxes. And so -- and so I'll talk about repair and maintenance really is more just cost of materials, HVAC costs because it's been a hot summer as well as this is a month of our highest turnover by design as we have more of our units, we pushed most of our turnover in the summer months because that's when the demand is there. So that pressure is being built there a bit, and we're not seeing that -- I don't expect that to dissipate significantly or the back half of the year at this point. Some of the things Tim mentioned will help us going forward. But really repair and maintenance and taxes were the reasons for that change. Yes. So I think I mentioned it in my initial comments. The 2 that we look to bring out or have on the market right now. One is in suburban Maryland, and then one is in Austin, and these are 20 -- on average, 25-year-old assets that we look to bring out. So in terms of pricing expectations on those, for the entire set -- for the year, we expect to achieve a, call it, a 4% to 4.5% yield on those assets. And the way we look at that is an NOI yield and 1 of the things that is having an impact on our yields there is specifically the asset in Suburban Maryland. That's an asset that has had some challenges in a number of ways. One, specific to the asset, it has a right of first refusal that the county there has where they can step in and buy the asset, they have the right to match any offer that you get. Normally, that's not a big deal, but they did recently take advantage of a  they had on another asset nearby. They have not done that in years. So obviously, the buyer pool is well aware of that. So they're more reluctant to spend a lot of time on an asset going through due diligence because what they have to do is go under contract on the asset and continue to their due diligence, but at any time during that period, the county can roll for the product. So we're seeing a little bit of an impact associated with that. We also have on that asset some regulatory issues, which recently rolled back, but it has impacted the performance renewal cap increases and things of that nature. So that is impacting the pricing of that asset, which is driving our overall returns a little bit off on those dispositions from what we would normally expect."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.02 was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. The outperformance virtually all came from property revenues and stronger than projected rental pricing trends continued through the quarter, which produced a strong 17.2% increase in blended lease pricing for the quarter even as more challenging prior year comparisons began to grow late in the quarter. We do continue to expect a growing impact from prior comps as we move through the back half of the year as well as a return of a more normal seasonal pattern during the fourth quarter, which we'll discuss just a bit more  guidance in a moment. Same-store operating expenses for the quarter were slightly higher than projected as we saw some inflationary pressures and repair maintenance costs as well as revised expectations for real estate tax expenses for the year as more valuation information came in during the quarter. Our revised guidance for the year reflects these expense pressures, but these are more than offset by growing revenues as reflected by our revised NOI guidance. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever as reflected by the upgrade to an A- credit rating by Fitch during the quarter. We continue to have discussions with the other agencies and are confident the strength will eventually be reflected in our other ratings as well. Just after the end of the quarter, we completed a renewal of our unsecured credit facility, which is our primary tool for liquidity and short-term funding of development, debt maturities and short-term operating needs. As part of the renewal, we increased the facility size to $1.25 billion from $1 billion and capture improvements in pricing and terms despite the growing volatility of the financing markets. At the end of the quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and our leverage was historically low with debt to EBITDA at a low 3.97x and 100% of our debt had fixed interest rates with an average maturity of 8.2 years, providing potential in a rising interest rate environment. And finally, given the second quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.17 per share or 2% at the midpoint to a range of $8.13 to $8.37 per share or $8.25 at the midpoint. This now represents a 17.5% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all the result of higher revenue growth, strong price intends continued through the second quarter, as we mentioned, we're now projecting a 125 basis points increase in our effective rent growth expectation for the year to 13.25% at the midpoint. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some growing impact from prior year comps for the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter, as we mentioned. We expect blended lease pricing to be approximately 8% for the second half of the year, which for context is on top of a record high 15% growth in blended pricing captured in the back half of last year. So I think this reflects our expectation for continued strong demand in our markets. As mentioned, we also increased the expected growth rate for same-store operating expenses for the full year by 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, now 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, primarily reflecting the pressure in repair and maintenance costs as well as real estate taxes. Property valuations received during the quarter, mainly in Texas, reflected aggressive assessments, and we do expect these valuation increases to be partially offset by millage rate rollbacks finalized late in the year, but we increased our expectation for taxes by 100 basis points for the full year to reflect the net impact. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our expectations for same-store NOI growth for the year to a midpoint of 15%, up from the 13.5% provided at the end of the first quarter. And this represents a 170 basis point expansion in our margin in 2022 from the prior year. So other changes to guidance of note were a $50 million reduction in our expected development spending for the year, reflecting really revised timing of funding as well as a $25 million reduction in our gross disposition proceeds as we finalized the sale of the 2 remaining properties in Maryland in Austin. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Gretchen we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions. I think he said also in real estate taxes -- I think a couple of things, and I'll start with this, Tom, and please jump in here. But on the guidance on that, and John, you were broken up, but I think you're asking that. And it's 2 things primarily, which  up a bit. And then real estate taxes, which is obviously almost 40% of our expenses, that's a real big driver of that. And for that picture, particularly, we started the year with no information really, put out our best estimates of it. And we saw the valuations come in higher. They're pretty aggressive as they're coming in particularly from Texas. As we mentioned, we do expect rate rollbacks or millage rate rollbacks come in for a large part of that as it progresses. But we get those late in the year, so it's hard to get a picture of that. And we'll certainly continue to fight like we do every year and we'll formally litigate over half of our Texas portfolio. So that's really the tax pressure. And Tom, you might want to give color on if you have any, but that's out, repair maintenance and taxes both in the quarter and I would say in the guidance as well as one for the back part of the year, probably tilting a little more toward taxes. Yes, I think that's a great question. I mean you hit that right, we have the Ford outstanding to, I think, February of next year. We don't have immediate plans to draw on that, but I think our expectations are between now and then to draw that to help fund the remaining development expectations for this year and as we go into next year. So we certainly don't need to take our leverage lower, but it is a part of our funding over the longer term that we think is important. I'll give the leverage target and maybe add Brad and Eric will talk on the other parts of the strategy, but we're a little below our range right now. I mean, we've talked about for the last couple of quarters, we always are working to add strength to the business in every area. So on our balance sheet, we're very strong right now. Our leverage is historically low debt to EBITDA may touched 3.97%. That's below. I think we would -- Andrew and I would say between 4% to 5% is probably preferred. 4.5%, you certainly wouldn't want to get above 5% in our current credit ratings. So we're below where we need to be. We believe that's opportunity, both as protection and opportunities. So as we move into this recession and some opportunities come up for Brad and the team, we want to give them that flexibility to do that. Yes, I mean we certainly -- in going back to last year, the third and fourth quarters Rob has talked about where the -- when you're leasing the tip of the spear was 15% in the third quarter and 16% blended pricing in the fourth quarter. So those comps are what we're running into and probably July to August is kind of that peak of that heal comparing to. So I hope that answers the question. This is Al. Just some color on that. I mean, certainly, as we talked about, as Eric mentioned, 8% over the back half of the year, there is a little bit lower expectation for the fourth quarter because that's 1 of the seasonality that we talked about would kind of begin because of the holiday season. So -- but in general, what we've built on is renewals continue to be the strongest I would say, in double digits, probably lower double digits, likely in that range with new leasing, which tends to feel the most pressure of probably both comps as well as certainly seasonality being in single digit by mid-single-digit range, and that's sort of the estimate for the back half of the year that you can roll in."

            "name": "Tom Grimes",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again robust, and our busy summer season is going well. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 17.2%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased by 14.3% on a year-over-year basis and 4% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver and with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.7. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. During the quarter, we completed 1,844 interior unit upgrades and installed 9,438 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first 8 properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another 8 projects that are underway this year. Strong leasing activity continues for July. Same-store lease-over-lease pricing on new move-ins as of July 25, is 17.9% ahead of the rent of the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July is running 15.4% of the prior lease and as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16.6% thus far in July. Same-store physical occupancy as of July 25 was 95.9. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations. Our teams have performed well during our busy summer season and have the portfolio well positioned for the slower fall and winter seasons. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Al. Yes. Nick, I'll jump in there. I mean I think looking at a few different fronts, but collections improved to 99.5 from 99.4, which is encouraging. Our unit types, we're not seeing a flight to efficiencies and our efficiency 1s, 2s and 3s are performing consistently. Our headcount units has moved from 1.7 heads to  on that. So it really seems to be moving steadily. I mean we are pushing rates, and we do see a tick-up in move-outs to rent increase. But again, we're moving those folks back in at 22%. So it's pretty steady as it goes, Nick. John, you're really fragmented. And I think the first question was what's the balance between A and B assets as we look on that? John, you were really broken there something about inflation and expense guidance. Rich, we're not seeing the doubling up. And that if we look at our head count per unit, it's dropped each quarter since Q1 of '20 really pre-COVID. So we are not seeing signs of doubling up occurring. We've made a lot of progress on our revenue and a ton more to come, and Tim's got a great outline that he'll walk you through on that. We're heading into it now. We are headed into it now. And Al had the back half, front half split force that I think is pretty telling. I'll let him share that on blended piece. He's just got it handy. We've been quite disciplined on that, Rob, and that can get you into trouble in the fourth quarter, and our lease expirations remain on target with a drawdown in the fourth quarter. Yes. We have not on those 2 sides, particularly. And a large part of it is because of the ongoing tech transition that's occurring. So -- and just picking Austin, you've got Tesla opening its Gigafactory that's on. And so hiring is up in that area. And then Raleigh, Apple's building a large campus there and bringing on jobs. And those are just the headlines. But I think the Sunbelt still continues to benefit from the tech companies reallocating jobs across the country. So we're in pretty good shape in those 2 markets right now. And rent increases are fabulous there. No. You would -- the thing to keep in mind is that what's going on with the homeownership rates over time, and that has grown at a faster rate than our rents have. And at this point, with the higher incomes coming in, I'm not sure we've seen move-outs to home buying at a lower point than the percentage that they are right now. Chandni, it's Tom. And the level of negotiation, if you will, in terms of the feedback that we get from residents began to go up last year as renewal increases went up last year. We negotiated well less than a percentage point on our renewal offers. In fact, it's like 20 basis points. That has not changed over time. And the renewal accept rate has continued as it has pretty historically high and turnover staying flat. So we're getting -- we get questions about it, but we have not needed to adjust our renewal rates. And so very little push -- I mean, excuse me, pushback in that area. But when they get out in the market and they look at what our new lease rate is, which is still $100 higher than our average renewal rate. They kind of see that they're priced fairly and accept the rate and move on. No. The concessions have really not been heavily used and where we see them is really only in the pockets where they're not really being used to drive excess demand on a stabilized asset, but you see them use from time-to-time on new lease-ups. But we're not having to compete much with those at this point just because our demand level is good, and concessions are less than 0.4% of our net potential right now. Turnover at 45% on a 12-month rolling basis is very good and low, sort of the lowest I've seen in my career, and we feel very good about the opportunity for pricing going forward and still believe now is the time to push rate versus volume. So we'll see a seasonal slowdown and tougher comps, but demand is good and our priority is for growing rents."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Yes, Nick, this is Tim. I'll hit that one. So thinking about the earn-in. The way we typically think about that is our full year blended lease-over-lease for this year, call it, somewhere around half of that, we would expect to blend into 2023. So If you think about the forecast that we laid out there in the 8% back half of the year, blended lease-over-lease that comes out to about somewhere 12%, 12.5% blended lease-over-lease is what we're expecting for full year 2022. So call it, somewhere about 6% earn-in as we sit here today. It's certainly the highest we've ever had. I think going back to 2020, it was 0 last year, I think it was about 3% or so, so certainly the highest we've seen. Yes. Between A and B, it's roughly 50-50. I mean there are some nuances between what we would call A plus A and B and B plus I would talk about 50-50 or so. Yes, Rich, this is Tim. It's a pretty narrow band. I'm going through all of our markets right now. The highest is 24%, the lowest is 19%. So pretty narrowband, most of them in that 22% range. Yes, I'll walk through and hit a couple of key points, I think, that are important. So I would say, we're in the very early innings in terms of capturing efficiencies on the expense side, really going back to late 2019, early 2020, our initial focus really was on the opportunities with  and some of the revenue opportunities, as you mentioned, and what that could do for us on the revenue side. And then really as well, the key infrastructure that, that puts into place as a result, it integrates with site plan that can help make our service staff and maintenance operations a little more efficient. And then also offer some opportunities from more seamless self-touring options. So I think important to note today, these have been rolled out about 3/4 of our units. And for the full year 2022, there's about $16 million or so of NOI embedded in our NOI stream for 2022. And then by the end of 2023, as we roll out some more, we think there's probably 120 basis points of margin enhancement from the rent increases just strictly on the Smart Home. And then as we fully roll it out, I think it will get fully priced out, probably by about mid-2024, you're talking 140 basis points of margin expansion just related to this piece and $25 million to $30 million of sort of ongoing NOI stream related to that. So now the focus, as we've got that into place is a little more on the expense side. And so I think now with our new CRM tool in process and live across the portfolio, we're focused on some of the efficiencies we think we can get primarily through staffing and task efficiencies. Right now, the new CRM gives us a lot greater access and visibility into properties and prospects, and we're focused on initially on some of the on-site office oversight roles to efficiencies from properties within close proximity, so call it pods or however you want to label it. We think that some of the near-term benefits that come over the next year or so. So when we think about adding, there's about 200 of our properties, call it, 70% of our portfolio that fit into 2 or more property pilot-type scenario. We think that will create somewhere $5 million to $10 million, about 40 basis points of margin expansion as we get towards the end of 2023 just on that piece. And so then we started thinking about beyond the initial pilot scenarios we're working on. We're testing and we're working on and reworking processes related to self-touring, virtual touring, AI technology as well as centralizing and automating some on-site activity. So we think that ultimately creates more efficiencies on the leasing side and other day-to-day tasks. And with our portfolio size, just given the high degree of variability in our assets, mid-rise, high-rise, garden style, some variation, frankly, in the consumer preferences across our markets. In many cases, there isn't just a one-size-fit-all solution. So trying to be thoughtful of that and mindful of that. So a long way of answering your question that beyond the 180 basis points of margin expansion that I mentioned between the Smart Rent and some of the initial podding. We think there's a lot more opportunity to come over the next couple of years. And Chandni, it is Tim. I think a point worth noting, if you look at some of our B assets or little bit lower price point assets. We actually have seen pricing performance do a little bit better in the last couple of quarters on those assets. So arguably, those would be the ones that might feel a little more pressure and we just haven't seen it from a pricing standpoint? Tayo, this is Tim. To hit on your ESG point. Our ESG group works closely with our development group and we've kind of historically built at least a broad standard in terms of green building certification. We're evaluating that and along the ones we've done recently for silver, even golds and -- so we're definitely thinking about in our underwriting, kind of considering what makes sense, but from a resident perspective and from our perspective as well. Yes. For the specific 180, about 40 or so of that is related to expense and the rest is revenue. And then that's just what all we've identified for now, or we think there's some further opportunity on the expense side in the next couple of years. Yes. On the loss lease, if you look at our June blended rents compared to where our whole portfolio sits, it's about 8% or so. If you look at just new leases, it's about 11%, but we would typically expect that to be the highest right now. This is sort of the peak season, but that's where it stands right now."

This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. MAA continues to capture robust leasing conditions across our portfolio, and we are carrying strong momentum in rent growth into the summer leasing season. Leasing traffic remains high, solid job growth, accelerating migration trends to our Sunbelt markets and the higher pricing hurdles for single-family ownership continue to fuel strong demand for apartment housing. Almost 14% of the new leases we wrote in the first quarter came from move-ins relocating to the Sunbelt. This is an increase of 190 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Resident turnover continues to remain low with move-outs further declining by close to 6% as compared to Q1 of last year. These trends continue to support our ability to capture strong rent growth. The rents in place at quarter end within the same-store portfolio were on average 12.4% higher on a comparable basis to the prior year. And encouragingly, the new leases that went into effect in the first quarter were 16.8% higher than the expiring leases. Pricing momentum remains strong heading into the important summer leasing period. Our largest pressures on property operating expenses were with personnel costs and repair and maintenance expenses as the tight labor market, inflationary pressures and supply chain issues make an impact. But with the strong top line performance, we continue to see strong NOI growth. And as detailed in our earnings release, we have increased our performance expectations for the full year. Our new development pipeline continues to perform very well with 5 of the projects now actively leasing and capturing rents that are higher than assumed in our projections. As detailed in the earnings release, we have 3 other developments under construction that we expect to start leasing late this year. In addition to the development detailed in the earnings release, we are also expecting to break ground on another 3 projects later this year located in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver. We're excited with the strong start to the year. Leasing conditions clearly remain very favorable. We have a number of initiatives underway with new technologies and redevelopment that will further fuel margin expansion and higher earnings growth from our existing portfolio and expanding new development pipeline will add -- will also fuel additional FFO growth over the next 2 to 3 years and the balance sheet is in a strong position to support our growth plans. MAA strategy has consistently demonstrated more resilient performance during weaker parts of the economic cycle. But as a consequence of the many enhancements we've made over the past few years to the portfolio mix, to the operating platform, to the balance sheet and to our external growth capabilities, we're excited to now also see MAA's ability to post strong relative performance during recovery and the up parts of the market cycle. In closing, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our team of MAA associates for their continued hard work and consistently strong performance. I thought I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress towards growing our new development pipeline. We finished the first quarter with $444 million under construction and $740 million combined under construction and in lease-up at an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%. The size of our total pipeline is up from $700 million at the end of 2021. During the first quarter, we started construction on a 352-unit project in Denver called MAA Park Central. This is the first phase of a 3-phase 1,000-unit project on land we purchased in late 2020. Predevelopment work at our 3 young sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver is progressing. And subject to receiving acceptable construction costs, we expect to start construction on these projects this year. Additionally, we continue predevelopment work on several in-house and prepurchase developments that we hope to start over the next 18 months in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. This pool of future development opportunities includes an entitled site in Denver that we purchased in the first quarter of this year. The timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes. But at this time, we expect to start construction on 1,600 to 1,800 units in 2022 and end the year with a pipeline of under-construction projects between $800 million and $900 million and a pipeline of total projects both under construction and in lease-up over $1 billion. Our operating performance at communities and their initial lease-up is strong, and we're achieving rents substantially above our pro forma expectations. Reflective of the strong leasing demand in our markets, we reached stabilization at our MAA Midtown Phoenix community 2 quarters earlier than our original expectation, while also achieving stabilized effective rents more than 7.5% above our original pro forma expectations. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job keeping labor and material cost increases from having an impact on our overall budgets. Material shortages and shipping delays are prevalent in the market today. And in many instances, necessitate us placing orders and making deposits much earlier in the process than we had to in the past to secure materials as well as our place in the delivery queue. Despite these challenges, we delivered our last units at both MAA  and MAA Park Point on time during the first quarter. Our 2022 disposition plan is underway with 2 properties in the Fort Worth market currently under contract with an expected closing date later in the second quarter. Buyer interest was strong for these 30-year-old properties with one buyer winning the opportunity to purchase both. We plan to sell 2 additional properties later in the year. Our transaction team also remains engaged in the transaction market, and we're actively evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and we continue to believe that as we get later in the year, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties are likely to materialize. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.\nTomGrimes: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust, and we're off to a good start in 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the first quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16.8% as a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis and 2.6% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.9%. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. At quarter end, we have completed 1,098 interior unit upgrades and installed 11,018 Smart Home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 Smart Home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 71,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first of 8 properties in the program that are now complete, results have exceeded our expectations of another 8 projects that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continues into April. Lease-over-lease pricing on new rent leases for April is currently at 16.5% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in April is running 16.7% ahead of the prior lease. And as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up 16.6% thus far in April. Average daily occupancy for the month of April is currently strong at 95.7%. And exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 8.5%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations and support our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth headed into the busy summer season. Our teams are well prepared and looking forward to the busier summer season. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all of our stakeholders. Al?\nAl Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $1.97 was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. And virtually all of the outperformance came from revenue growth as rental pricing, occupancy and collections all combined to produce 150 basis points of outperformance to our revenue expectation for the quarter. As Tom outlined, pricing trends continue to be strong through the first quarter and into April, as both new leases and renewals becoming effective during the quarter through solid double-digit growth over the prior lease. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong rent growth through this year and with some impact from prior year comps and returned to more normal seasonal patterns during the fourth quarter leasing season, which did not occur last year. Overall, same-store operating expenses were in line with expectations for the quarter, but we do expect continued inflationary pressure over the remainder of the year and particularly in personnel and maintenance costs, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection for market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We funded approximately $43 million of development costs during the quarter towards trajected $250 million funding for the full year. As Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to start several new deals this year and early next year, likely expanding our total construction pipeline to between $800 million to $1 billion by year-end, which remains well within our risk tolerance limits. We ended the quarter with low leverage. Our debt to EBITDA had a record low 4.27x, with virtually all of our debt fixed and well laddered over an average of 8.4 years and with $1 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity remaining under our line of credit. Also during the quarter, Moody's affirmed our debt rating of Baa1 and revised their outlook from stable to positive, bringing all 3 rating agencies now to a positive outlook. And this certainly reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the potential for upgraded ratings over the next several quarters. And finally, given the first quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.16 per share at the midpoint to $7.92 to $8.24 per share or $8.08 at the midpoint. This represents a 13% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all produced by higher revenue growth expectations as projected to continued strong pricing trends produce a 200 basis points increase in our effective rent growth, our expectation for the year to 12% at the midpoint compared to 10% in our prior guidance and 5.2% for the prior year performance. As mentioned, our revenue projection for the full year is built on continued solid pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some impact from prior year comps of the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. The trends with our property operating expenses remained largely in line with our original projections with some increased pressure expected from both from personnel and maintenance costs. The strong labor market, a robust development environment. And the continued supply chain issues are expected to continue to pressure our maintenance service salaries and materials costs. We increased our guidance for total operating expenses for this by 50 basis points at the midpoint to 6%, reflecting the continued pressure. However, it's worth to note, this increase is more than offset by the revenue growth trends, which produced a revised same-store NOI expectation of 13.5% for the full year, which is  above our prior guidance. The forecast for our largest property operating expense line on the real estate taxes remains at 4% to 5%. I'll add also as a result of the continued labor market inflation assumed higher performance-based incentives, given the strong projected performance, we have also raised the midpoint of our total overhead assumptions for the full year. And the only other change to our guidance was an increase in the dollar value of our disposition volume, which was increased $25 million to a midpoint of $350 million, reflecting higher pricing expectations on assets being sold. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: We will now open the call up for questions.  We will now take our first question from Neil Malkin from Capital One.\nNeil Malkin : First question, I just kind of want to touch on immigration trends. I mean, obviously, that's been something that's been talked about for particularly since COVID started. But I was wondering if you can give an update on how those trends are going on either property or market level. Are you seeing those -- that inflow kind of remain steady? Is it increasing from the last couple of quarters in terms of people coming in from out of state? And then the second part would be, are those people from out of state also bringing with them higher average incomes compared to, I guess, you want to call it in-state move-ins?\nTom Grimes: Neil, this is Tom. Just to give you the broad trend for first quarter start and '19, move-outs from outside the footprint were 9.1%; in '20, they were 10.1%; in '21, they were 12%; and this quarter, they were 14%. So accelerating across the board. And then we see places like Phoenix are now 22%, Tampa 18%; Nashville, 29%; 15% Charleston. And yes, we see -- so those trends are continuing and they're coming in at higher salaries as well.\nNeil Malkin : Yes. Makes sense. And then maybe I wanted to touch on the acquisition side. You guys have been kind of shying away from that, just given the low cap rates. And now with interest rates going up, I'm just curious about your comment about acquisitions, potentially pursuing some of those in the back half of the year. What are some of the trends that give you confidence that you might have some success there? Is it just elevated deliveries? Is it higher interest rates, maybe reducing competition? Any kind of color on the opportunities you see and why you have some more confidence versus the prior quarters?\nBrad Hill: Yes, Neil, this is Brad. I'd say, first of all, we've continued to remain active in the acquisition space for the last few quarters. Certainly, pricing has been very frothy in that area. And so it's really hindered our ability to execute in that area. And we've said the last couple of quarters that we do think that opportunities will increase as we get later into the cycle and into this year. And generally, what we end up seeing is something changes, and something changes to drive the market a little bit closer to us where we -- where our execution capabilities are a little bit more valued. And I think what we're seeing right now is that play out a bit where our ability to execute via speed, where we're able to come in and close on an acquisition within really 30 days. Our ability to close all cash certainly becomes more valuable to some of the folks in the market. And certainly, we're seeing that at this point. We thought that, that would likely be the case this year. And I think just given some of the geopolitical things that are going on, the interest rate movements, as you referenced, are playing out, where we do believe that we'll be able to execute in that arena this year.\nNeil Malkin : Does that mean to do with potentially cap rates backing up at all? Or do you expect cap rates to be flat to even compress further?\nBrad Hill: We're really early. Interest rates have moved 100 basis points in the last 60 days. And so what I would say on cap rates is for well located, well executed properties. There's really no movement in cap rates. In fact, in the first quarter on the deals that we looked at, cap rates actually went down. Now that's the full quarter. That's likely not the case in March and April, where there have been some folks that high-levered buyers that have paused for the moment. But I would say that instead of getting 10 bids invest in finally, you're getting 4. And the deals that are well located, well executed, are still getting done. So I wouldn't say it's a result of cap rates changing. It's really a result of folks looking to certainty of execution more so than maximizing price. And I would say that where we are right now is bids have been blowing through the top end of broker guidance. Now they're getting the top end of their guidance. And deals are still getting done, especially for the asset types that we're selling and then the asset types that we're looking to buy.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Can you walk through where rent income ratios are currently? And any changes?\nTim Argo: Yes, Brad, this is Tim. If you look at our entire portfolio right now, rent income is about 23% that captures everybody that's in a unit right now. So it's gone up a little bit over the last couple of years, but still remaining fairly low and feel like there's still plenty of room to move in terms of our rent performance.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. And can you talk about where renewal offers are being sent out currently?\nTom Grimes: Sure, Brad. April is, I think I mentioned, is currently running 16.7%. May in the 17% range, and June in 16% right now. But June's a little early for full understanding. So they continue to be very robust.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt : So I was just trying to understand, I mean, we saw new leases now trending a little bit below renewals in the first quarter and a slight bit, I guess, in April. And you've seen average daily occupancy just now start to tick down here more recently. So I'm just trying to understand if this is a trend that you think you can -- that can persist for some time, or if there's been just now to the point where you're receiving some pushback on the renewal pricing and that may ultimately lead to need to, I guess, bring those down as we move through the year.\nTom Grimes: Yes. I'll tackle kind of the first part of that. And I wouldn't see anything that I would characterize as a slowdown. It is very steady. We're few weeks into April or wrapping up April at mid-16s. And I'll tell you, we've certainly gotten some pushback on renewal increases. But those folks that are leaving for price, we're replacing with someone paying 27% higher. So what we see on this is good accept rates for renewals, both in terms of the number of people that are renewing and the increase. We are seeing closure below and occupancy continues to run in a level that we're very comfortable running in our demand metrics on leads per exposed units are as high as they've been. So short term, we feel pretty darn good about where pricing is.\nEric Bolton: Austin, this is Eric. I'll also add that, obviously, we're just now getting into the peak leasing season and where demand tends to pick up and leasing traffic really tends to pick up. So I think the fact that we're carrying the sort of renewal rates that we are and the new lease rates that we are through the last 6 months of the fall and winter heading into now, the more robust part of the year, I'm feeling pretty good about the trends that we're seeing.\nAustin Wurschmidt : No, that's helpful. I guess just trying to understand, I guess, the opportunity cost or turnover cost associated if you're backfilling at a lower rent increase on average across the portfolio.\nTom Grimes: Just to -- yes. And so I think important to recognize we're backfilling, if you will, with someone paying 27% high and total turnover is down 6%. So we're not increasing turnover at this point, and we're repricing at a high rate on those folks that did choose to leave for price.\nAustin Wurschmidt : Understood. No, that's helpful color. And so what is market rent growth across the portfolio today? And could you give the current loss to lease.\nTim Argo: Yes, Austin, this is Tim. I'll hit the loss to lease part. So if you look at the blended rents for, call it, March compared to our March ERU, it would imply about 8% loss to lease. You got about $1,600 was our effective rents in March versus ERU of 14.84%. If you look at just the new lease prices where our absolute new lease prices are still running a little bit higher than renewals, it's actually about 10% based on that number.\nAustin Wurschmidt : And then as far as market rent growth, just curious where you are year-to-date? And I guess whether anything's changed as far as your projection across your markets for this year that led you to increase guidance 200 basis points this early in the year given we received guidance just a couple of months ago.\nBrad Hill: Austin, this is Brad. I'll start with that, and Tim and Tom can add some color if they want. I think what we saw was we had always expected going back to when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that we would have strength in the first quarter and begin to move into a situation where we have prior comp -- strong prior comps as well as the fourth quarter, some normal seasonal trends impact us that we didn't have last year. That general trend is still in our expectation, albeit the first quarter was just much stronger than we had. I mean pricing came in at 16%, you saw 16.8% for the quarter continued through April, as Tom mentioned, to be mid-16s, the same level. So I think that just went stronger and longer than we thought it would. So it caused us to expect the same continued shape of that curve for the year, given the comps was based, but just moved it up 200 basis points. And everything went up 200 basis points.\nEric Bolton: Austin, I'll add that as I alluded to and Tim or Tom mentioned as well, I mean our move-ins from people moving from outside the Sunbelt into our markets continues to grow. But the other thing that's changed, frankly, in the last 90, 120 days or so is with the change happening on mortgage rates and in interest rates. The hurdles to home buying just continue to grow. And I think that is continuing to fuel some level of demand for apartment housing as well that is running than we expected.\nBrad Hill: We do continue to have in the back half moving to a mid-single-digit kind of growth based on those prior year comps and that fourth quarter season we talked about, which is still strong on a relative basis in terms of years past, outside of the COVID period with that's still built into our -- we think we can do that, and we'll just have to see what performance is.\nAustin Wurschmidt : Is that mid-single-digit blended lease rate growth or same-store revenue growth?\nBrad Hill: Yes. Same store revenue growth will obviously -- will continue -- the math is math. It will accelerate next quarter and stay high through the year just based on what we've done in the last several quarters.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Brad, you talked about kind of the inflation and supply chain challenges with development. So as you think about the starts for later in the year, how much of construction costs moved, I don't know, either on a year-over-year basis or from earlier in the cycle just as you think of pricing those deals?\nBrad Hill: Yes. Nick, this is Brad. So yes, we build into all of our projections, depending on when we expect those projects to start some level of cost escalation, and I would say that varies based on the market. And I would say also that the cost increase that we've seen varies based on market. And I'll tell you, some markets right now are seeing cost increases that are pretty substantial. But I'll also point out that the way that we approach our developments and the way we underwrite our developments is pretty conservative. As I mentioned, we do keep in our underwritings, if we're going to start a project later this year, we've got cost escalation built in our construction costs, but we're also not trending rents until we get to that point. And based on what we're seeing in our markets across the board, there's significant level of rent increases occurring between now or when we put our project under contract and when we ultimately move to construction that we're not recognizing until we get to the point where we start construction. So we're conservative in how we underwrite these, and we do expect construction costs to continue to rise. When we started this year, we kind of expected a construction cost increase of, call it, 8% across the board. And I would say that that's probably increased to 10% or 12% this year.\nNicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And that's kind of my second question, right? So if you think about, obviously, rents have moved up pretty meaningfully as well. So when you blend that together, how does kind of the underwritten untrended deals look today for some of those projects versus when you initially contemplated this?\nBrad Hill: Yes. I mean the projects that we have today that are under construction actively. I think we're averaging about a 5.7% yield right now on our underwritten rents. And on those that are under construction, we have construction costs that are locked in on projects that we are modeling going forward. We continue to expect those yields to be in the, call it, 5.25%, 5.5% range. So there is some movement there. But when you compare that to still what we're seeing on the acquisition side, where the yields are 3% to 3.5%. The spreads continue to be in that 150 to 200 basis points range. And so we still continue to believe that taking into account the risk associated with development and the costs and all those things that, that 150 to 200 basis point spread is still a good place for us to be putting our capital.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Just going back to the guidance on the year, particularly on the 12% effective rent growth. I mean, I know you talked a little bit about this, but I'm honestly still a little bit confused. I mean if you did over 12% in the first quarter, within that, I really struggle to see how blended pricing would be below 10%, mid-single digits, as you said in the back half of the year and how you could still get to that 12% number for the year? I mean just any additional clarity on that would be helpful because it really feels like the blended pricing that's embedded in guidance on new and renewal leases is assumed to be pretty strong over the next couple of quarters.\nAl Campbell: This is Al, and I can try to address that, and maybe Tim and Tom can look at it some more. But I think it comes down basically to the fact that it takes our average leases a year. And so if you look at the trends in our pricing over the last several quarters, go back to 2021 and started the year lending pricing at 2.7% and went to 8%, 8% to 15%, 16% in the third and fourth quarter, and then we put another 16.8% up in the first quarter this year. So I think what we're -- though we expect our blended pricing to be impacted by the trends this year, both prior year comps and the seasonal trends we talked about, that strength that we put in for the last several quarters is going to play out for another few quarters. And so I think if you think about our leases in the average year, that math will play out. So I think there's -- what we would expect is that revenue, given the leasing that we've done in the last several quarters will continue to accelerate. It should continue to generate in the next quarter to be pretty strong over the remainder of the year given those mid-single-digit new pricing and blended pricing performance that we expect to put in the back half of the year. So that's how it works out, basically, you got to take in the context of your lease and how that's building up and then winding down over time.\nNick Yulico: Okay. I guess when you're saying that blended pricing getting down mid-single digits. Is that a fourth quarter issue? Or is there any of that in the third quarter as well?\nAl Campbell: Now we have to see what happens, Nick. Obviously, what we've projected as a strong second quarter continuing because we started off and so we started off, Tom talked about that's coming in, in the third quarter a good bit just because that's where the really -- if you go back to last year, that's when pricing really accelerated when we took off. So as the prior year comp at the quarter, you feel it. And then the fourth quarter has a little bit of prior year comp plus that season, so it's a little bit lower. So it's both of those, the average together is going to be in that mid-single-digit range for the second half.\nEric Bolton: And the other variable in all this to keep in mind, Nick, is that we're talking about blended assumptions here. But of course, what you see actually play out can vary a bit different between renewal pricing versus new lease pricing. And new lease pricing tends to be much more reflective of supply/demand dynamics going on in the market. But we've, as Tim has alluded to earlier, we've got some mark-to-market or capture to still continue to recover with our renewal pricing. And then if turnover stays low, and we continue to execute a higher level of renewal versus new lease pricing, it can change the outcome a bit. So what Al has laid out is sort of our best guess as to how things will play out over the back half of the year when you do consider the prior year comparisons are a little bit more challenging, and we are assuming a return to more seasonal patterns next year or later this year, which did not occur next year. But that mix between renewal and new lease pricing performance can change a little bit and that can create some variation in terms of the ultimate result we get.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: I just follow up on that line of questioning. So you're able to push rents 16% to 17% this quarter off a comp period where you had 8%. Third quarter of last year, you had 15%. So shouldn't your renewals be about 10% in the third quarter if market rents don't move?\nEric Bolton: Yes. That sounds low to me for renewal --\nTim Argo: I think renewals is kind of what's -- is where some of the opportunity is right now. I mean we're still in a situation where our new lease pricing is, call it, 2% or so. The absolute pricing is 2% or so higher than the absolute pricing we're getting on renewal. So that's kind of where we -- if you want to call it, return to seasonality, return to normalcies, those renewals catching up and then likely surpassing the new leases. So I do think the renewals will continue to be strong for quite a while.\nJohn Kim: At least 10%.\nTim Argo: I would say so.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Al, what's likely that you get an A- credit rating this year? It seems like your net debt to EBITDA will continue to improve on an LTM basis. And can you remind us what the impact would be on incremental cost of debt if you get that rating?\nAl Campbell: John, it's a great question. I think -- and of course, the markets are a bit volatile right now, both rates as well as spreads have gone up now because of some of the concerns about all the factors. But I think we certainly feel good about that deposit. I don't think we need to do anything else in terms of our balance sheet to make that happen. I think what we said is our long-term debt-to-EBITDA range is probably 4.5% to 5%, and we're below that now. I would say we have capacity for growth for some of the things that Brad is talking about. And so I think that we don't really need to do anything to let some time play out. I think there may be our boot would be there a little bit behind on catching up with the strength of the business, but we feel very good about where they are today. So we'll see what happens over the next few quarters. But hopefully, something happens there. We've already -- if you think about it, you should get about a 25 to 30 basis points impact on your borrowing costs say on average, a 10-year financing over time from going from a B to A rating. On our deals that we've done over the last couple of years, quite frankly, we've captured about half of that, John. I think we priced through a BBB+ rating and kind of move into -- almost touched A- at times and we got close. So we've captured about half, but I think we probably pick up another 15 basis points from here in a normal, stable market. The good thing is work that Andrew and the team has done, we really don't have much financing to do in this year. We only have $125 million coming due. So we'll be in the market very -- I don't plan to be in the market, as we talked about. But if we are and the rate income, we expect another 15 basis points increase what we would have been able to do.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Two questions. First, on the asset pricing and the center pool, I think earlier to some of the questions you said that instead of pricing through the top end, it's now pricing at the top end, and there are maybe a fewer hitters coming forth to buy deals. Does that mean that multifamily is losing its luster? Or is there just a lot more supply out there? Or is the capital that was going to multifamily now going to other sectors outside of, let's say, the classic industrial and multifamily that was all the rage in the past few years?\nBrad Hill: This is Brad. No, I certainly don't think folks are going away from multifamily. And in fact, just given the strength of the fundamentals and the broader trends and migration and job growth and things like that in our region of the country, we're seeing as much capital today as we've ever seen in this space and then in our region of the country. So no, it's not that at all. What I think that is, is a couple of things. One is the highly levered buyers are sitting on the sidelines at the moment, just trying to figure out what levers they're going to pull to try to get back into the market. Interest rates have moved so quickly for those folks that they're entering these deals at a negative leverage position, the rent growth that's in place in our region of the country helps them overcome that. So that's really what it is at the moment. It's not a reallocation of capital. It's not capital moving to sectors or anything of that nature at this point. It is simply folks on the sideline at the time being is the first point. The second point is that there has been a flood of projects, deals come to market in March and April. Folks were trying to get ahead of some of the interest rate movements. So there has been a flood of deals that have come to market, frankly. And so I think that part has dispersed the buyer pool a bit amongst these deals. So that's the second component that I would say is limiting the buyer pool on individual deals. But in terms of the entire market, no, I don't think capital has moved away from this sector at all.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is on gas prices. Are you seeing any impact on your residents? There are some people who say, because the Sunbelt is heavy drive and because of lower relativity customers the coastal markets, gas prices are a bigger deal. The offset is most of your residents I'm guessing are single and are probably more concerned about their beer budget than their gas budget. So just curious, if gas prices have any impact on your renters or if it's really just -- I don't let this nonissue, but sort of a nonissue?\nTom Grimes: I'd say it's a nonissue. It's one of many factors going on. And I think when you stack up sort of the different regions of the company or even the different of the country or even our submarkets, we're seeing steady performance in pricing, whether it's inner loop downtown walkable asset or a suburban asset with a drop. So just not seeing much on that on the renter side of things.\nEric Bolton: And Alex, we're also seeing wage growth take place at a pretty robust pace as well. So a combination of what's happening on the employment side and wages, I think, has muted any negative impact on the rise in gas prices so far.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: A couple of follow-ups here. I guess I heard you earlier mentioned that some markets are seeing very substantial development cost increases. I guess I'm curious which markets are those cost increases standing up more so and why more than other markets?\nBrad Hill: Yes. I mean 2 that I can think of are Denver and Phoenix and really those are more because they're kind of islands on their own, frankly, in terms of the sub trade base and the GC base. You consider Texas, where you've got Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. All those markets, contractors really go to all those markets, but that's not the case when you get into a market like Denver and Phoenix, they're more islands unto themselves. So your base of -- your pool is a little bit more limited. So you have a different impact in those markets.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Okay. On the development pipeline overall, you mentioned getting to about $1 billion by year-end that you're still within your -- I think, your comfort threshold. I guess I'm curious how much larger could you be willing to go that pipeline to, especially if you now factor in the rising rates and the supply -- increasing supply projects to come across Sunbelt over next year or 2?\nAl Campbell: We talked about in the past, Haendel, that we talk about 4% and 5% of our balance sheet kind of being the tolerance limit. We're well below that now. So we could go -- that's $1 billion to being 4 would be no problem for us given the surface line. Certainly, we're thinking about the marketplace and how things shape up. But our balance sheet is -- our leverage is very low as we talked about how we look at it. We're below our sort of our leverage thresholds right now with plenty of capacity. And so we have only a runway to continue funding in a market that's changing. So that's how we think about it.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And then one more, if you would mind just sharing some updated color on D.C. and Houston to your software market. I'm curious how those markets are faring its expectations coming into the year? And is there any  optimism and maybe pessimism as you kind of think about this market .\nTom Grimes: Haendel, D.C. is now 10.5% on blended rent for April. And Houston is 9.6%. So if we were 3 years ago, I would be telling you how well they were doing, but those are improving. They've improved over time. They probably moved from the mid 4s. It's just that, that still puts them at the lower end of our portfolio's growth rate. So they're improving modestly, I would say.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Anthony Powell from Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: So your rental growth and lease spreads have been higher than a single family for the past few quarters, which is good. But in a lot of cases, now some of your monthly rents are converging with single family. So do you see that as a risk as single-family inventory increases? And could that be maybe a potential just headwind as you have maybe larger, I guess, homes available at both semi/full rents to what you're offering?\nTom Grimes: No. I mean there's just no threat at all. In fact, our in-house is, I mean, down 117 move-outs and is now just 3.2% of our reason for move-out. So it's a total nonfactor. And home buying, as you would expect, is down close to 23%. It's now just 18% of our move-out. So the affordability in those areas seems to be driving people to stay, and that's a big part of our production in turnover.\nTim Argo: I might add one point to that, that even with the rate increases we've been seeing, our new lease rates are up about 30% over the last 2 years. But single-family home prices in our markets is up almost 40% over that same period. So relative affordability has actually got lower for single-family than it was a couple of years ago.\nAnthony Powell: Sorry, I was a referring to single-family rents, I guess. I was looking at one of the large rental peers and looking at a market like Atlanta or Tampa. It seems like the actual monthly rents .\nTom Grimes: Yes. And to be clear, move-out to rent increase is now down to 3.2% of our move-outs is at 100 basis points lower. So nonfactor there.\nEric Bolton: Yes. I think that, Anthony, it's also important to recognize, as Tom is alluding to, competition that we may have from people choosing to rent a home versus rent an apartment. I mean, it's just -- it's a nonfactor for us, and I think it really is a nonfactor because people are making a choice for renting housing based on a lifestyle need. And given the demographic that we're serving and the demographic that defines our resident profile, these are not people that are choosing or want or desire the single-family lifestyle. They want the apartment lifestyle. So we just do not and never have really seen it as being a problem comparison.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. That's clear. And just one more. I guess, one of the multifamily peers yesterday said that they're seeing just older tenured tenants in certain markets like Tampa move out as pricing increases? Are you seeing the same thing? And does that kind of factor into how you price in renewals in any of the markets?\nTom Grimes: And then affect how we price on renewals and our average length of stay has stayed consistent at about 20 months. So we're not seeing a real material change on that point. And we're so consistent with our renewal increases that the renewal people that have renewed, they're not generally that behind, it's more the new move-ins that are getting that higher increase.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney.\nRob Stevenson: Average same-store rents $14.69 a month. Where are monthly fees per unit today? And what type of growth rates are you passing through with fees? I assume it's not anywhere near the rental rate growth levels of mid-teens?\nTom Grimes: I mean, no, it is not. And that is -- those run from $100 and $150 a month, and they run more in the 3% to 4% range.\nRob Stevenson: Are you seeing lower application fees given the lower turnover?\nBrad Hill: Sorry, say that again, Rob?\nRob Stevenson: Are you seeing any decrease in application fees given the higher occupancy and the lower turnover, so just less units available in your portfolio. And so therefore, you're getting lower application fees that are pushing down fees a little bit in aggregate across the portfolio.\nTom Grimes: No, not materially. And fees are actually up a little bit as we've gotten back to more normalized operating conditions on things like late fees and term fees.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then some of your peers have been talking about earning into 2023. So rental rates continue at current levels at the current trajectory through the prime leasing season. How much it baked in same-store growth is there going to be locked in for 2023 as we exit 2022? I think the peers have been talking about 3% to 4% in their portfolios for 2023 even if rents didn't increase from here. How are you guys thinking about that, the sort of where these leases are going to set you up for 2023 as a base?\nTim Argo: Rob, this is Tim. I'll answer that certainly in terms of the guidance that we have for the rest of the year. The way we kind of look at it is that the blend of lease and release that we expect to get from the full year, roughly half of that should pretty much carry into the next year. So I think I guess a little more than that, I would call it somewhere around 5% now based on our guidance if pricing holds up better than we think, and certainly, that will impact that number as well. So every day that goes by, it helps us in '22, but also sets us up for '23 as well.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then one quick one. How much of your redevelopment is being done by internal MAA staff these days versus contracted third parties? .\nTom Grimes: On the interior innovated, it's primarily a contractor base that's coming in and doing the countertops and cabinetry and flooring in those items. We do a little bit of the paying in-house, but it's primarily a contract process and always has been.\nRob Stevenson: And is that an impediment at this point of getting that labor? Or are you guys still getting as much done as you want to at this point?\nTom Grimes: It's not an impediment at all, much like Brad has outlined in his comments about construction, we've seen some rate increase there, but the price opportunity that we're seeing from the markets is better. And then, of course, new supplies come into our markets, and that's given us additional opportunity to grow it to a higher price point. So there's -- I would say there's some expense there, but it's not affecting the economics or saw in us down.\nOperator: And we do have a follow-up question from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: One more development question. One of your apartment peers entered the SFR development business this past quarter doing attached product, I think, in Houston. I guess I'm curious, one, if you have any plans to do so anything in the pipeline that perhaps contemplates an SFR development? And what's your thoughts overall on maybe adding that to your -- that type of product to your pipeline?\nEric Bolton: Haendel, it's Eric. The short answer is no. It's not something that we plan to jump on. We have spent a fair amount of time looking at it. We have studied a good bid over the last couple of years and have ultimately concluded that frankly, we can capture margin expansion and -- from the portfolio and earnings upside, we think, from the existing -- from our operations just through continuing to focus on the multifamily product that we have. And I -- and certainly, the -- some of the things that we're doing with new technology and so forth, which is a lot of it obviously is being used in the single-family space as well. But when you apply it to our more condensed, if you will, apartment communities, where you've got 250 units often with shared structure and much more efficient from a CapEx perspective, we just ultimately believe and have concluded after studying a lot that we're better off to just stick to our knitting and stay focused on the apartment product. And certainly, as we continue to look at ramping up our external growth, we've got plenty of investment opportunity and plenty of growth opportunity, we think, by focusing again on what we really know which is multifamily. So again, the answer is no, we're content to focus as we are.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: What are you hearing these days on the subject of rent control? We've seen increasing dialogue here. We've seen rent margins in Atlanta and kind of with election coming around later this year. Basically, how are you thinking about managing this dynamic? Do you see heightened risk going into 2023 if 2022 was basically, let's say, done at this point from anything material transpiring from a rent control standpoint? .\nRobert DelPriore: Chan, this is Rob. I'll start and then maybe turn it over to Tim and Al. But so across our markets, 13 of our states that represent about 90% of our NOI actually have in place state laws that prohibit rent control at a local level. So with that starting as a backdrop to it, it's very difficult to get rent control imposed across our portfolio. So we have a group that is active in monitoring these along with the various apartment associations and trade industries that we're part of. So don't really anticipate any significant impact from rent control across any of our markets.\nEric Bolton: No, I'll add to what Rob is saying is what Tim alluded to earlier, with rent to income and our portfolio now running around 23%, it's still a very affordable level of rent relative to income that we are at right now. And most economists will tell you, once you get to 30% or better or higher, that you start to run into a problem. So a combination of just the environment we find ourselves in, the issues and the fact that a lot of our states we operate really prohibit it, we just -- and the affordable nature of our product and relative to income. We're just not seeing any real evidence that we're at risk of any sort of meaningful efforts towards rent control or regulations to try to keep that in check.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. And a quick follow-up. So earlier on one of the questions, you talked about 2023 in terms of where you are from capturing that loss to lease standpoint, you expect basically that going into 2023, you're looking at a 5% pricing for now. So big picture kind of thinking about where you guys were pre-pandemic. When do you think the market gets back to that 3.5%, 4%?\nEric Bolton: I don't know. I think that it's going to vary a bit by region of the country and by market. From where we sit here today, and I think about the fundamentals that are driving demand for housing in the Sunbelt largely as a function of the job growth that we are seeing and increasing embracing by employers of some level of remote working. And I think that's going to be with us for many years to come. I just -- it's -- I see the demand side of the equation for our business as continuing to be quite strong in our markets for some time. And then I'll overlay on that, the pressures that Brad has been alluding to surrounding construction costs and development and the ability to secure effectively, in many ways, we are at kind of full capacity at the moment in terms of the ability for developers and construction companies to deliver supply. So I think -- I mean, our biggest challenge, frankly, is just the prior year comparisons. It's -- and of course, that will -- we have that this year. And then going into next year, it will be more steady. But I think that as I think about a return to normal from a rent growth perspective, as you're framing it up, it's hard to see that happening over the next 2 or 3 years. I think we're in a very unique window right now where I think the only thing that could change that, the only thing that could really weaken that is if we do, in fact, see the country slip into some form of a recession, and job growth begins to significantly slow and we go into a real downturn in the economy, which, of course, will affect everyone. But historically, of course, MAA has shown the ability to weather those downturns better than most. And again, I think a lot of that comes back to the markets and the way that we are uniquely diversified across the Sunbelt and the more affordable nature of our product. So I think that my answer is fundamentally that I think the conditions are likely to remain pretty bullish for quite some time. And the only thing you can really materially weaken that would be a significant downturn in the economy, a recession, if you will. And even in that scenario on a relative or comparative basis. I like our story in that kind of scenario.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Rich Anderson from SMBC.\nRich Anderson : So speaking of recession, so the GDP print for the first quarter, surprising down 1.4%. How do you -- you speak about some of the protection that MAA has offered in the past about tougher economic climates. But I mean, is there a reason to be thinking out a couple of years or a year about all the good things that are happening today and being careful not to have sort of a hangover when this is all said and done because I might argue that this is not a forever thing. And Karma that you know what? So how do you manage this in light of the broader economic environment and the changes that are going on?\nEric Bolton: Well, Rich, it's a good question. And frankly, it's something we've been spending a fair amount of time thinking about because I do agree with you that -- I mean, one thing we know is the economy is cyclical and our business is cyclical. And I think that while it's hard for me to sit here today and see any reason to get particularly definitive about a downturn. There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and there's changes afoot. But as we think about how do we position the company and prepare for an eventual downturn, there really has always been 4 things that we have really focused our energy and efforts on. One is just the portfolio strategy itself and ensuring that we are focused in markets that we think can weather downturns better than other regions and other markets in the country. We think that the price point that we have in the portfolio relative to others is an advantage to us should we find ourselves in that kind of situation. And as you know, we are a bit uniquely diversified also across the Sunbelt and that we have exposure to a number of secondary markets as well as the larger markets as well. And that balance and that diversification across the region, unique to our story, I think, really is one of the things that we're going to continue to hold on to and to protect as we think about cycling capital and growing the company. The other thing that I would -- we focus on, of course, is the balance sheet and the capacity we have on the balance sheet, and you've now it's a long time, Rich. I mean our balance sheet has never been this strong. We've never had this much capacity. So we think we've got that position about as well as we can. The other thing is we continue to monitor very carefully about how much forward funding obligation we're creating for ourselves through new development. And as Al alluded to, we feel like that no more than 4% to 5% is kind of where we want to be. Right now, we're well below that and continue and certainly intend to stay there. So we -- while we've scaled up a fair amount, we're still in a very comfortable position such that if the capital markets close for some reason, we feel very confident that we can continue to complete all the obligations that we've created. And then the final thing I'll point to, if you were to tell me a year from now that we for sure were going to recession, what would you be doing from an operational perspective, I would tell you we're doing exactly that. This is the time to be pushing for rents. When you get into a recession, the thing that will cause revenues to hold up better than they otherwise would is that you've got baked in performance in your revenues through the rent growth that you've been capturing over the prior year or so. So we think that this is for a host of reasons, is a good time to continue to be prioritizing rent growth over occupancy. And if you want to think about a recession, for sure, that's what we should be doing, which is obviously what we are doing now.\nRich Anderson : Okay. And then second question for me is about an hour ago, you talked about 14% of your leasing came from someplace else into the Sunbelt. But your urban peers are also claiming in migration to these days. So everyone's got immigration. It's a party. It's a migration party. And my question to you is that the 14% of leasing only tells half the story. Because what about the people that did not renew and are leaving your portfolio, where are they going? And so I wonder if you know, perhaps the net is a positive inbound to Sunbelt. I'm not going to argue that. But I wonder if there's -- the back door is opening up a little bit as people perhaps are looking to the urban world and saying, maybe I can get myself a deal someplace else or get a big paying job or whatever the case may be. Is that something you monitor the back door and where people are going, not where people are coming from?\nTom Grimes: Yes. Rich, we do. And move-outs, who moved outside the Sunbelt area were just 4.3%, but less the area, and that's down from 4.5% last year. And it's not big enough that I've spent much time trying to figure out where they're going. So -- and that is pretty big in our favor.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.\nTayo Okusanya: My question is more around innovation and technology. Hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're doing in that area? And ultimately, what kind of margin expansion you expect from these initiatives that may be comfortable that they're all positive MPV projects.\nTom Grimes: Sure, Tayo, and I'll take the first part and kick it over to Tim to cover the margin expansion. But we've -- currently, what has either occurred or is in process as we expanded our call center solution. We've implemented lead nurturing software, which is automated prospecting engagement technology that interacts with our prospects earlier. It allows us to automate follow-ups. We've upgraded virtual touring. We've added a prospect-centric CRM. We've added mobile maintenance and mobile inspections. These changes just so far have allowed us to restructure 30 physicians in the office staff in 2021 that's benefiting us in '22. We're also getting better clarity on billing and higher resident satisfaction as a result of the inspection process. And then underway right now is improved self-touring, improved multi-location sales support, simplified online leasing, and we expect another 30 to 50 headcount reduction in '22, that will benefit '23. And then Tim can talk about -- a little bit about the margin expansion.\nTim Argo: Yes. So regarding the margin, at least for 2022, we're expecting our total margin to go up somewhere between 150 and 175 basis points. Obviously, a lot of different factors playing into that, but a lot of the components, Tom mentioned, are included there. And so smart homes, one, for sure, the installations we're doing there that we can see on the top line. That's probably contributing 40 basis points or so this year to the margin. And then some of the efficiencies on the headcount side, the call center, the automated chat are contributing a piece of that as well. I think some of the foundational things we're doing now with the CRM that's currently getting rolled out and some of the other things that Tom mentioned will have more of an impact as we get into '23, and we'll define that more definitively as we move out to the next few months.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will now return the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone hanging with us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, obviously, just feel free to reach out to us at any point. So thanks for joining us this morning.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. MAA continues to capture robust leasing conditions across our portfolio, and we are carrying strong momentum in rent growth into the summer leasing season. Leasing traffic remains high, solid job growth, accelerating migration trends to our Sunbelt markets and the higher pricing hurdles for single-family ownership continue to fuel strong demand for apartment housing. Almost 14% of the new leases we wrote in the first quarter came from move-ins relocating to the Sunbelt. This is an increase of 190 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Resident turnover continues to remain low with move-outs further declining by close to 6% as compared to Q1 of last year. These trends continue to support our ability to capture strong rent growth. The rents in place at quarter end within the same-store portfolio were on average 12.4% higher on a comparable basis to the prior year. And encouragingly, the new leases that went into effect in the first quarter were 16.8% higher than the expiring leases. Pricing momentum remains strong heading into the important summer leasing period. Our largest pressures on property operating expenses were with personnel costs and repair and maintenance expenses as the tight labor market, inflationary pressures and supply chain issues make an impact. But with the strong top line performance, we continue to see strong NOI growth. And as detailed in our earnings release, we have increased our performance expectations for the full year. Our new development pipeline continues to perform very well with 5 of the projects now actively leasing and capturing rents that are higher than assumed in our projections. As detailed in the earnings release, we have 3 other developments under construction that we expect to start leasing late this year. In addition to the development detailed in the earnings release, we are also expecting to break ground on another 3 projects later this year located in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver. We're excited with the strong start to the year. Leasing conditions clearly remain very favorable. We have a number of initiatives underway with new technologies and redevelopment that will further fuel margin expansion and higher earnings growth from our existing portfolio and expanding new development pipeline will add -- will also fuel additional FFO growth over the next 2 to 3 years and the balance sheet is in a strong position to support our growth plans. MAA strategy has consistently demonstrated more resilient performance during weaker parts of the economic cycle. But as a consequence of the many enhancements we've made over the past few years to the portfolio mix, to the operating platform, to the balance sheet and to our external growth capabilities, we're excited to now also see MAA's ability to post strong relative performance during recovery and the up parts of the market cycle. In closing, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our team of MAA associates for their continued hard work and consistently strong performance. I thought I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad. Austin, this is Eric. I'll also add that, obviously, we're just now getting into the peak leasing season and where demand tends to pick up and leasing traffic really tends to pick up. So I think the fact that we're carrying the sort of renewal rates that we are and the new lease rates that we are through the last 6 months of the fall and winter heading into now, the more robust part of the year, I'm feeling pretty good about the trends that we're seeing. Austin, I'll add that as I alluded to and Tim or Tom mentioned as well, I mean our move-ins from people moving from outside the Sunbelt into our markets continues to grow. But the other thing that's changed, frankly, in the last 90, 120 days or so is with the change happening on mortgage rates and in interest rates. The hurdles to home buying just continue to grow. And I think that is continuing to fuel some level of demand for apartment housing as well that is running than we expected. And the other variable in all this to keep in mind, Nick, is that we're talking about blended assumptions here. But of course, what you see actually play out can vary a bit different between renewal pricing versus new lease pricing. And new lease pricing tends to be much more reflective of supply/demand dynamics going on in the market. But we've, as Tim has alluded to earlier, we've got some mark-to-market or capture to still continue to recover with our renewal pricing. And then if turnover stays low, and we continue to execute a higher level of renewal versus new lease pricing, it can change the outcome a bit. So what Al has laid out is sort of our best guess as to how things will play out over the back half of the year when you do consider the prior year comparisons are a little bit more challenging, and we are assuming a return to more seasonal patterns next year or later this year, which did not occur next year. But that mix between renewal and new lease pricing performance can change a little bit and that can create some variation in terms of the ultimate result we get. Yes. That sounds low to me for renewal -- And Alex, we're also seeing wage growth take place at a pretty robust pace as well. So a combination of what's happening on the employment side and wages, I think, has muted any negative impact on the rise in gas prices so far. Yes. I think that, Anthony, it's also important to recognize, as Tom is alluding to, competition that we may have from people choosing to rent a home versus rent an apartment. I mean, it's just -- it's a nonfactor for us, and I think it really is a nonfactor because people are making a choice for renting housing based on a lifestyle need. And given the demographic that we're serving and the demographic that defines our resident profile, these are not people that are choosing or want or desire the single-family lifestyle. They want the apartment lifestyle. So we just do not and never have really seen it as being a problem comparison. Haendel, it's Eric. The short answer is no. It's not something that we plan to jump on. We have spent a fair amount of time looking at it. We have studied a good bid over the last couple of years and have ultimately concluded that frankly, we can capture margin expansion and -- from the portfolio and earnings upside, we think, from the existing -- from our operations just through continuing to focus on the multifamily product that we have. And I -- and certainly, the -- some of the things that we're doing with new technology and so forth, which is a lot of it obviously is being used in the single-family space as well. But when you apply it to our more condensed, if you will, apartment communities, where you've got 250 units often with shared structure and much more efficient from a CapEx perspective, we just ultimately believe and have concluded after studying a lot that we're better off to just stick to our knitting and stay focused on the apartment product. And certainly, as we continue to look at ramping up our external growth, we've got plenty of investment opportunity and plenty of growth opportunity, we think, by focusing again on what we really know which is multifamily. So again, the answer is no, we're content to focus as we are. No, I'll add to what Rob is saying is what Tim alluded to earlier, with rent to income and our portfolio now running around 23%, it's still a very affordable level of rent relative to income that we are at right now. And most economists will tell you, once you get to 30% or better or higher, that you start to run into a problem. So a combination of just the environment we find ourselves in, the issues and the fact that a lot of our states we operate really prohibit it, we just -- and the affordable nature of our product and relative to income. We're just not seeing any real evidence that we're at risk of any sort of meaningful efforts towards rent control or regulations to try to keep that in check. I don't know. I think that it's going to vary a bit by region of the country and by market. From where we sit here today, and I think about the fundamentals that are driving demand for housing in the Sunbelt largely as a function of the job growth that we are seeing and increasing embracing by employers of some level of remote working. And I think that's going to be with us for many years to come. I just -- it's -- I see the demand side of the equation for our business as continuing to be quite strong in our markets for some time. And then I'll overlay on that, the pressures that Brad has been alluding to surrounding construction costs and development and the ability to secure effectively, in many ways, we are at kind of full capacity at the moment in terms of the ability for developers and construction companies to deliver supply. So I think -- I mean, our biggest challenge, frankly, is just the prior year comparisons. It's -- and of course, that will -- we have that this year. And then going into next year, it will be more steady. But I think that as I think about a return to normal from a rent growth perspective, as you're framing it up, it's hard to see that happening over the next 2 or 3 years. I think we're in a very unique window right now where I think the only thing that could change that, the only thing that could really weaken that is if we do, in fact, see the country slip into some form of a recession, and job growth begins to significantly slow and we go into a real downturn in the economy, which, of course, will affect everyone. But historically, of course, MAA has shown the ability to weather those downturns better than most. And again, I think a lot of that comes back to the markets and the way that we are uniquely diversified across the Sunbelt and the more affordable nature of our product. So I think that my answer is fundamentally that I think the conditions are likely to remain pretty bullish for quite some time. And the only thing you can really materially weaken that would be a significant downturn in the economy, a recession, if you will. And even in that scenario on a relative or comparative basis. I like our story in that kind of scenario. Well, Rich, it's a good question. And frankly, it's something we've been spending a fair amount of time thinking about because I do agree with you that -- I mean, one thing we know is the economy is cyclical and our business is cyclical. And I think that while it's hard for me to sit here today and see any reason to get particularly definitive about a downturn. There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and there's changes afoot. But as we think about how do we position the company and prepare for an eventual downturn, there really has always been 4 things that we have really focused our energy and efforts on. One is just the portfolio strategy itself and ensuring that we are focused in markets that we think can weather downturns better than other regions and other markets in the country. We think that the price point that we have in the portfolio relative to others is an advantage to us should we find ourselves in that kind of situation. And as you know, we are a bit uniquely diversified also across the Sunbelt and that we have exposure to a number of secondary markets as well as the larger markets as well. And that balance and that diversification across the region, unique to our story, I think, really is one of the things that we're going to continue to hold on to and to protect as we think about cycling capital and growing the company. The other thing that I would -- we focus on, of course, is the balance sheet and the capacity we have on the balance sheet, and you've now it's a long time, Rich. I mean our balance sheet has never been this strong. We've never had this much capacity. So we think we've got that position about as well as we can. The other thing is we continue to monitor very carefully about how much forward funding obligation we're creating for ourselves through new development. And as Al alluded to, we feel like that no more than 4% to 5% is kind of where we want to be. Right now, we're well below that and continue and certainly intend to stay there. So we -- while we've scaled up a fair amount, we're still in a very comfortable position such that if the capital markets close for some reason, we feel very confident that we can continue to complete all the obligations that we've created. And then the final thing I'll point to, if you were to tell me a year from now that we for sure were going to recession, what would you be doing from an operational perspective, I would tell you we're doing exactly that. This is the time to be pushing for rents. When you get into a recession, the thing that will cause revenues to hold up better than they otherwise would is that you've got baked in performance in your revenues through the rent growth that you've been capturing over the prior year or so. So we think that this is for a host of reasons, is a good time to continue to be prioritizing rent growth over occupancy. And if you want to think about a recession, for sure, that's what we should be doing, which is obviously what we are doing now. Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone hanging with us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, obviously, just feel free to reach out to us at any point. So thanks for joining us this morning."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress towards growing our new development pipeline. We finished the first quarter with $444 million under construction and $740 million combined under construction and in lease-up at an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%. The size of our total pipeline is up from $700 million at the end of 2021. During the first quarter, we started construction on a 352-unit project in Denver called MAA Park Central. This is the first phase of a 3-phase 1,000-unit project on land we purchased in late 2020. Predevelopment work at our 3 young sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver is progressing. And subject to receiving acceptable construction costs, we expect to start construction on these projects this year. Additionally, we continue predevelopment work on several in-house and prepurchase developments that we hope to start over the next 18 months in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. This pool of future development opportunities includes an entitled site in Denver that we purchased in the first quarter of this year. The timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes. But at this time, we expect to start construction on 1,600 to 1,800 units in 2022 and end the year with a pipeline of under-construction projects between $800 million and $900 million and a pipeline of total projects both under construction and in lease-up over $1 billion. Our operating performance at communities and their initial lease-up is strong, and we're achieving rents substantially above our pro forma expectations. Reflective of the strong leasing demand in our markets, we reached stabilization at our MAA Midtown Phoenix community 2 quarters earlier than our original expectation, while also achieving stabilized effective rents more than 7.5% above our original pro forma expectations. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job keeping labor and material cost increases from having an impact on our overall budgets. Material shortages and shipping delays are prevalent in the market today. And in many instances, necessitate us placing orders and making deposits much earlier in the process than we had to in the past to secure materials as well as our place in the delivery queue. Despite these challenges, we delivered our last units at both MAA  and MAA Park Point on time during the first quarter. Our 2022 disposition plan is underway with 2 properties in the Fort Worth market currently under contract with an expected closing date later in the second quarter. Buyer interest was strong for these 30-year-old properties with one buyer winning the opportunity to purchase both. We plan to sell 2 additional properties later in the year. Our transaction team also remains engaged in the transaction market, and we're actively evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and we continue to believe that as we get later in the year, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties are likely to materialize. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Yes, Neil, this is Brad. I'd say, first of all, we've continued to remain active in the acquisition space for the last few quarters. Certainly, pricing has been very frothy in that area. And so it's really hindered our ability to execute in that area. And we've said the last couple of quarters that we do think that opportunities will increase as we get later into the cycle and into this year. And generally, what we end up seeing is something changes, and something changes to drive the market a little bit closer to us where we -- where our execution capabilities are a little bit more valued. And I think what we're seeing right now is that play out a bit where our ability to execute via speed, where we're able to come in and close on an acquisition within really 30 days. Our ability to close all cash certainly becomes more valuable to some of the folks in the market. And certainly, we're seeing that at this point. We thought that, that would likely be the case this year. And I think just given some of the geopolitical things that are going on, the interest rate movements, as you referenced, are playing out, where we do believe that we'll be able to execute in that arena this year. We're really early. Interest rates have moved 100 basis points in the last 60 days. And so what I would say on cap rates is for well located, well executed properties. There's really no movement in cap rates. In fact, in the first quarter on the deals that we looked at, cap rates actually went down. Now that's the full quarter. That's likely not the case in March and April, where there have been some folks that high-levered buyers that have paused for the moment. But I would say that instead of getting 10 bids invest in finally, you're getting 4. And the deals that are well located, well executed, are still getting done. So I wouldn't say it's a result of cap rates changing. It's really a result of folks looking to certainty of execution more so than maximizing price. And I would say that where we are right now is bids have been blowing through the top end of broker guidance. Now they're getting the top end of their guidance. And deals are still getting done, especially for the asset types that we're selling and then the asset types that we're looking to buy. Austin, this is Brad. I'll start with that, and Tim and Tom can add some color if they want. I think what we saw was we had always expected going back to when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that we would have strength in the first quarter and begin to move into a situation where we have prior comp -- strong prior comps as well as the fourth quarter, some normal seasonal trends impact us that we didn't have last year. That general trend is still in our expectation, albeit the first quarter was just much stronger than we had. I mean pricing came in at 16%, you saw 16.8% for the quarter continued through April, as Tom mentioned, to be mid-16s, the same level. So I think that just went stronger and longer than we thought it would. So it caused us to expect the same continued shape of that curve for the year, given the comps was based, but just moved it up 200 basis points. And everything went up 200 basis points. We do continue to have in the back half moving to a mid-single-digit kind of growth based on those prior year comps and that fourth quarter season we talked about, which is still strong on a relative basis in terms of years past, outside of the COVID period with that's still built into our -- we think we can do that, and we'll just have to see what performance is. Yes. Same store revenue growth will obviously -- will continue -- the math is math. It will accelerate next quarter and stay high through the year just based on what we've done in the last several quarters. Yes. Nick, this is Brad. So yes, we build into all of our projections, depending on when we expect those projects to start some level of cost escalation, and I would say that varies based on the market. And I would say also that the cost increase that we've seen varies based on market. And I'll tell you, some markets right now are seeing cost increases that are pretty substantial. But I'll also point out that the way that we approach our developments and the way we underwrite our developments is pretty conservative. As I mentioned, we do keep in our underwritings, if we're going to start a project later this year, we've got cost escalation built in our construction costs, but we're also not trending rents until we get to that point. And based on what we're seeing in our markets across the board, there's significant level of rent increases occurring between now or when we put our project under contract and when we ultimately move to construction that we're not recognizing until we get to the point where we start construction. So we're conservative in how we underwrite these, and we do expect construction costs to continue to rise. When we started this year, we kind of expected a construction cost increase of, call it, 8% across the board. And I would say that that's probably increased to 10% or 12% this year. Yes. I mean the projects that we have today that are under construction actively. I think we're averaging about a 5.7% yield right now on our underwritten rents. And on those that are under construction, we have construction costs that are locked in on projects that we are modeling going forward. We continue to expect those yields to be in the, call it, 5.25%, 5.5% range. So there is some movement there. But when you compare that to still what we're seeing on the acquisition side, where the yields are 3% to 3.5%. The spreads continue to be in that 150 to 200 basis points range. And so we still continue to believe that taking into account the risk associated with development and the costs and all those things that, that 150 to 200 basis point spread is still a good place for us to be putting our capital. This is Brad. No, I certainly don't think folks are going away from multifamily. And in fact, just given the strength of the fundamentals and the broader trends and migration and job growth and things like that in our region of the country, we're seeing as much capital today as we've ever seen in this space and then in our region of the country. So no, it's not that at all. What I think that is, is a couple of things. One is the highly levered buyers are sitting on the sidelines at the moment, just trying to figure out what levers they're going to pull to try to get back into the market. Interest rates have moved so quickly for those folks that they're entering these deals at a negative leverage position, the rent growth that's in place in our region of the country helps them overcome that. So that's really what it is at the moment. It's not a reallocation of capital. It's not capital moving to sectors or anything of that nature at this point. It is simply folks on the sideline at the time being is the first point. The second point is that there has been a flood of projects, deals come to market in March and April. Folks were trying to get ahead of some of the interest rate movements. So there has been a flood of deals that have come to market, frankly. And so I think that part has dispersed the buyer pool a bit amongst these deals. So that's the second component that I would say is limiting the buyer pool on individual deals. But in terms of the entire market, no, I don't think capital has moved away from this sector at all. Yes. I mean 2 that I can think of are Denver and Phoenix and really those are more because they're kind of islands on their own, frankly, in terms of the sub trade base and the GC base. You consider Texas, where you've got Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. All those markets, contractors really go to all those markets, but that's not the case when you get into a market like Denver and Phoenix, they're more islands unto themselves. So your base of -- your pool is a little bit more limited. So you have a different impact in those markets. Sorry, say that again, Rob?"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Al Campbell",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $1.97 was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. And virtually all of the outperformance came from revenue growth as rental pricing, occupancy and collections all combined to produce 150 basis points of outperformance to our revenue expectation for the quarter. As Tom outlined, pricing trends continue to be strong through the first quarter and into April, as both new leases and renewals becoming effective during the quarter through solid double-digit growth over the prior lease. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong rent growth through this year and with some impact from prior year comps and returned to more normal seasonal patterns during the fourth quarter leasing season, which did not occur last year. Overall, same-store operating expenses were in line with expectations for the quarter, but we do expect continued inflationary pressure over the remainder of the year and particularly in personnel and maintenance costs, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection for market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We funded approximately $43 million of development costs during the quarter towards trajected $250 million funding for the full year. As Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to start several new deals this year and early next year, likely expanding our total construction pipeline to between $800 million to $1 billion by year-end, which remains well within our risk tolerance limits. We ended the quarter with low leverage. Our debt to EBITDA had a record low 4.27x, with virtually all of our debt fixed and well laddered over an average of 8.4 years and with $1 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity remaining under our line of credit. Also during the quarter, Moody's affirmed our debt rating of Baa1 and revised their outlook from stable to positive, bringing all 3 rating agencies now to a positive outlook. And this certainly reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the potential for upgraded ratings over the next several quarters. And finally, given the first quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.16 per share at the midpoint to $7.92 to $8.24 per share or $8.08 at the midpoint. This represents a 13% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all produced by higher revenue growth expectations as projected to continued strong pricing trends produce a 200 basis points increase in our effective rent growth, our expectation for the year to 12% at the midpoint compared to 10% in our prior guidance and 5.2% for the prior year performance. As mentioned, our revenue projection for the full year is built on continued solid pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some impact from prior year comps of the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. The trends with our property operating expenses remained largely in line with our original projections with some increased pressure expected from both from personnel and maintenance costs. The strong labor market, a robust development environment. And the continued supply chain issues are expected to continue to pressure our maintenance service salaries and materials costs. We increased our guidance for total operating expenses for this by 50 basis points at the midpoint to 6%, reflecting the continued pressure. However, it's worth to note, this increase is more than offset by the revenue growth trends, which produced a revised same-store NOI expectation of 13.5% for the full year, which is  above our prior guidance. The forecast for our largest property operating expense line on the real estate taxes remains at 4% to 5%. I'll add also as a result of the continued labor market inflation assumed higher performance-based incentives, given the strong projected performance, we have also raised the midpoint of our total overhead assumptions for the full year. And the only other change to our guidance was an increase in the dollar value of our disposition volume, which was increased $25 million to a midpoint of $350 million, reflecting higher pricing expectations on assets being sold. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions. This is Al, and I can try to address that, and maybe Tim and Tom can look at it some more. But I think it comes down basically to the fact that it takes our average leases a year. And so if you look at the trends in our pricing over the last several quarters, go back to 2021 and started the year lending pricing at 2.7% and went to 8%, 8% to 15%, 16% in the third and fourth quarter, and then we put another 16.8% up in the first quarter this year. So I think what we're -- though we expect our blended pricing to be impacted by the trends this year, both prior year comps and the seasonal trends we talked about, that strength that we put in for the last several quarters is going to play out for another few quarters. And so I think if you think about our leases in the average year, that math will play out. So I think there's -- what we would expect is that revenue, given the leasing that we've done in the last several quarters will continue to accelerate. It should continue to generate in the next quarter to be pretty strong over the remainder of the year given those mid-single-digit new pricing and blended pricing performance that we expect to put in the back half of the year. So that's how it works out, basically, you got to take in the context of your lease and how that's building up and then winding down over time. Now we have to see what happens, Nick. Obviously, what we've projected as a strong second quarter continuing because we started off and so we started off, Tom talked about that's coming in, in the third quarter a good bit just because that's where the really -- if you go back to last year, that's when pricing really accelerated when we took off. So as the prior year comp at the quarter, you feel it. And then the fourth quarter has a little bit of prior year comp plus that season, so it's a little bit lower. So it's both of those, the average together is going to be in that mid-single-digit range for the second half. John, it's a great question. I think -- and of course, the markets are a bit volatile right now, both rates as well as spreads have gone up now because of some of the concerns about all the factors. But I think we certainly feel good about that deposit. I don't think we need to do anything else in terms of our balance sheet to make that happen. I think what we said is our long-term debt-to-EBITDA range is probably 4.5% to 5%, and we're below that now. I would say we have capacity for growth for some of the things that Brad is talking about. And so I think that we don't really need to do anything to let some time play out. I think there may be our boot would be there a little bit behind on catching up with the strength of the business, but we feel very good about where they are today. So we'll see what happens over the next few quarters. But hopefully, something happens there. We've already -- if you think about it, you should get about a 25 to 30 basis points impact on your borrowing costs say on average, a 10-year financing over time from going from a B to A rating. On our deals that we've done over the last couple of years, quite frankly, we've captured about half of that, John. I think we priced through a BBB+ rating and kind of move into -- almost touched A- at times and we got close. So we've captured about half, but I think we probably pick up another 15 basis points from here in a normal, stable market. The good thing is work that Andrew and the team has done, we really don't have much financing to do in this year. We only have $125 million coming due. So we'll be in the market very -- I don't plan to be in the market, as we talked about. But if we are and the rate income, we expect another 15 basis points increase what we would have been able to do. We talked about in the past, Haendel, that we talk about 4% and 5% of our balance sheet kind of being the tolerance limit. We're well below that now. So we could go -- that's $1 billion to being 4 would be no problem for us given the surface line. Certainly, we're thinking about the marketplace and how things shape up. But our balance sheet is -- our leverage is very low as we talked about how we look at it. We're below our sort of our leverage thresholds right now with plenty of capacity. And so we have only a runway to continue funding in a market that's changing. So that's how we think about it."

            "name": "TomGrimes",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust, and we're off to a good start in 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the first quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16.8% as a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis and 2.6% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.9%. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. At quarter end, we have completed 1,098 interior unit upgrades and installed 11,018 Smart Home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 Smart Home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 71,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first of 8 properties in the program that are now complete, results have exceeded our expectations of another 8 projects that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continues into April. Lease-over-lease pricing on new rent leases for April is currently at 16.5% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in April is running 16.7% ahead of the prior lease. And as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up 16.6% thus far in April. Average daily occupancy for the month of April is currently strong at 95.7%. And exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 8.5%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations and support our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth headed into the busy summer season. Our teams are well prepared and looking forward to the busier summer season. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all of our stakeholders. Al? Neil, this is Tom. Just to give you the broad trend for first quarter start and '19, move-outs from outside the footprint were 9.1%; in '20, they were 10.1%; in '21, they were 12%; and this quarter, they were 14%. So accelerating across the board. And then we see places like Phoenix are now 22%, Tampa 18%; Nashville, 29%; 15% Charleston. And yes, we see -- so those trends are continuing and they're coming in at higher salaries as well. Sure, Brad. April is, I think I mentioned, is currently running 16.7%. May in the 17% range, and June in 16% right now. But June's a little early for full understanding. So they continue to be very robust. Yes. I'll tackle kind of the first part of that. And I wouldn't see anything that I would characterize as a slowdown. It is very steady. We're few weeks into April or wrapping up April at mid-16s. And I'll tell you, we've certainly gotten some pushback on renewal increases. But those folks that are leaving for price, we're replacing with someone paying 27% higher. So what we see on this is good accept rates for renewals, both in terms of the number of people that are renewing and the increase. We are seeing closure below and occupancy continues to run in a level that we're very comfortable running in our demand metrics on leads per exposed units are as high as they've been. So short term, we feel pretty darn good about where pricing is. Just to -- yes. And so I think important to recognize we're backfilling, if you will, with someone paying 27% high and total turnover is down 6%. So we're not increasing turnover at this point, and we're repricing at a high rate on those folks that did choose to leave for price. I'd say it's a nonissue. It's one of many factors going on. And I think when you stack up sort of the different regions of the company or even the different of the country or even our submarkets, we're seeing steady performance in pricing, whether it's inner loop downtown walkable asset or a suburban asset with a drop. So just not seeing much on that on the renter side of things. Haendel, D.C. is now 10.5% on blended rent for April. And Houston is 9.6%. So if we were 3 years ago, I would be telling you how well they were doing, but those are improving. They've improved over time. They probably moved from the mid 4s. It's just that, that still puts them at the lower end of our portfolio's growth rate. So they're improving modestly, I would say. No. I mean there's just no threat at all. In fact, our in-house is, I mean, down 117 move-outs and is now just 3.2% of our reason for move-out. So it's a total nonfactor. And home buying, as you would expect, is down close to 23%. It's now just 18% of our move-out. So the affordability in those areas seems to be driving people to stay, and that's a big part of our production in turnover. Yes. And to be clear, move-out to rent increase is now down to 3.2% of our move-outs is at 100 basis points lower. So nonfactor there. And then affect how we price on renewals and our average length of stay has stayed consistent at about 20 months. So we're not seeing a real material change on that point. And we're so consistent with our renewal increases that the renewal people that have renewed, they're not generally that behind, it's more the new move-ins that are getting that higher increase. I mean, no, it is not. And that is -- those run from $100 and $150 a month, and they run more in the 3% to 4% range. No, not materially. And fees are actually up a little bit as we've gotten back to more normalized operating conditions on things like late fees and term fees. On the interior innovated, it's primarily a contractor base that's coming in and doing the countertops and cabinetry and flooring in those items. We do a little bit of the paying in-house, but it's primarily a contract process and always has been. It's not an impediment at all, much like Brad has outlined in his comments about construction, we've seen some rate increase there, but the price opportunity that we're seeing from the markets is better. And then, of course, new supplies come into our markets, and that's given us additional opportunity to grow it to a higher price point. So there's -- I would say there's some expense there, but it's not affecting the economics or saw in us down. Yes. Rich, we do. And move-outs, who moved outside the Sunbelt area were just 4.3%, but less the area, and that's down from 4.5% last year. And it's not big enough that I've spent much time trying to figure out where they're going. So -- and that is pretty big in our favor. Sure, Tayo, and I'll take the first part and kick it over to Tim to cover the margin expansion. But we've -- currently, what has either occurred or is in process as we expanded our call center solution. We've implemented lead nurturing software, which is automated prospecting engagement technology that interacts with our prospects earlier. It allows us to automate follow-ups. We've upgraded virtual touring. We've added a prospect-centric CRM. We've added mobile maintenance and mobile inspections. These changes just so far have allowed us to restructure 30 physicians in the office staff in 2021 that's benefiting us in '22. We're also getting better clarity on billing and higher resident satisfaction as a result of the inspection process. And then underway right now is improved self-touring, improved multi-location sales support, simplified online leasing, and we expect another 30 to 50 headcount reduction in '22, that will benefit '23. And then Tim can talk about -- a little bit about the margin expansion."

            "content": "Chan, this is Rob. I'll start and then maybe turn it over to Tim and Al. But so across our markets, 13 of our states that represent about 90% of our NOI actually have in place state laws that prohibit rent control at a local level. So with that starting as a backdrop to it, it's very difficult to get rent control imposed across our portfolio. So we have a group that is active in monitoring these along with the various apartment associations and trade industries that we're part of. So don't really anticipate any significant impact from rent control across any of our markets."

            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Yes, Brad, this is Tim. If you look at our entire portfolio right now, rent income is about 23% that captures everybody that's in a unit right now. So it's gone up a little bit over the last couple of years, but still remaining fairly low and feel like there's still plenty of room to move in terms of our rent performance. Yes, Austin, this is Tim. I'll hit the loss to lease part. So if you look at the blended rents for, call it, March compared to our March ERU, it would imply about 8% loss to lease. You got about $1,600 was our effective rents in March versus ERU of 14.84%. If you look at just the new lease prices where our absolute new lease prices are still running a little bit higher than renewals, it's actually about 10% based on that number. I think renewals is kind of what's -- is where some of the opportunity is right now. I mean we're still in a situation where our new lease pricing is, call it, 2% or so. The absolute pricing is 2% or so higher than the absolute pricing we're getting on renewal. So that's kind of where we -- if you want to call it, return to seasonality, return to normalcies, those renewals catching up and then likely surpassing the new leases. So I do think the renewals will continue to be strong for quite a while. I would say so. I might add one point to that, that even with the rate increases we've been seeing, our new lease rates are up about 30% over the last 2 years. But single-family home prices in our markets is up almost 40% over that same period. So relative affordability has actually got lower for single-family than it was a couple of years ago. Rob, this is Tim. I'll answer that certainly in terms of the guidance that we have for the rest of the year. The way we kind of look at it is that the blend of lease and release that we expect to get from the full year, roughly half of that should pretty much carry into the next year. So I think I guess a little more than that, I would call it somewhere around 5% now based on our guidance if pricing holds up better than we think, and certainly, that will impact that number as well. So every day that goes by, it helps us in '22, but also sets us up for '23 as well. Yes. So regarding the margin, at least for 2022, we're expecting our total margin to go up somewhere between 150 and 175 basis points. Obviously, a lot of different factors playing into that, but a lot of the components, Tom mentioned, are included there. And so smart homes, one, for sure, the installations we're doing there that we can see on the top line. That's probably contributing 40 basis points or so this year to the margin. And then some of the efficiencies on the headcount side, the call center, the automated chat are contributing a piece of that as well. I think some of the foundational things we're doing now with the CRM that's currently getting rolled out and some of the other things that Tom mentioned will have more of an impact as we get into '23, and we'll define that more definitively as we move out to the next few months."

Members of the management team participating on the call this morning with prepared comments are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo and Clay Holder. Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, and Joe Fracchia are also participating and available for questions as well.  Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplements are currently available on the -- for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. Core FFO results for the fourth quarter were ahead of our expectations. Higher non-same-store NOI performance and lower interest expense drove the outperformance. As expected during the fourth quarter, a combination of higher new supply and a seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic increasingly weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. Encouragingly, we did see some of this pressure moderate in January with blended pricing improving 130 basis points from the fourth quarter performance led by improvement in new lease pricing. Stable employment conditions, continued positive migration trends, a higher propensity of new households to rent apartments and continued low resident turnover are all combining to support steady demand for apartment housing.  We continue to believe that late this year, new lease pricing performance will improve and we will begin to capture recovery in that component of our revenue performance. In addition, with the pressure surrounding higher new supply deliveries likely to moderate later this year, we continue to believe the conditions are coming together for overall pricing recovery to begin late this year and into 2025. As you may have seen last week, MAA crossed a significant milestone marking the 30-year anniversary since our IPO. Over the past 30 years, MAA has delivered an annual compounded investment return to shareholders of 12.6%, with about half of that return comprised of the cash dividends paid. Through numerous new supply cycles and various stresses associated with the broader economy, MAA has never suspended or reduced our quarterly dividend over the past 30 years, which, of course, is a key component of delivering superior long-term as returns to REIT shareholders. Today, I'm more positive about our outlook than I was this time last year. Today, as compared to a year ago, we have more clarity about the outlook for interest rates with downward movement likely later in the year. More REITs associated with material economic slowdown or recession are dissipating. Inflation pressures on operating expenses are declining. The demand for apartment housing and absorption remained steady. And with clearly declining permits and new construction start, we have increasing visibility that competing new supply is poised to moderate. With a 30-year track record of focus on high growth markets, successfully working through several economic cycles, an experienced team and proven operating platform, a strong balance sheet and long-term shareholder performance among the top tier of all REITs, we're confident about our ability to execute on the growing opportunities in the coming year and beyond. Before turning the call over to Brad, I do want to take a moment to say a big thank you to Al Campbell, who will be officially retiring effective March 31st. Al has been with our team for the past 26 years and has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. Al has been instrumental in the growth of our company, transitioning us to the investment grade debt capital markets and has built a strong finance, accounting, tax internal audit platform for MAA. Al leads our company and finance operation in strong hands with Clay and his team. Overall, grateful for Al's service and tremendous accomplishments. So thank you, Al, for all you've done for MAA. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad. \nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned in our earnings release, we successfully closed on 2 compelling acquisitions during the fourth quarter at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. Both properties fit the profile of the type of properties we expect to continue to emerge throughout 2024. Properties in their initial lease up, with sellers focused on certainty of execution with the need to transact prior to a definitive deadline. Our relationships with the sellers and our ability to move quickly and execute on the transactions utilizing the available capacity on our line of credit without a financing contingency were key components of MAA being chosen as the buyer for these properties. MAA Central Avenue a 323-unit mid-rise property in the Midtown area of Phoenix and MAA Optimist Park a 352-unit mid-rise property in the Optimist Park area of Charlotte are expected to deliver initial stabilized NOI yields of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively. We expect both properties to achieve further yield and margin expansion as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management, marketing and lead generation practices as well as our technology platform. Additionally, we expect to achieve operational synergies by combining certain functions with other area MAA properties as part of our new property potting initiative. Due to continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains tepid, down 50% year-over-year and 16% from the third quarter space. We continue to believe that transaction volumes will pick up later in 2024, providing visibility into cap rates and market values. For deals we tracked in the fourth quarter, we saw cap rates move up by roughly 35 basis points from third quarter.  Our transaction team is very active in evaluating additional acquisition opportunities across our footprint with our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of more compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year. Our forecast for the year includes $400 million of new acquisitions, likely in lease up and therefore, dilutive until stabilization is reached.  Despite pressure from elevated new supply, our two stabilized new developments as well as our development projects currently leasing continue to deliver good performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted in our original pro-formas, creating additional long-term value. New lease rates are facing more pressure at the moment, but these properties have captured asking rents on average approximately 20% above our original expectations. Our four developments that are currently leasing are estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to permitting and approval delays, as well as an expectation that construction costs are likely to come down. We have pushed the three projects that we plan to start in 2023 into 2024. We now expect to start between 3 to 4 projects this year, with 2 starts in the first half of the year and 2 starts late in the year. Encouragingly, we have seen some recent success in getting our construction costs down on new projects that we're currently repricing.  As we have seen a meaningful decline in construction starts in our region, we're hopeful to see continued decline in construction costs as we progress through the year. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined. Any project we start this year, we'll deliver first units in 2026, aligning with the likely stronger leasing environment supported by significantly lower supply. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this constrained liquidity environment, it's possible we could add additional development opportunities to our future pipeline. The team has our portfolio in good position. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets outperforming. As we ramp up activities in 2024, we're excited about the coming year. Beyond the new external growth opportunities just covered and as Tim will outline further, we continue to see solid demand and steady absorption of the new supply delivering across our markets and remain convinced that pricing trends will begin to improve late this year and into 2025. In addition, we continue to make progress on several new initiatives aimed at further enhancing our leasing platform to further position us to outperform local market leasing metrics during the supply cycle. Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for coming to work every day, focused on improving our business, serving our residents and exceeding the expectations of those that depend on us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was right in line with our expectations with slightly lower operating expenses offsetting slightly lower blended lease over lease pricing growth. Expanding on Eric's earlier comment on new lease pricing, developers looking to gain occupancy ahead of the holiday season and the end of the year did put further pressure on new lease pricing, particularly in November and December.  However, because traffic tends to decline in the fourth quarter, again, particularly in November and December, we intentionally repriced only 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter and only about 9% in November and December. This resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of minus 1.6% for the quarter comprised of new lease rates declining 7% and renewal rates increasing 4.8%. Average physical occupancy was 95.5% and collections remained strong, with delinquency representing less than 0.5% of bill grants. These key components drove the resulting revenue growth of 2.1%.  From a market perspective in the fourth quarter many of our mid-tier metros performed well. Being invested in a broad number of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is a key part of our strategy to capture growth throughout the cycle.  Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are examples of markets that led the portfolio and lease-over-lease pricing performance. The Washington, D.C. metro area, Houston and to a lesser extent, Dallas/Fort Worth for larger metros that held up well. Austin and Jacksonville are 2 markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the level of supply being delivered into those markets. Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we completed nearly 1,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our full year total to just under 6,900 units. We completed over 21,000 smart home upgrades in 2023 and now have over 93,000 units with this technology and we expect to complete the remaining few properties in 2024. For our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that are in the repricing phase with expected yields in the 8% range. We have targeted an additional 6 projects began in 2024, with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025. Now looking forward to 2024, we're encouraged by the relative pricing trends we are seeing thus far. As noted by Eric, blended pricing in January, it was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.2%, an 80 basis point improvement for the fourth quarter and notably a 150 basis point improvement from December and renewal pricing of 5.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, while maintaining stable occupancy of 95.4%. Similarly, renewal increases achieved thus far in February and March average around 5%.  As noted, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in the second quarter of 2022.  Based on typical delivery time lines, this suggests peak deliveries likely in the middle of this year with some positive impact of pricing power soon thereafter. While increasing supply is impactful, strength of demand is more indicative of the pricing power in a particular market. Job growth is expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but growth is still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt markets. Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerates the key demand factor of household formation. Separately, the cost gap between owning and renting gapped out considerably in the back half of 2023, even before considering the impact of higher mortgage rates. Move out to buy a home dropped 20% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect a continued low number of move-outs due to home buying to contribute to low turnover overall in 2024. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay.\nClay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.32 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance and contributed core FFO for the full year of $9.17 per share, representing an approximate 8% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily driven by favorable interest and the performance of our recent acquisitions and lease-up during the quarter.  Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly below our expectations for the quarter as effective rent growth was impacted by lower lease pricing that Tim mentioned. Same-store operating expenses were slightly favorable to our fourth quarter guidance primarily from lower-than-expected personnel costs and property taxes.  During the quarter, we invested a total of $20.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart brand installation programs, producing solid returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded $48 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $256 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years.  As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start to 3 to 4 projects over the course of 2024, which would keep our development pipeline at a level consistent with where we ended 2023, in which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the year with nearly $792 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains low with debt to EBITDA at 3.6x. And at year-end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average of 6.8 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. Shortly after year-end, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.  Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2024 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.68 to $9.08 or $8.88 at the midpoint. The projected 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.9% results from rental pricing earned in of 0.5% combined with blended rental pricing expectation of 1% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing as to be comprised of lower new lease processing impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. Effective rent growth for the year is projected to be approximately 0.9% at the midpoint of our range. We expect occupancy to average between 95.4% and 96% for the year and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow in line with effective rent.  Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 4.85% for the year, with real estate taxes and insurance producing most of the growth pressure. Combined, these 2 items are expected to grow almost 6% for 2024 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow just over 4%. These expense projections combined with the revenue growth of 0.9% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.3% at the midpoint. We have a recently completed development community in lease-up, along with an additional 3 development communities actively leasing. As these 4 communities are not fully leased up and stabilized and given the interest carry associated with these projects, we anticipate our development pipeline being diluted to core FFO by about $0.05 in 2024 and turning accretive to core FFO on later stabilization. We are expecting continued external growth in 2024, both through acquisitions and development opportunities. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $100 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2024 and then again, turning to accretive to core FFO after stabilizing. We project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $132.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.9% increase over 2023 results. We expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in June 2024. These bonds currently have a rate of 4% and we forecast to refinance north of 5%. This expected refinance, coupled with the recently completed refinancing activities mentioned previously, results of $0.04 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments.  So Carrie, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : I appreciate all the color you provided on guidance. My first question would just be on the same-store revenue growth outlook. Can you provide us any more details on what would get you to the high and low end of guidance? And I guess, I'm really curious about what you would assume for the blended rate growth at the higher low end.\nTim Argo: This is Tim. So I think as far as the high end of the low end, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the renewal rates and they've been steady for the last few months. What we're seeing, as I noted, the next few months as being in that 5% range. I think that the new lease rates are what could certainly determine whether we get more to the high and low end, which is going to be a function of the demand side. We expect to see steady job growth, steady demand and migration, all those factors. So that's a little bit better. I think it obviously pushes new lease rates higher and then the opposite is true. But if you think about our full year guide, it's built on new lease rates for the year, and this will be seasonal, starting a little bit lower in Q1, accelerating to Q2 and Q3 and then declining a little late Q4, but somewhere in the negative 3%, 3.25% range on new lease for the year and expectations of the 4.5% to 5% range on renewals, which blends out to the 1% blended is what we're assuming for the full year.\nJoshua Dennerlein : I appreciate that. And then there's a drag that you're assuming on the $400 million of acquisitions, is there a way to quantify that?\nClay Holder: Yes, I think you can think -- Josh, you think through what we're projecting new rates to come in in this next year, and kind of the timing of those acquisitions from the standpoint of just the timing of it, we're assuming that those start in second quarter and then play out over the remainder of the year and we think about it maybe in the range, call it, 4 acquisitions at roughly $100 million each. And I think they'll look similar to what these other 2 acquisitions that we just completed in 2023 as far as how they will lease up and how they'll -- the drag that we'll see on earnings over 2024.\nBrad Hill : Josh, this is Brad. Just to add to that. Our assumption on the acquisitions is that obviously, as Clay mentioned, they're very similar to the ones we purchased last year. They're in lease-up. We're assuming about a 4.5% NOI yield contribution at the time of closing, given that those are in lease up and given the comments that Clay made about where our current commercial paper is and where our cost of debt is you can kind of do the math on what the dilution there is.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Eric, you remain confident that new lease pricing is going to improve this year, but it really sounds like peak deliveries don't hit until around midyear. And we've really yet to see, I guess, leasing volume pick up, so with kind of that expectation of the improvement in new lease rates for the year, do you think that lease rates get better in the back half of this year versus last year on sort of a lease weighted basis? I know things deteriorate late in the year, but more interested in sort of that period of July through October.\nEric Bolton : Well, I'll answer your question, and Tim you can jump in here. But probably speaking, yes, we do think that as you get into the summer leasing season, we've always traditionally seen leasing traffic pick up. And as commented in our prepared comments, I mean, we just see no evidence of demand really deteriorating. And we do think that normal seasonal patterns will continue to play out. So as we think about supply delivery, and we see it is pretty elevated at this point. And I mean does it go up another 10%? I don't think so. I think that kind of we're in the sort of the peak of the storm from a supply perspective. I feel like right now and a weak demand quarter. And we think that supply now stays high, certainly in Q1 and Q2 and probably even early Q3, it's hard to peg it by month, but we do think that there is a lot of reasons to believe that supply starts to peter out or starts to moderate a little bit as you get into -- particularly into Q4. So we do think that the pressure surrounding supply that will persist will be met with even stronger leasing traffic and demand patterns as we get into the summer as a function of a normal seasonal patterns and therefore, it does lead us to believe that new lease pricing performs better in Q2 and Q3. And as Tim alluded to, we expect -- again, it's a function of normal seasonal patterns that begins to moderate a little bit in Q4.  And the other thing that I would just point out, of course, is that we began to see early effects of supply pressure really in 2023 and particularly in the latter part of 2023, so in some ways, you could also suggest that the prior year comparisons in terms of new lease-over-lease performance starts to get a little bit easier, if you will in the back half of 2024. So collectively, that sort of leads us to the consensus of where we think things are headed. I mean, Tim, what would you add to that?\nTim Argo: Yes. I'll add on to what Eric was saying. If you go back to last year, I mean, our new lease pricing went slightly negative starting in July, and we got to progressively got more so throughout the year. So there is a comp component that plays into this as well. So I do think to answer one of your questions, Austin is that new lease pricing does look better at the end of 2024 as compared to the end of 2023 with those comps, with supply getting a little bit better. Now, I think the improvement won't be as clear to see because it is a lower demand time of the year when you get into November and December, but I think the trends will be positive and really start to play out in 2025.\nAustin Wurschmidt: When do you guys think new lease rate growth could turn positive? And then just my second question is, I'm just curious how -- what underlying assumptions in same-store revenue guidance changed the most relative to what you published in November of last year.\nTim Argo: I think likely new lease pricing probably doesn't go positive until 2025. I think it will get close to flat, probably in the middle of this year and the highest demand part of the year. But even in a normal year or a good year, we typically see new lease pricing is negative in the back part of the year. So I think likely, it's early 2025 as we see the flat pressure start to moderate more, so I think that's probably the most likely scenario for new lease pricing. As far as what changed, I mean, it was really, really to earn in, which is based on what we saw in November and December, as I mentioned in my comments, it is pricing really moderated quite a bit, particularly in November and December, which the way we calculate our earn in is just basically saying all right, all the leases that were in place at the end of December 31, if they all price the year for the rest of the year, what would our range growth be in that -- so the earnings more in the 0.5 range, a little bit lower than that range we talked about at NAREIT, but really driven by the new lease pricing in November and December and the pressure we saw from the developers and looking for occupancy and that sort of thing.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital.\nJohn Kim : I wanted to follow-up on that comment you just made on the earn in that basically half of what you expected in November. I realize the blended rates probably seen in lower than expected. But you also mentioned, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the leasing volume was very light fourth quarter is only 16% of leases overall. I'm just trying to understand that impact of the fourth quarter leases and why earn in come down so much in September month?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean it's basic on that. I mean I think the other -- the other component that played into is we did -- we saw turnover for the year down, but November and December, we had a little bit higher weighting on new lease pricing as compared to renewals. So more new leases in November and December than renewals obviously, with the new lease pricing was a bigger impact on the blended. Now we've seen that shift more so to what we think will happen throughout the course of 2024, which is we're waiting. We think turnover remained down and be weighted a little more towards renewals. So while we have seen new lease pricing improve in January, the blend had improved even more as we've seen more what we think will be the lower turnover component. So it's really just that. Like I said, we're -- that's comparing at the lowest part of it what was the main part of the year, we do expect blended to be positive in 2024. So I think that's calculating loss lease earning whatever you want to call it the end of the summer, certainly the most pessimistic time to look at it, but it was not pricing that drove it.\nJohn Kim : But when you calculate earn in, do you just take the blended lease change for your entire portfolio and just not weighted by number of transactions, such as [inaudible] basically?\nTim Argo: No. We just said when we talked about earn-in, we're just saying, okay, if our total rents were $2 billion at the end of December. And -- or if we take just December, whatever that number was for rent and applied that all the way through 2024, what is the full year growth over 2023. And so where that ends up, can affect that number here now.\nJohn Kim : Okay. My second question is on acquisition yields, which your last 2 were at 55 and 59. How do you see that move towards this year when you see more acquisition activity occur? And your recent bond rate is done at 5.1%. How does that change your view on initial yields that are acceptable to you?\nBrad Hill : John, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. Well, certainly, we were fortunate with the 2 acquisitions that we executed in the fourth quarter. And we felt like we got really good pricing on those for the reasons I mentioned really in my comments, but we haven't seen a lot of activity in that area. And so even in the first quarter here in January, we've seen a little bit of an uptick in terms of the deals coming out. We were at NMHC last week and certainly think that volume picks up a little bit as we go through the year. But we haven't seen a lot of opportunities coming that way. Now we do think as we continue to get further into the year that pressure given where interest costs are for the developers, given the supply pressures that they're likely to feel that the urgency from some of these developers to execute on transactions will continue to increase, and we're certainly hopeful that yields additional opportunities. The other thing that we are watching, frankly, is some of the larger equity sponsors and what their exposure is to other sectors, whether that's retail or office and some of them have big exposures to multifamily development and some of them have liquidity needs, which states that they execute transactions in some of the multifamily space. So we're having some discussions with folks like that. We're certainly hopeful that that will yield some opportunities. But I do think that the pricing expectations on the seller side is still a bit lower than where we think pricing needs to be pricing expectations are still low 5s. So we still need to see some movement up in cap rates from where those expectations are for the market to really pick up. So it's an area that we continue to work on. And we do think that there'll be more opportunities as we get through this year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman : Great. I appreciate all the color on rents and how you think you can inflect more positive, but I guess this is like a case study. If you think about your weakest market, your deepest supply challenged market, and what do you think the pace of rents look like in that market or the kind of the quarterly improvement? Or is it still weak into '25? I think just looking for like the worst-case scenario so we can build on the better.\nTim Argo: Well, I mean I will say when we talked about construction starts that peaked somewhere around the middle of 2022 that is pretty consistent across our markets. There are a few that were a little bit later that or few a little bit earlier than that. So it is a relatively consistent supply wave in terms of the timing Obviously, some markets are getting a lot more supply than others, which drives under overperformance. I mean Austin is the market we talked about forever that is our weakest one right now. I mean it's just getting a tonne of supply, it's very widespread throughout the market, whereas some other markets a little more targeted. So that's 1 that has probably been the worst new lease performance right now. So I mean, I think a market like that will continue to struggle through most of 2024, probably be 2025 before it starts to see a little bit of improvement. But I would say that, again, sort of the cadence of supply is relatively consistent across most of our markets.\nEric Bolton : And just to add to what Tim is saying, while the cadence of supply is fairly consistent, where you do see a lot of differences on occasion is by market, some -- the percent of new supply coming to the market -- as a percent of the existing stock will vary a bit. And then also, you see, of course, market differences in terms of demand and demand drivers. And so in a market like Austin, where it's probably 1 of our -- if not the most oversupplied market that we have or supply high relative to percent of existing stock. It also happens to be one of the strongest job growth markets that we have. And probably, as a consequence of that, we're seeing absorption rates, if you will, probably running higher in Austin than we would in a market like Dallas or some of the others that are also getting a lot of supply, but maybe not quite the level. I think Dallas obviously is getting a lot of job growth. But a market like Jacksonville, where you're not getting quite the level of job growth that you get in a market like Austin, so I think you have to be careful in trying to extrapolate 1 market to the whole portfolio in terms of performance expectations. I sit will vary quite a bit, and that's obviously why we diversify the way we do. As Tim and Brad alluded to in their comments, this is why we also have a mid-tier market component to our portfolio where we're seeing some of these mid-term markets holding up in a much more steady fashion than some of the others. So I think that the question about how quickly any given market steps through the or steps back through the supply pipeline, if you will is going to largely be a function of the demand factors that we see in those markets. And a market like Austin, we think has huge potential long term for us and steps back pretty strong, probably late this year and more likely into early '25.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. Yes. I mean the question is coming from -- I think most of you and most of your peers are thinking that by the end of the year, a lot of these markets are much better. So that's what I'm trying to figure out like what -- so maybe if you guys pick the market, like what do you think is going to be the market that has the most pain for the longest period combining both job growth projections and supply just so we can at least keep our eyes on that to see like this is the worst case.\nTim Argo: Yes. I would put Austin in that group for sure.\nBrad Hill : Yes, I'll agree with all. I mean it's just -- it's getting a lot of supply and frankly, without the level of job growth that would be worse off than it is. So getting a tonnes of jobs, but not is going to take some time to work through.\nJamie Feldman : That's helpful. And then thinking about the acquisition opportunities, I mean, you currently have very low leverage versus your peers how high would you be willing to take that leverage if you found the right opportunities? And then what do you view as your absolute buying power right now?\nTim Argo: Yes. I think just from a leverage standpoint, we would be comfortable moving it up to 4.5% to close to 5%. And of course, that would take a lot of time at this -- at the rate that we're looking at these coming through to get to that point. But we would be comfortable taking our leverage up to that point.\nJamie Feldman : Do you have a sense of total dollar amount?\nTim Argo: I think that gets to roughly $1.5 billion.\nOperator: We will take our next question from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nDan Tricarico : It\u2019s Dan Tricarico on for Nick. Brad, you talked about the improving absorption in the back half of the year. Can you comment on what you're seeing on the demand side, job growth migration that gives you this confidence? Maybe the general economic outlook embedded in the guide? Maybe said another way, what household formation or job growth scenario gets you to the low end of guidance?\nBrad Hill : Yes. Well, I'll start out Tim can certainly jump in here. But a couple of points I'll make here on the demand side is definitely the traditional demand drivers that we see, whether it's job growth, population growth, migration trends, all of those are still very, very positive and steady within our region of the country. And those will continue to be significant drivers over the long-term for us. But we also see another dynamic that's kind of at play here. And a big part of that has to do with the single-family market and really has to do with the affordability and the availability that we see there. As Tim mentioned in his opening comments, we've seen a significant decline in the move-outs to buy a home. That's down 20% year-over-year with us. And if you look at the cost of buying a home in our region of the country, it's up significantly over the last couple of years, the monthly cost of homeownership is about 50% to 60% higher than the rents are within our region of the country. So that's a significant hurdle for most people. We've also seen the construction starts in the single-family sector continue to decline. So the inventory level of available single-family continues to decline. And so, we think that's a pushing segment of demand into multifamily. And it's also pushing folks to stay longer in multifamily. We've seen the average tenure of our residents almost 2 years now. So that's got a demand component to it as well. And then we've also seen some preference shift within the demographics that are our rental demographics, honestly, and that is a preference to live alone. And so that also is extending the household formation numbers that we're seeing.  And so all of that really combines to a point that Eric made in his comments, which is that apartment rental continues to make a higher make up a higher percentage of the occupied housing. And so as we look out and see demand in our region of the country, those traditional drivers continue to be important, but there's also this other component that is really adding to the demand component that we see in our region of the country. Tim, what would you add?\nTim Argo: Yes. I'll add a couple of points there. I mean I think the job growth component and how much there is will be probably more likely the factor that determines to your original question, kind of high and low end, that sort of thing. I mean, I think we expect be in migration and all things Brad just noted to be there and that component of demand to be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years.  We've dialed in about 400,000 new jobs into our expectations for our markets for '24 that's down certainly from 2023, but still net positive and so expect job reprices in the subnet markets. And encouragingly, if you look at the national job growth numbers from January added, I think, about 350,000 new jobs in January. You compare that back to 2023, the average is about 250,000 a month. So while we do expect job growth to be down some to 2023, the early indications are that it's still holding up pretty well.\nDan Tricarico : That's great color. Follow-up on development. You have 3 or 4 development starts this year, development starts. What markets are those in? And what are underwritten stabilized yields on those? And I guess, along the same line, you talked about Austin being the weakest. You stabilized Windmill Hill in Austin in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how that asset leased up versus your expectations? And obviously, a little bit more suburban, but how do you expect that asset to perform within the Austin market this year, given it's expected to be 1 of the weaker markets?\nBrad Hill : This is Brad. A couple of comments. On the development side, yes, we do have 3 to 4 starts that we expect this year. 2 in the first half. One of those is in Charlotte. The other one is in the Phoenix Chandler submarket of Phoenix. We've got 2 other ones that we're working on. One is a Phase II in Denver. The other 1 is a Phase II in Atlanta. And in terms of the yields we're seeing there, we are pushing those at the moment to -- we're repricing all of those trying to get the construction cost down to really get to a yield, call it, mid-6s. That's really what our goal is. We have had some success on the project in Charlotte, we've been able to get between 5% and 6% reduction in the construction costs, which really helps support our ability to get that yield. So we feel really good about where we are with those developments. And then the 2 that are late in the year are Phase 2 projects. So we're hopeful that the yields there continue to increase as we get further construction costs out of those as well.  And I'm sorry, the second part of your question, Nick?\nDan Tricarico : The Windmill Hill in Austin in 4Q, how is that -- go ahead.\nBrad Hill : Yes, that asset performed extremely well for us. The average rents that we achieved on that asset were almost 24% higher than what we expected. So from a yield perspective, significantly outperformed what we expected. And part of that was you mentioned it's a suburban asset in Austin. Great execution on the property had 2 adjacent lease-ups going on at the same time as it, but we were very patient in how we leased that asset up. We didn't have to offer concessions to meet the market and really perform extremely well there. So I think given the execution on the construction side as well as the leasing side, we did not have to compete quite as much head-to-head with some of the competition that was in that market, and we've got pretty good results there.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe : So I understand your point on comps getting easier through the year, especially in the fourth quarter. But if the largest amount of supply is delivering in the middle of this year, it takes like a year to lease up. I guess why your brands start recovering sort of later this year before the developments are fully leased? Isn't there typically like a compounding effect of the supply?\nTim Argo: Well, I think one is the -- while we're talking about comp later starts peaked in the middle of 2022, it has been pretty steady. So I think we've seen a relatively steady level of supply being delivered over the last several quarters. And then we have the steady level of demand as well. I mean we have seen absorption keep up pretty well, even though supply compounded, as you said, certainly certain markets are a little bit different. But the other thing is middle of the year obviously is the strongest demand component. And so I think the timing of that with the timing of most of our traffic and most of the demand coming in is what we believe keep it from -- we talked about we think new lease pricing has kind of bottomed helps keep it from getting worse than where it is now, just sort of that normal seasonality and all the different demand factors that we've talked about.  And then you'll have a few months after the middle after its peak where there's still pressure, but we typically see it start to drop a few months after the final deliveries, which what gives us some confidence in the back half of the year that we start to see some improvement.\nEric Bolton : And as Tim mentioned, I mean, we also -- I mean, we assume that new lease pricing moderates in the fourth quarter, and that's also what's important to remember, that's also why we stagger our lease expirations the way we do such that we're repricing a smaller percent of leases of the portfolio in that holiday period of November and December.  So I understand the point that you're making, but we feel like that we've accounted for that both in terms of our new lease-over-lease pricing performance expectations, seasonal patterns, if you will, but also just the way we manage lease expirations over the course of the year. So we think that we've got it dialed in appropriately. And we do think that as we get into again, it varies by market so much. So it's hard to make any real conclusive broad observations as it relates to the point that you're making. But we do think that there are certain markets for sure that we begin to see the supply pressures meaningfully moderate in terms of new coming in late in the year, and that begins to establish some early signs of recovery in that new lease pricing performance as we head into 2025.\nTim Argo: I think one more point I'll add just back to the kind of the middle of the year. I mean, we're still dialing in somewhere in the negative 2.5% range during that strongest period of 2024 for new lease pricing. So we certainly don't see getting positives yet. But I think with the demand components that it will be a little bit better than what we're seeing right now.\nEric Wolfe : And then just maybe a quick clarification on the earn in. Does that include your sort of loss or gain to lease a real-time changes in market rents? Or is it based purely off the leases signed up at one point in time? Just trying to understand if like real-time movings and market rents ends up impacting that earnings such that it's always going to end up being low end at the year-end.\nTim Argo: Yes. Well, for the earning like I said, it's basically just saying all the leases that were in place at the end of 2023, so call it all the December leases just held steady for all '24 that's earned in. I mean, loss to lease, how we think about that, if you look at all of the leases that went effective in January compared to our in place, it's about a negative 1% loss lease looking at it that way. But we are dialing it in as we said, positive 1% blended for the course of 2022.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRichard Anderson: So what do you make of this January effect that's happening? Like you guys have seen this sort of recovery in January. Some of your peers, many of your peers have seen the same thing. It's still freak and cold outside. Why do you think January is recovering the way it is for you and others at this point?\nEric Bolton : Two reasons. One, you don't have the holidays in January. I think nobody likes to move during Christmas and or thanksgiving. I think holiday effect is real. And I think it weighs on people's interest in moving.  Secondly, I think that there are -- and we have seen some evidence to suggest that some developers were facing kind of a calendar year-end pressure point. And I think that we -- as we started to see in the early part of the fourth quarter as we were approaching year-end, developer lease-up practices were getting increasingly aggressive, as we're headed towards the holidays. And I think a calendar year-end and so I just think that developer practices got a little bit more aggressive in the holidays and approaching the year-end. I think that to some degree, there was some moderation on that and certainly, absent the holidays, even though it is cold and so forth. I think people's capacity to deal with the hassle of moving just improves a little bit better once you get past the holidays and therefore, traffic picked up.\nRichard Anderson: Do you think this holiday factor moderates in February, and it's still sort of a seasonally slow period of time through the January pickup and then you kind of get back to normal course sequential business. Is that fair?\nTim Argo: Yes, I think that's a good reason.\nRichard Anderson: And then second question is someone asked about how much you'd lever up and I appreciate that color. And I know you're sort of waiting for transaction market to be sort of more attractive to you to execute with still low cap rates. But you have sort of development opportunity sitting, I don't remember what the number was, but you got a lot that you can do right now. Why wouldn't you, if you're going to deliver into 2026, which is likely to be a very good year to deliver, why not really accelerate development right now and have that be a part of the -- a bigger part of the external growth story. You seem to be slowing it down more than speeding it up at this point. So, just curious on that.\nBrad Hill : Rich, this is Brad. Well, you're right, we do have a pretty big pipeline of projects that are ready that we could execute on. And really, it's just a matter of working the costs on those projects right now. I mean, as I mentioned, we are seeing early signs of coming down. On the project in Charlotte, call it, 5% to 6%. We do think we'll continue to see costs come down as we get later into this year. So while we do expect to start 3 or 4 projects this year, we have another 4 to 5 that are approved, were plans are nearly ready. And if costs came in, we could certainly pull the trigger on those. So we have the optionality to be able to do that. But we think it's prudent to be sure that the costs are in line. We do also agree with you that these line up very, very well from a delivery perspective into 2026. The other area where we are seeing opportunity that I think could yield itself more immediately, is in our prepurchase area. So we are talking with developers on a number of opportunities where projects are approved, entitled, plans are complete and in some instances, GMPs are already in place. But given some of the other liquidity constraints out there that I was talking about earlier, and pressures in other sectors, the equity or even the debt has pulled out of the project. So we are evaluating projects in that way. And so if we can find well-located opportunities with good partners that meet our return requirements, we'll definitely lean into that area a little bit more.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb : So two questions, and apologies about the clock in the background. The first one is, can you just talk a little bit about renewals? I think you said you expect them to be sort of 5%, but new rents down 3%, so an 8% spread. Can you just walk us through why that -- that seems a rather wide spread, but in your comments, you said that's sort of consistent with historic. So maybe you could just talk about that and why existing residents would accept an 8% spread versus new residents?\nTim Argo: Yes. This is Tim, Alex. I mean, the gap is a little bit wider than historical, we look at January for example, it's about 1,100 basis point gap for the month. But if you look at last year at this time, it's about 900. And even if you look at over the last several years, really as long as we've been tracking it, Q1 runs about an 800 basis point gap. And even as you get into the spring and summer, there's typically always a gap where we see renewal pricing outperforming new lease pricing. But I mean, I think there's a few reasons for that, frankly, One, there is a real cost, but a hassle cost and a financial cost to moving. There is the customer service component. When we have someone that's lived with us and knows kind of what to expect and knows what kind of service you're going to get. If you look at our Google star ratings. We averaged 4.4 Google star rating in 2023, which is highest in the sector. 80% of our ratings were 5 star and that is a component that plays out, it may offense itself in this way with our renewal pricing. And then we just -- we do dedicate a lot of time in resources to this renewal process. But in our corporate office and on the on-site teams, there's a lot of thought -- there's a lot of factors considered a lot of -- there's a level of buying that we get from our teams that get them comfortable with the rates we're sending out at. And again, that manifests itself well. So it will narrow and as we see new lease pricing, we expect to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer, that gap will narrow. But as I made in the prepared comments, if you look at February, March and even April, we're averaging right around that 5%. So I think that can hang in there, particularly as new lease rates start to accelerate around that same time frame.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is on the supply front, it only seems like a handful of your markets have supply issues, but pressure on new rent seems to be broad brushed. And yet, Sunbelt still as good economy, good jobs, good in migration. So how do you like we understand weakness in new rents in markets that have a lot of supply? But how do we interpret rent softness sort of portfolio wide, especially in the market that aren't beset by supply? And clearly, your price point seems to be affordable for the community. So I just want to understand the non-supply markets, why there's been pressure there as well?\nTim Argo: Well, we are seeing pretty good strength. And as I've commented on some of the mid-tier markets, if you think about Greenville and Savannah and Richmond and Charleston in those markets, we are seeing pretty good relative performance. I mean the supply is -- it obviously varies by market, and we're seeing it a lot more in some of the larger markets. And I think, frankly, we're seeing it in some of higher concentration markets. If you think about Austin and Charlotte and Dallas, some of our higher concentration markets is where there's more supply, which is not surprising, there are good markets to be in the sort of good long-term demand markets, and that's not really a surprise.  So I think there's some of that concentration factor that's weighing into it, where those obviously have an outsized impact on what you see at the portfolio level overall. But if you look at 2023, for example, across all of our markets, deliveries were about 4 -- between 4% and 4.5% of inventory across the portfolio. So while it varies pretty widely by market, we did see pretty good. The store leverage is probably 3% to 3.5%. So even for some of the ones that weren't getting tonne of supply, they were still higher than average.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith : My first question is on the expense -- on expenses. Can you walk through where -- which line items you're seeing particular pressure? And how you envision expense trending through the year?\nBrad Hill : Yes. Just a couple of things around expenses that I'd point to is, one, our uncontrollable expenses are really what's driving some of that expense growth whenever you kind of break that down. Real estate taxes are projected to grow at roughly 4.8% for the year. I think you saw that in our guidance. And then you have insurance that's growing at roughly 16% -- 15%, 16% for the year. So that continues to be a bit of a headwind for us as we go into 2024 and for all the same reasons that we've seen in previous years just as the market is trying to catch up there.  Then when you get into some of our controllable expenses, really the biggest driver there is probably repair and maintenance, while the other items around expenses are pretty much right there at that overall growth rate of 4.1% or actually even slightly lower than that.\nTim Argo: And I'll add just a couple of points there on the controllable. I mean, we do expect that if you look back to 2023 that all of those controllable line items will moderate in 2024 as compared to 2023 pretty significantly, and you can see that in the guide that we have. I think marketing is the one that's a little bit variable. I may not -- we had pretty reasonable marketing costs in 2023. And certainly in the environment we're in, that's something we want to make sure we're careful about to make sure we're properly spending there. So that may be the one where you don't see a significant decrease, but I think the others will see some pretty good moderation.\nMichael Goldsmith : And my follow-up is on concessions. How have concessions and competing properties trended? And are you offering any concessions that your stabilized property?\nTim Argo: I mean the concessions for us it stabilized. It's pretty minimal, I think, across the portfolio. We're about 0.5% or so of rents and concessions. And with the way we price, there's a lot of net pricing, we don't do a tonne of concessions. We do see it more in some of the lease-ups that we're competing against. I would say in general, concessions in the market and what we're competing against with went up a little bit in Q4, probably where we saw the biggest change, some of our Carolina markets, Charlotte and Raleigh were ones and we saw concessions pick up a little bit, but still in terms of lease-up and areas of lot development the concession practices is still pretty strong kind of that 1 month to 2 months range.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.\nHaendel St. Juste : Going back to your comments on your 5% renewal rate. I guess, I'm curious if that 5% renewal pricing does hold, but market rate growth is just 1%. Are you creating a [inaudible] and how do you feel about that going into next year in line of the outlook for rental rates to recover?\nTim Argo: You cut out there a little bit but I know you said a gain lease, is that what you were saying?\nHaendel St. Juste : Yes, I was saying that if the 5% renewal rate forecast that you should does hold and market rate growth rate is just 1%. Are you creating a gain to lease? And then how would that impact your outlook for next year when you expecting market rates to recover or you rental like your portfolio to recover?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, like I said, the gap is a little wider right now, but I expect it to come in. We haven't seen any signs like say, going all the way out to April. We're still kind of in that 5% range. And obviously, depends on the mix and who's renewing his new lease. We typically -- our average stays somewhere in the 20-month range, some money leases and then they do on renewal and typically move it out. So all it is you're not renewing on top of renewing and top of renewing where that gap continues to get larger and larger. But as I said, we've always seen a gap there and a little bit wider right now, but I expect it to narrow as we get into the spring. But no concerns with where we sit here right now.\nEric Bolton : And I'll just add Handel that I mean, over time to the extent that obviously, the new lease pricing pressure we're seeing right now is obviously largely a function of supply coming into the market. If that begins to moderate late this year into 2025 in the event that we do see renewal pricing need to moderate a little bit more next year, call it, instead of 5%, we're in the 3% or 4% range. We also, though, expect new to start to show some improvement next year such that we probably continue to get the blended performance that we need and that we're after. So it's a give and take back and forth.  We've always historically seen new lease pricing in that kind of 4% to 5% range. I don't recall it ever really materially getting a lot lower than that. Maybe there was a year back years ago where it got to 3%, but generally, when that's happening and certainly, we think that will be the scenario this time. By that point, our new lease pricing has started to show some improvements such that the overall blended performance continues to hang in there pretty well.\nHaendel St. Juste : I appreciate that Eric. I guess, I'm just thinking ahead and thinking of potentially that renewal rates would need to drop next year, how much CBD unless market rate growth does improve an increase maybe into the mid to single -- upper single-digit rate growth?\nEric Bolton : Yes. \nHaendel St. Juste : One more. I appreciate the color you guys gave on the building box of same-store revenue, but could you give us some color on what you're assuming for bad debt, ancillary and for turnover?\nTim Argo: Haendel, on bad debt, I would -- the way that we're thinking about that is it will remain pretty consistent with where it's run here recently. I mean we'd probably run around that 0.5 percentage point range turnover staying low, at least for our guidance, we're staying low around that 45% range. And then what was the last one that you asked about?\nHaendel St. Juste: Fee income.\nTim Argo: Yes, the ancillary income it is growing one. We're assuming it will grow pretty much in line with our overall effective rent growth, so right around that 1% level.\nHaendel St. Juste : And then one last one. I think it was last quarter, there's a lot of chatter around A versus B rental pricing and the impact that the new supply was having on that dynamic. Curious if there's any updated perspective, anything that you've seen in this past quarter or any updated views on the performance of A versus B in your portfolio is or has changed over the last quarter or so?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean we've probably seen it gap a little bit. I mean RRBs, what you would call it these or even if you want to think about suburban versus urban, suburban is outperforming urban kind of the CBD and the interim loop. If you think about suburban, we're probably about 80 basis points better in Q4 January on a blended lease-over-lease basis from what we're seeing on the secondary.  A versus B in the way we think about our portfolio, it's about 55% A, 45% B, a little bit tighter there, probably about a 30 basis point gap with the B is doing a little bit better. Occupancy pretty consistent for both. But I would say the biggest notable thing there is certainly suburban assets are outperforming a little bit of less supply in those areas as well.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern : First, I just want to say congratulations to Al. Hope you enjoy your retirement. On your lease-ups, can you talk about how those are going in terms of pace? Obviously, you're outperforming on the [RIN] side, but I'm just curious if they're taking longer than normal just given the supply backdrop?\nBrad Hill : Yes, this is Brad. Those are pretty much in line with our expectations. Certainly, there's been a slowdown in the velocity in line with our overall portfolio kind of over the holidays and the winter months. But there's nothing material in terms of difference there versus what we expected. Our day break asset is leasing up a little bit slower and has been. But in general, all of our assets, and that's the one in Salt Lake City. But in general, all of our assets are leasing up pretty much in line with our expectations in terms of velocity, given the slowdown here over the winter season.\nBradley Heffern : Okay. Got it. And maybe I missed it, but can you give your expectation for market rent growth that's underlying the guide? Obviously, you gave the blended assumption, but just looking specifically for the market piece.\nTim Argo: Our blended as we talked about is about 1%. And we really -- we expect market rent, if you will to be pretty consistent with where it is right now.\nBradley Heffern : Sorry, consistent as in flat or consistent as in similar to the 1% number?\nTim Argo: Yes, flat. 1% is what we're expecting in terms of our blending growth.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer : Just wanted to -- I think we talked a little bit about capital allocation and potential opportunities with acquisitions or developments very similar question, and again, recognizing where the balance sheet leverage is. So I was just wondering about the opportunity or maybe the appetite for share buybacks here? Or is that something you can consider? And maybe kind of what it would take for that to be under greater consideration.\nEric Bolton : Well, I mean, as you point out, I mean, we do think that attractive acquisition opportunities are going to start merging later this year into 2025 merchant builders continues to struggle with their lease-up more likely than not below what they underwrote. And so we believe for the moment that at current pricing, the longer-term yield performance that we can pick up on acquiring these lease-up properties provides a more attractive long-term investment return, especially on an after CapEx basis as compared to investing in our existing portfolio, our earnings stream. We also see it providing a better ability to continue investing in our new tech initiatives that we think offer the opportunity for meaningful margin expansion over the entire portfolio over the next few years, creating significant amounts of value. And then as you know, I mean, there's a REIT. We've long oriented our thinking around the idea that best way for us to reward shareholders over a long period of time is through the dividend and through earnings growth. And we think that continuing to find ways to put capital to work that supports those first 2 agenda items I just mentioned in supporting our ability to continue to push dividend growth through all phases of the cycle over time is the best way to reward REIT capital. Having said all that, I mean, we obviously continue to monitor the public pricing of our existing portfolio and the company and obviously interested in continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet. I mean if we continue to see dislocation or even more dislocation in terms of public versus private pricing of the real estate. I mean we do have a buyback program in place, authorization in place. We've done it before and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again if conditions warranted it. But for right now, given the outlook and the opportunity we think we have in front of us, we think better to sort of hold on to our powder, we think the long-term value proposition is likely better with the focus that we have.\nAdam Kramer : Great. And you mentioned some of the tech investments and kind of the opportunity set there. Maybe just, I don't know, I wonder 2 there that you're very excited about and you're kind of able to share with the public?\nBrad Hill : Yes. I mean, this is Brad. You've definitely heard of these in the past, but I'd say number 1 is our continued investment in our CRM platform. And we rolled this out a couple of quarters back when we continue to update and refine that platform, which really allows better management of our prospects and our leasing process. And this is also really an enabler to a number of other things that we're working on, our centralization, our specialization, our potting. All of those things have kind of our CRM platform at the centre of those. We continue to focus on our potting of properties. We've got -- we're up to 27 potted properties today and we'll continue to look to expand that when opportunities present themselves. We're also investing right now and updating our website. We're hopeful that we'll be able to roll this out later this month. And really our goal there is to be able to drive more leasing traffic through our website, which is the most cost-effective way for us to do that. We get a large portion of our traffic now through our website, and we're looking to continue to improve that. We're also really working to optimize our mobile -- our website for mobile use, which will support our online leasing and our self-touring.  The last one that I'll mention is we're rolling out right now a property-wide WiFi on select properties this year. We're also adding this on some of our new developments. And this is really an opportunity for our residents to have really seamless Wi-Fi across our property, whether it's in the unit, common areas, amenities and really provides a better opportunity in service for our residents, and that has a really big revenue component as well that we are testing at the moment.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from the line of James Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJames Feldman : I'm sorry to extend an already long call. But you had mentioned an expectation you think rental decline. You've fix amount of exposure to floating rate debt. Can you talk about your -- what's in your guidance in terms of rates this year? And then as of the year-end, you had $500 million on the commercial paper facility. Do you expect to keep that in place all year? Do you think you pay that down? Or is that already paid down?\nAndrew Schaeffer : Yes. Jamie, we paid that down in the first week of January with the bond issuance that we completed and that effective rate on that issuance was right up just north of 5%. The place we look to the next dollar is our commercial paper program. And right now, it's at roughly 5.5%, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And as rates are expected to decrease over the back half over the year, we expect that number to maybe come down a bit.\nJames Feldman : What's your assumption in your guidance for where rates go?\nAndrew Schaeffer : Yes, we've got a dropping down 25 basis points through halfway through the year and then another 25 basis points on the very back end of the year.\nJames Feldman : Okay. So you're down 75 basis points by year-end?\nAndrew Schaeffer : Just 50. 25 at the end this year.\nJames Feldman : Okay. And then you had mentioned a $0.05 drag from developments that are not stabilized yet. Is there any variability to that? Is any of that being capitalized? There couldn't be so much of a hit to earnings?\nAndrew Schaeffer : Yes, there is some capitalization there. And when you look at our capital -- interest capitalized year-over-year, a slight increase, but pretty steady. But what really comes into play there is just the timing of the developments. In 2023, we delivered and leased up 2 developments in 2024. We're going to be delivering and leasing up 4 developments. And so you got a bit of a play there that's creating some headwind. And then in general, just the overall the rate at which we're capping that interest comes into play. You're looking at an effective rate, roughly 3.5% that we're capping and then we're borrowing at a higher rate today than what than what we've capped at previously.\nJames Feldman : Okay. So I guess like even if you have an aggressive lease up or lease up better than expectation, do you think that $0.05 is still locked in? Or there a way that could go away?\nAndrew Schaeffer : I mean it would have to be a pretty meaningful change in how that would lease up to really move the needle on that $0.05.\nJames Feldman : Okay. And then finally, just a clarification. I think you had mentioned 0.85 is your blend assumption. And then you answered the last question with 1%. I know we're splitting here, but is 0.85 still the right number or is it 1%?\nAndrew Schaeffer : Yes. So our blended number is 1%. So that's the blended pricing we've got built into our revenue guidance, but our overall effective rent growth is the 0.85%. So that 0.85% includes the earn in that we've got for from 2023 plus the 1% of the blended that we're looking at for 2024.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton : All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning, and I'm sure speak to many of you over the spring. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew and good morning. Core FFO results for the fourth quarter were ahead of our expectations. Higher non-same-store NOI performance and lower interest expense drove the outperformance. As expected during the fourth quarter, a combination of higher new supply and a seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic increasingly weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. Encouragingly, we did see some of this pressure moderate in January with blended pricing improving 130 basis points from the fourth quarter performance led by improvement in new lease pricing. Stable employment conditions, continued positive migration trends, a higher propensity of new households to rent apartments and continued low resident turnover are all combining to support steady demand for apartment housing.  We continue to believe that late this year, new lease pricing performance will improve and we will begin to capture recovery in that component of our revenue performance. In addition, with the pressure surrounding higher new supply deliveries likely to moderate later this year, we continue to believe the conditions are coming together for overall pricing recovery to begin late this year and into 2025. As you may have seen last week, MAA crossed a significant milestone marking the 30-year anniversary since our IPO. Over the past 30 years, MAA has delivered an annual compounded investment return to shareholders of 12.6%, with about half of that return comprised of the cash dividends paid. Through numerous new supply cycles and various stresses associated with the broader economy, MAA has never suspended or reduced our quarterly dividend over the past 30 years, which, of course, is a key component of delivering superior long-term as returns to REIT shareholders. Today, I'm more positive about our outlook than I was this time last year. Today, as compared to a year ago, we have more clarity about the outlook for interest rates with downward movement likely later in the year. More REITs associated with material economic slowdown or recession are dissipating. Inflation pressures on operating expenses are declining. The demand for apartment housing and absorption remained steady. And with clearly declining permits and new construction start, we have increasing visibility that competing new supply is poised to moderate. With a 30-year track record of focus on high growth markets, successfully working through several economic cycles, an experienced team and proven operating platform, a strong balance sheet and long-term shareholder performance among the top tier of all REITs, we're confident about our ability to execute on the growing opportunities in the coming year and beyond. Before turning the call over to Brad, I do want to take a moment to say a big thank you to Al Campbell, who will be officially retiring effective March 31st. Al has been with our team for the past 26 years and has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. Al has been instrumental in the growth of our company, transitioning us to the investment grade debt capital markets and has built a strong finance, accounting, tax internal audit platform for MAA. Al leads our company and finance operation in strong hands with Clay and his team. Overall, grateful for Al's service and tremendous accomplishments. So thank you, Al, for all you've done for MAA. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad. Well, I'll answer your question, and Tim you can jump in here. But probably speaking, yes, we do think that as you get into the summer leasing season, we've always traditionally seen leasing traffic pick up. And as commented in our prepared comments, I mean, we just see no evidence of demand really deteriorating. And we do think that normal seasonal patterns will continue to play out. So as we think about supply delivery, and we see it is pretty elevated at this point. And I mean does it go up another 10%? I don't think so. I think that kind of we're in the sort of the peak of the storm from a supply perspective. I feel like right now and a weak demand quarter. And we think that supply now stays high, certainly in Q1 and Q2 and probably even early Q3, it's hard to peg it by month, but we do think that there is a lot of reasons to believe that supply starts to peter out or starts to moderate a little bit as you get into -- particularly into Q4. So we do think that the pressure surrounding supply that will persist will be met with even stronger leasing traffic and demand patterns as we get into the summer as a function of a normal seasonal patterns and therefore, it does lead us to believe that new lease pricing performs better in Q2 and Q3. And as Tim alluded to, we expect -- again, it's a function of normal seasonal patterns that begins to moderate a little bit in Q4.  And the other thing that I would just point out, of course, is that we began to see early effects of supply pressure really in 2023 and particularly in the latter part of 2023, so in some ways, you could also suggest that the prior year comparisons in terms of new lease-over-lease performance starts to get a little bit easier, if you will in the back half of 2024. So collectively, that sort of leads us to the consensus of where we think things are headed. I mean, Tim, what would you add to that? And just to add to what Tim is saying, while the cadence of supply is fairly consistent, where you do see a lot of differences on occasion is by market, some -- the percent of new supply coming to the market -- as a percent of the existing stock will vary a bit. And then also, you see, of course, market differences in terms of demand and demand drivers. And so in a market like Austin, where it's probably 1 of our -- if not the most oversupplied market that we have or supply high relative to percent of existing stock. It also happens to be one of the strongest job growth markets that we have. And probably, as a consequence of that, we're seeing absorption rates, if you will, probably running higher in Austin than we would in a market like Dallas or some of the others that are also getting a lot of supply, but maybe not quite the level. I think Dallas obviously is getting a lot of job growth. But a market like Jacksonville, where you're not getting quite the level of job growth that you get in a market like Austin, so I think you have to be careful in trying to extrapolate 1 market to the whole portfolio in terms of performance expectations. I sit will vary quite a bit, and that's obviously why we diversify the way we do. As Tim and Brad alluded to in their comments, this is why we also have a mid-tier market component to our portfolio where we're seeing some of these mid-term markets holding up in a much more steady fashion than some of the others. So I think that the question about how quickly any given market steps through the or steps back through the supply pipeline, if you will is going to largely be a function of the demand factors that we see in those markets. And a market like Austin, we think has huge potential long term for us and steps back pretty strong, probably late this year and more likely into early '25. And as Tim mentioned, I mean, we also -- I mean, we assume that new lease pricing moderates in the fourth quarter, and that's also what's important to remember, that's also why we stagger our lease expirations the way we do such that we're repricing a smaller percent of leases of the portfolio in that holiday period of November and December.  So I understand the point that you're making, but we feel like that we've accounted for that both in terms of our new lease-over-lease pricing performance expectations, seasonal patterns, if you will, but also just the way we manage lease expirations over the course of the year. So we think that we've got it dialed in appropriately. And we do think that as we get into again, it varies by market so much. So it's hard to make any real conclusive broad observations as it relates to the point that you're making. But we do think that there are certain markets for sure that we begin to see the supply pressures meaningfully moderate in terms of new coming in late in the year, and that begins to establish some early signs of recovery in that new lease pricing performance as we head into 2025. Two reasons. One, you don't have the holidays in January. I think nobody likes to move during Christmas and or thanksgiving. I think holiday effect is real. And I think it weighs on people's interest in moving.  Secondly, I think that there are -- and we have seen some evidence to suggest that some developers were facing kind of a calendar year-end pressure point. And I think that we -- as we started to see in the early part of the fourth quarter as we were approaching year-end, developer lease-up practices were getting increasingly aggressive, as we're headed towards the holidays. And I think a calendar year-end and so I just think that developer practices got a little bit more aggressive in the holidays and approaching the year-end. I think that to some degree, there was some moderation on that and certainly, absent the holidays, even though it is cold and so forth. I think people's capacity to deal with the hassle of moving just improves a little bit better once you get past the holidays and therefore, traffic picked up. And I'll just add Handel that I mean, over time to the extent that obviously, the new lease pricing pressure we're seeing right now is obviously largely a function of supply coming into the market. If that begins to moderate late this year into 2025 in the event that we do see renewal pricing need to moderate a little bit more next year, call it, instead of 5%, we're in the 3% or 4% range. We also, though, expect new to start to show some improvement next year such that we probably continue to get the blended performance that we need and that we're after. So it's a give and take back and forth.  We've always historically seen new lease pricing in that kind of 4% to 5% range. I don't recall it ever really materially getting a lot lower than that. Maybe there was a year back years ago where it got to 3%, but generally, when that's happening and certainly, we think that will be the scenario this time. By that point, our new lease pricing has started to show some improvements such that the overall blended performance continues to hang in there pretty well. Yes. Well, I mean, as you point out, I mean, we do think that attractive acquisition opportunities are going to start merging later this year into 2025 merchant builders continues to struggle with their lease-up more likely than not below what they underwrote. And so we believe for the moment that at current pricing, the longer-term yield performance that we can pick up on acquiring these lease-up properties provides a more attractive long-term investment return, especially on an after CapEx basis as compared to investing in our existing portfolio, our earnings stream. We also see it providing a better ability to continue investing in our new tech initiatives that we think offer the opportunity for meaningful margin expansion over the entire portfolio over the next few years, creating significant amounts of value.

We've done it before and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again if conditions warranted it. But for right now, given the outlook and the opportunity we think we have in front of us, we think better to sort of hold on to our powder, we think the long-term value proposition is likely better with the focus that we have. All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning, and I'm sure speak to many of you over the spring. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was right in line with our expectations with slightly lower operating expenses offsetting slightly lower blended lease over lease pricing growth. Expanding on Eric's earlier comment on new lease pricing, developers looking to gain occupancy ahead of the holiday season and the end of the year did put further pressure on new lease pricing, particularly in November and December.  However, because traffic tends to decline in the fourth quarter, again, particularly in November and December, we intentionally repriced only 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter and only about 9% in November and December. This resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of minus 1.6% for the quarter comprised of new lease rates declining 7% and renewal rates increasing 4.8%. Average physical occupancy was 95.5% and collections remained strong, with delinquency representing less than 0.5% of bill grants. These key components drove the resulting revenue growth of 2.1%.  From a market perspective in the fourth quarter many of our mid-tier metros performed well. Being invested in a broad number of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is a key part of our strategy to capture growth throughout the cycle.  Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are examples of markets that led the portfolio and lease-over-lease pricing performance. The Washington, D.C. metro area, Houston and to a lesser extent, Dallas/Fort Worth for larger metros that held up well. Austin and Jacksonville are 2 markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the level of supply being delivered into those markets. Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we completed nearly 1,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our full year total to just under 6,900 units. We completed over 21,000 smart home upgrades in 2023 and now have over 93,000 units with this technology and we expect to complete the remaining few properties in 2024. For our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that are in the repricing phase with expected yields in the 8% range. We have targeted an additional 6 projects began in 2024, with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025. Now looking forward to 2024, we're encouraged by the relative pricing trends we are seeing thus far. As noted by Eric, blended pricing in January, it was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.2%, an 80 basis point improvement for the fourth quarter and notably a 150 basis point improvement from December and renewal pricing of 5.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, while maintaining stable occupancy of 95.4%. Similarly, renewal increases achieved thus far in February and March average around 5%.  As noted, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in the second quarter of 2022.  Based on typical delivery time lines, this suggests peak deliveries likely in the middle of this year with some positive impact of pricing power soon thereafter. While increasing supply is impactful, strength of demand is more indicative of the pricing power in a particular market. Job growth is expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but growth is still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt markets. Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerates the key demand factor of household formation. Separately, the cost gap between owning and renting gapped out considerably in the back half of 2023, even before considering the impact of higher mortgage rates. Move out to buy a home dropped 20% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect a continued low number of move-outs due to home buying to contribute to low turnover overall in 2024. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay. This is Tim. So I think as far as the high end of the low end, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the renewal rates and they've been steady for the last few months. What we're seeing, as I noted, the next few months as being in that 5% range. I think that the new lease rates are what could certainly determine whether we get more to the high and low end, which is going to be a function of the demand side. We expect to see steady job growth, steady demand and migration, all those factors. So that's a little bit better. I think it obviously pushes new lease rates higher and then the opposite is true. But if you think about our full year guide, it's built on new lease rates for the year, and this will be seasonal, starting a little bit lower in Q1, accelerating to Q2 and Q3 and then declining a little late Q4, but somewhere in the negative 3%, 3.25% range on new lease for the year and expectations of the 4.5% to 5% range on renewals, which blends out to the 1% blended is what we're assuming for the full year. Yes. I'll add on to what Eric was saying. If you go back to last year, I mean, our new lease pricing went slightly negative starting in July, and we got to progressively got more so throughout the year. So there is a comp component that plays into this as well. So I do think to answer one of your questions, Austin is that new lease pricing does look better at the end of 2024 as compared to the end of 2023 with those comps, with supply getting a little bit better. Now, I think the improvement won't be as clear to see because it is a lower demand time of the year when you get into November and December, but I think the trends will be positive and really start to play out in 2025. I think likely new lease pricing probably doesn't go positive until 2025. I think it will get close to flat, probably in the middle of this year and the highest demand part of the year. But even in a normal year or a good year, we typically see new lease pricing is negative in the back part of the year. So I think likely, it's early 2025 as we see the flat pressure start to moderate more, so I think that's probably the most likely scenario for new lease pricing. As far as what changed, I mean, it was really, really to earn in, which is based on what we saw in November and December, as I mentioned in my comments, it is pricing really moderated quite a bit, particularly in November and December, which the way we calculate our earn in is just basically saying all right, all the leases that were in place at the end of December 31, if they all price the year for the rest of the year, what would our range growth be in that -- so the earnings more in the 0.5 range, a little bit lower than that range we talked about at NAREIT, but really driven by the new lease pricing in November and December and the pressure we saw from the developers and looking for occupancy and that sort of thing. Yes. I mean it's basic on that. I mean I think the other -- the other component that played into is we did -- we saw turnover for the year down, but November and December, we had a little bit higher weighting on new lease pricing as compared to renewals. So more new leases in November and December than renewals obviously, with the new lease pricing was a bigger impact on the blended. Now we've seen that shift more so to what we think will happen throughout the course of 2024, which is we're waiting. We think turnover remained down and be weighted a little more towards renewals. So while we have seen new lease pricing improve in January, the blend had improved even more as we've seen more what we think will be the lower turnover component. So it's really just that. Like I said, we're -- that's comparing at the lowest part of it what was the main part of the year, we do expect blended to be positive in 2024. So I think that's calculating loss lease earning whatever you want to call it the end of the summer, certainly the most pessimistic time to look at it, but it was not pricing that drove it. No. We just said when we talked about earn-in, we're just saying, okay, if our total rents were $2 billion at the end of December. And -- or if we take just December, whatever that number was for rent and applied that all the way through 2024, what is the full year growth over 2023. And so where that ends up, can affect that number here now. Well, I mean I will say when we talked about construction starts that peaked somewhere around the middle of 2022 that is pretty consistent across our markets. There are a few that were a little bit later that or few a little bit earlier than that. So it is a relatively consistent supply wave in terms of the timing Obviously, some markets are getting a lot more supply than others, which drives under overperformance. I mean Austin is the market we talked about forever that is our weakest one right now. I mean it's just getting a tonne of supply, it's very widespread throughout the market, whereas some other markets a little more targeted. So that's 1 that has probably been the worst new lease performance right now. So I mean, I think a market like that will continue to struggle through most of 2024, probably be 2025 before it starts to see a little bit of improvement. But I would say that, again, sort of the cadence of supply is relatively consistent across most of our markets. Yes. I would put Austin in that group for sure. Yes. I think just from a leverage standpoint, we would be comfortable moving it up to 4.5% to close to 5%. And of course, that would take a lot of time at this -- at the rate that we're looking at these coming through to get to that point. But we would be comfortable taking our leverage up to that point. I think that gets to roughly $1.5 billion. Yes. I'll add a couple of points there. I mean I think the job growth component and how much there is will be probably more likely the factor that determines to your original question, kind of high and low end, that sort of thing. I mean, I think we expect be in migration and all things Brad just noted to be there and that component of demand to be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years.  We've dialed in about 400,000 new jobs into our expectations for our markets for '24 that's down certainly from 2023, but still net positive and so expect job reprices in the subnet markets. And encouragingly, if you look at the national job growth numbers from January added, I think, about 350,000 new jobs in January. You compare that back to 2023, the average is about 250,000 a month. So while we do expect job growth to be down some to 2023, the early indications are that it's still holding up pretty well. Well, I think one is the -- while we're talking about comp later starts peaked in the middle of 2022, it has been pretty steady. So I think we've seen a relatively steady level of supply being delivered over the last several quarters. And then we have the steady level of demand as well. I mean we have seen absorption keep up pretty well, even though supply compounded, as you said, certainly certain markets are a little bit different. But the other thing is middle of the year obviously is the strongest demand component. And so I think the timing of that with the timing of most of our traffic and most of the demand coming in is what we believe keep it from -- we talked about we think new lease pricing has kind of bottomed helps keep it from getting worse than where it is now, just sort of that normal seasonality and all the different demand factors that we've talked about.  And then you'll have a few months after the middle after its peak where there's still pressure, but we typically see it start to drop a few months after the final deliveries, which what gives us some confidence in the back half of the year that we start to see some improvement. I think one more point I'll add just back to the kind of the middle of the year. I mean, we're still dialing in somewhere in the negative 2.5% range during that strongest period of 2024 for new lease pricing. So we certainly don't see getting positives yet. But I think with the demand components that it will be a little bit better than what we're seeing right now. Yes. Well, for the earning like I said, it's basically just saying all the leases that were in place at the end of 2023, so call it all the December leases just held steady for all '24 that's earned in. I mean, loss to lease, how we think about that, if you look at all of the leases that went effective in January compared to our in place, it's about a negative 1% loss lease looking at it that way. But we are dialing it in as we said, positive 1% blended for the course of 2022. Yes, I think that's a good reason. Yes. This is Tim, Alex. I mean, the gap is a little bit wider than historical, we look at January for example, it's about 1,100 basis point gap for the month. But if you look at last year at this time, it's about 900. And even if you look at over the last several years, really as long as we've been tracking it, Q1 runs about an 800 basis point gap. And even as you get into the spring and summer, there's typically always a gap where we see renewal pricing outperforming new lease pricing. But I mean, I think there's a few reasons for that, frankly, One, there is a real cost, but a hassle cost and a financial cost to moving. There is the customer service component. When we have someone that's lived with us and knows kind of what to expect and knows what kind of service you're going to get. If you look at our Google star ratings. We averaged 4.4 Google star rating in 2023, which is highest in the sector. 80% of our ratings were 5 star and that is a component that plays out, it may offense itself in this way with our renewal pricing. And then we just -- we do dedicate a lot of time in resources to this renewal process. But in our corporate office and on the on-site teams, there's a lot of thought -- there's a lot of factors considered a lot of -- there's a level of buying that we get from our teams that get them comfortable with the rates we're sending out at. And again, that manifests itself well. So it will narrow and as we see new lease pricing, we expect to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer, that gap will narrow. But as I made in the prepared comments, if you look at February, March and even April, we're averaging right around that 5%. So I think that can hang in there, particularly as new lease rates start to accelerate around that same time frame. Well, we are seeing pretty good strength. And as I've commented on some of the mid-tier markets, if you think about Greenville and Savannah and Richmond and Charleston in those markets, we are seeing pretty good relative performance. I mean the supply is -- it obviously varies by market, and we're seeing it a lot more in some of the larger markets. And I think, frankly, we're seeing it in some of higher concentration markets. If you think about Austin and Charlotte and Dallas, some of our higher concentration markets is where there's more supply, which is not surprising, there are good markets to be in the sort of good long-term demand markets, and that's not really a surprise.  So I think there's some of that concentration factor that's weighing into it, where those obviously have an outsized impact on what you see at the portfolio level overall. But if you look at 2023, for example, across all of our markets, deliveries were about 4 -- between 4% and 4.5% of inventory across the portfolio. So while it varies pretty widely by market, we did see pretty good. The store leverage is probably 3% to 3.5%. So even for some of the ones that weren't getting tonne of supply, they were still higher than average. And I'll add just a couple of points there on the controllable. I mean, we do expect that if you look back to 2023 that all of those controllable line items will moderate in 2024 as compared to 2023 pretty significantly, and you can see that in the guide that we have. I think marketing is the one that's a little bit variable. I may not -- we had pretty reasonable marketing costs in 2023. And certainly in the environment we're in, that's something we want to make sure we're careful about to make sure we're properly spending there. So that may be the one where you don't see a significant decrease, but I think the others will see some pretty good moderation. I mean the concessions for us it stabilized. It's pretty minimal, I think, across the portfolio. We're about 0.5% or so of rents and concessions. And with the way we price, there's a lot of net pricing, we don't do a tonne of concessions. We do see it more in some of the lease-ups that we're competing against. I would say in general, concessions in the market and what we're competing against with went up a little bit in Q4, probably where we saw the biggest change, some of our Carolina markets, Charlotte and Raleigh were ones and we saw concessions pick up a little bit, but still in terms of lease-up and areas of lot development the concession practices is still pretty strong kind of that 1 month to 2 months range. You cut out there a little bit but I know you said a gain lease, is that what you were saying? Yes. I mean, like I said, the gap is a little wider right now, but I expect it to come in. We haven't seen any signs like say, going all the way out to April. We're still kind of in that 5% range. And obviously, depends on the mix and who's renewing his new lease. We typically -- our average stays somewhere in the 20-month range, some money leases and then they do on renewal and typically move it out. So all it is you're not renewing on top of renewing and top of renewing where that gap continues to get larger and larger. But as I said, we've always seen a gap there and a little bit wider right now, but I expect it to narrow as we get into the spring. But no concerns with where we sit here right now. Haendel, on bad debt, I would -- the way that we're thinking about that is it will remain pretty consistent with where it's run here recently. I mean we'd probably run around that 0.5 percentage point range turnover staying low, at least for our guidance, we're staying low around that 45% range. And then what was the last one that you asked about? Yes, the ancillary income it is growing one. We're assuming it will grow pretty much in line with our overall effective rent growth, so right around that 1% level. Yes. I mean we've probably seen it gap a little bit. I mean RRBs, what you would call it these or even if you want to think about suburban versus urban, suburban is outperforming urban kind of the CBD and the interim loop. If you think about suburban, we're probably about 80 basis points better in Q4 January on a blended lease-over-lease basis from what we're seeing on the secondary.  A versus B in the way we think about our portfolio, it's about 55% A, 45% B, a little bit tighter there, probably about a 30 basis point gap with the B is doing a little bit better. Occupancy pretty consistent for both. But I would say the biggest notable thing there is certainly suburban assets are outperforming a little bit of less supply in those areas as well. Our blended as we talked about is about 1%. And we really -- we expect market rent, if you will to be pretty consistent with where it is right now. Yes, flat. 1% is what we're expecting in terms of our blending growth."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.32 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance and contributed core FFO for the full year of $9.17 per share, representing an approximate 8% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily driven by favorable interest and the performance of our recent acquisitions and lease-up during the quarter.  Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly below our expectations for the quarter as effective rent growth was impacted by lower lease pricing that Tim mentioned. Same-store operating expenses were slightly favorable to our fourth quarter guidance primarily from lower-than-expected personnel costs and property taxes.  During the quarter, we invested a total of $20.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart brand installation programs, producing solid returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded $48 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $256 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years.  As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start to 3 to 4 projects over the course of 2024, which would keep our development pipeline at a level consistent with where we ended 2023, in which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the year with nearly $792 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains low with debt to EBITDA at 3.6x. And at year-end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average of 6.8 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. Shortly after year-end, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.  Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2024 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.68 to $9.08 or $8.88 at the midpoint. The projected 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.9% results from rental pricing earned in of 0.5% combined with blended rental pricing expectation of 1% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing as to be comprised of lower new lease processing impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. Effective rent growth for the year is projected to be approximately 0.9% at the midpoint of our range. We expect occupancy to average between 95.4% and 96% for the year and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow in line with effective rent.  Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 4.85% for the year, with real estate taxes and insurance producing most of the growth pressure. Combined, these 2 items are expected to grow almost 6% for 2024 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow just over 4%. These expense projections combined with the revenue growth of 0.9% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.3% at the midpoint. We have a recently completed development community in lease-up, along with an additional 3 development communities actively leasing. As these 4 communities are not fully leased up and stabilized and given the interest carry associated with these projects, we anticipate our development pipeline being diluted to core FFO by about $0.05 in 2024 and turning accretive to core FFO on later stabilization. We are expecting continued external growth in 2024, both through acquisitions and development opportunities. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $100 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2024 and then again, turning to accretive to core FFO after stabilizing. We project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $132.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.9% increase over 2023 results. We expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in June 2024. These bonds currently have a rate of 4% and we forecast to refinance north of 5%. This expected refinance, coupled with the recently completed refinancing activities mentioned previously, results of $0.04 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments.  So Carrie, we will now turn the call back to you for questions. Yes, I think you can think -- Josh, you think through what we're projecting new rates to come in in this next year, and kind of the timing of those acquisitions from the standpoint of just the timing of it, we're assuming that those start in second quarter and then play out over the remainder of the year and we think about it maybe in the range, call it, 4 acquisitions at roughly $100 million each. And I think they'll look similar to what these other 2 acquisitions that we just completed in 2023 as far as how they will lease up and how they'll -- the drag that we'll see on earnings over 2024."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned in our earnings release, we successfully closed on 2 compelling acquisitions during the fourth quarter at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. Both properties fit the profile of the type of properties we expect to continue to emerge throughout 2024. Properties in their initial lease up, with sellers focused on certainty of execution with the need to transact prior to a definitive deadline. Our relationships with the sellers and our ability to move quickly and execute on the transactions utilizing the available capacity on our line of credit without a financing contingency were key components of MAA being chosen as the buyer for these properties. MAA Central Avenue a 323-unit mid-rise property in the Midtown area of Phoenix and MAA Optimist Park a 352-unit mid-rise property in the Optimist Park area of Charlotte are expected to deliver initial stabilized NOI yields of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively. We expect both properties to achieve further yield and margin expansion as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management, marketing and lead generation practices as well as our technology platform. Additionally, we expect to achieve operational synergies by combining certain functions with other area MAA properties as part of our new property potting initiative. Due to continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains tepid, down 50% year-over-year and 16% from the third quarter space. We continue to believe that transaction volumes will pick up later in 2024, providing visibility into cap rates and market values. For deals we tracked in the fourth quarter, we saw cap rates move up by roughly 35 basis points from third quarter.  Our transaction team is very active in evaluating additional acquisition opportunities across our footprint with our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of more compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year. Our forecast for the year includes $400 million of new acquisitions, likely in lease up and therefore, dilutive until stabilization is reached.  Despite pressure from elevated new supply, our two stabilized new developments as well as our development projects currently leasing continue to deliver good performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted in our original pro-formas, creating additional long-term value. New lease rates are facing more pressure at the moment, but these properties have captured asking rents on average approximately 20% above our original expectations. Our four developments that are currently leasing are estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to permitting and approval delays, as well as an expectation that construction costs are likely to come down. We have pushed the three projects that we plan to start in 2023 into 2024. We now expect to start between 3 to 4 projects this year, with 2 starts in the first half of the year and 2 starts late in the year. Encouragingly, we have seen some recent success in getting our construction costs down on new projects that we're currently repricing.  As we have seen a meaningful decline in construction starts in our region, we're hopeful to see continued decline in construction costs as we progress through the year. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined. Any project we start this year, we'll deliver first units in 2026, aligning with the likely stronger leasing environment supported by significantly lower supply. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this constrained liquidity environment, it's possible we could add additional development opportunities to our future pipeline. The team has our portfolio in good position. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets outperforming. As we ramp up activities in 2024, we're excited about the coming year. Beyond the new external growth opportunities just covered and as Tim will outline further, we continue to see solid demand and steady absorption of the new supply delivering across our markets and remain convinced that pricing trends will begin to improve late this year and into 2025. In addition, we continue to make progress on several new initiatives aimed at further enhancing our leasing platform to further position us to outperform local market leasing metrics during the supply cycle. Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for coming to work every day, focused on improving our business, serving our residents and exceeding the expectations of those that depend on us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim. Josh, this is Brad. Just to add to that. Our assumption on the acquisitions is that obviously, as Clay mentioned, they're very similar to the ones we purchased last year. They're in lease-up. We're assuming about a 4.5% NOI yield contribution at the time of closing, given that those are in lease up and given the comments that Clay made about where our current commercial paper is and where our cost of debt is you can kind of do the math on what the dilution there is. John, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. Well, certainly, we were fortunate with the 2 acquisitions that we executed in the fourth quarter. And we felt like we got really good pricing on those for the reasons I mentioned really in my comments, but we haven't seen a lot of activity in that area. And so even in the first quarter here in January, we've seen a little bit of an uptick in terms of the deals coming out. We were at NMHC last week and certainly think that volume picks up a little bit as we go through the year. But we haven't seen a lot of opportunities coming that way. Now we do think as we continue to get further into the year that pressure given where interest costs are for the developers, given the supply pressures that they're likely to feel that the urgency from some of these developers to execute on transactions will continue to increase, and we're certainly hopeful that yields additional opportunities. The other thing that we are watching, frankly, is some of the larger equity sponsors and what their exposure is to other sectors, whether that's retail or office and some of them have big exposures to multifamily development and some of them have liquidity needs, which states that they execute transactions in some of the multifamily space. So we're having some discussions with folks like that. We're certainly hopeful that that will yield some opportunities. But I do think that the pricing expectations on the seller side is still a bit lower than where we think pricing needs to be pricing expectations are still low 5s. So we still need to see some movement up in cap rates from where those expectations are for the market to really pick up. So it's an area that we continue to work on. And we do think that there'll be more opportunities as we get through this year. Yes, I'll agree with all. I mean it's just -- it's getting a lot of supply and frankly, without the level of job growth that would be worse off than it is. So getting a tonnes of jobs, but not is going to take some time to work through. Yes. Well, I'll start out Tim can certainly jump in here. But a couple of points I'll make here on the demand side is definitely the traditional demand drivers that we see, whether it's job growth, population growth, migration trends, all of those are still very, very positive and steady within our region of the country. And those will continue to be significant drivers over the long-term for us. But we also see another dynamic that's kind of at play here. And a big part of that has to do with the single-family market and really has to do with the affordability and the availability that we see there. As Tim mentioned in his opening comments, we've seen a significant decline in the move-outs to buy a home. That's down 20% year-over-year with us. And if you look at the cost of buying a home in our region of the country, it's up significantly over the last couple of years, the monthly cost of homeownership is about 50% to 60% higher than the rents are within our region of the country. So that's a significant hurdle for most people. We've also seen the construction starts in the single-family sector continue to decline. So the inventory level of available single-family continues to decline. And so, we think that's a pushing segment of demand into multifamily. And it's also pushing folks to stay longer in multifamily. We've seen the average tenure of our residents almost 2 years now. So that's got a demand component to it as well. And then we've also seen some preference shift within the demographics that are our rental demographics, honestly, and that is a preference to live alone. And so that also is extending the household formation numbers that we're seeing.  And so all of that really combines to a point that Eric made in his comments, which is that apartment rental continues to make a higher make up a higher percentage of the occupied housing. And so as we look out and see demand in our region of the country, those traditional drivers continue to be important, but there's also this other component that is really adding to the demand component that we see in our region of the country. Tim, what would you add? This is Brad. A couple of comments. On the development side, yes, we do have 3 to 4 starts that we expect this year. 2 in the first half. One of those is in Charlotte. The other one is in the Phoenix Chandler submarket of Phoenix. We've got 2 other ones that we're working on. One is a Phase II in Denver. The other 1 is a Phase II in Atlanta. And in terms of the yields we're seeing there, we are pushing those at the moment to -- we're repricing all of those trying to get the construction cost down to really get to a yield, call it, mid-6s. That's really what our goal is. We have had some success on the project in Charlotte, we've been able to get between 5% and 6% reduction in the construction costs, which really helps support our ability to get that yield. So we feel really good about where we are with those developments. And then the 2 that are late in the year are Phase 2 projects. So we're hopeful that the yields there continue to increase as we get further construction costs out of those as well.  And I'm sorry, the second part of your question, Nick? Yes, that asset performed extremely well for us. The average rents that we achieved on that asset were almost 24% higher than what we expected. So from a yield perspective, significantly outperformed what we expected. And part of that was you mentioned it's a suburban asset in Austin. Great execution on the property had 2 adjacent lease-ups going on at the same time as it, but we were very patient in how we leased that asset up. We didn't have to offer concessions to meet the market and really perform extremely well there. So I think given the execution on the construction side as well as the leasing side, we did not have to compete quite as much head-to-head with some of the competition that was in that market, and we've got pretty good results there. Rich, this is Brad. Well, you're right, we do have a pretty big pipeline of projects that are ready that we could execute on. And really, it's just a matter of working the costs on those projects right now. I mean, as I mentioned, we are seeing early signs of coming down. On the project in Charlotte, call it, 5% to 6%. We do think we'll continue to see costs come down as we get later into this year. So while we do expect to start 3 or 4 projects this year, we have another 4 to 5 that are approved, were plans are nearly ready. And if costs came in, we could certainly pull the trigger on those. So we have the optionality to be able to do that. But we think it's prudent to be sure that the costs are in line. We do also agree with you that these line up very, very well from a delivery perspective into 2026. The other area where we are seeing opportunity that I think could yield itself more immediately, is in our prepurchase area. So we are talking with developers on a number of opportunities where projects are approved, entitled, plans are complete and in some instances, GMPs are already in place. But given some of the other liquidity constraints out there that I was talking about earlier, and pressures in other sectors, the equity or even the debt has pulled out of the project. So we are evaluating projects in that way. And so if we can find well-located opportunities with good partners that meet our return requirements, we'll definitely lean into that area a little bit more. Yes. Just a couple of things around expenses that I'd point to is, one, our uncontrollable expenses are really what's driving some of that expense growth whenever you kind of break that down. Real estate taxes are projected to grow at roughly 4.8% for the year. I think you saw that in our guidance. And then you have insurance that's growing at roughly 16% -- 15%, 16% for the year. So that continues to be a bit of a headwind for us as we go into 2024 and for all the same reasons that we've seen in previous years just as the market is trying to catch up there.  Then when you get into some of our controllable expenses, really the biggest driver there is probably repair and maintenance, while the other items around expenses are pretty much right there at that overall growth rate of 4.1% or actually even slightly lower than that. Yes, this is Brad. Those are pretty much in line with our expectations. Certainly, there's been a slowdown in the velocity in line with our overall portfolio kind of over the holidays and the winter months. But there's nothing material in terms of difference there versus what we expected. Our day break asset is leasing up a little bit slower and has been. But in general, all of our assets, and that's the one in Salt Lake City. But in general, all of our assets are leasing up pretty much in line with our expectations in terms of velocity, given the slowdown here over the winter season. Yes. I mean, this is Brad. You've definitely heard of these in the past, but I'd say number 1 is our continued investment in our CRM platform. And we rolled this out a couple of quarters back when we continue to update and refine that platform, which really allows better management of our prospects and our leasing process. And this is also really an enabler to a number of other things that we're working on, our centralization, our specialization, our potting. All of those things have kind of our CRM platform at the centre of those. We continue to focus on our potting of properties. We've got -- we're up to 27 potted properties today and we'll continue to look to expand that when opportunities present themselves. We're also investing right now and updating our website. We're hopeful that we'll be able to roll this out later this month. And really our goal there is to be able to drive more leasing traffic through our website, which is the most cost-effective way for us to do that. We get a large portion of our traffic now through our website, and we're looking to continue to improve that. We're also really working to optimize our mobile -- our website for mobile use, which will support our online leasing and our self-touring.  The last one that I'll mention is we're rolling out right now a property-wide WiFi on select properties this year. We're also adding this on some of our new developments. And this is really an opportunity for our residents to have really seamless Wi-Fi across our property, whether it's in the unit, common areas, amenities and really provides a better opportunity in service for our residents, and that has a really big revenue component as well that we are testing at the moment."

Afterward, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today October 26th, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Adam Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Brittney and good morning everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Brad Hill, and Clay Holder. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplements are currently available on the -- for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. MAA's third quarter FFO performance was ahead of our expectations as the demand side of our business continues to capture good leasing traffic, low resident turnover, positive migration trends, and strong collections performance. During the quarter, we did see a higher impact from new supply deliveries across several of our larger markets with the resulting impact showing up in pricing associated with new move-in residents, while we continue to believe that MAA's unique market diversification a more affordable rent structure and an experienced and capable operating platform will enable us to push back against some of the supply pressure. The high volume of new deliveries in several markets will continue to weigh on rent growth associated with new resident move-ins for the next few quarters. Encouragingly, there is now clear evidence emerging that new supply deliveries are poised to meaningfully drop late next year into 2025. We have certainly worked through these supply cycles before and continue to believe that MAA's more extensive market and submarket diversification new AI and technology tools and an experienced operating team has us in a position to outperform our markets. As we have discussed previously one of the benefits that typically emerges from a heavy supply cycle particularly one that is characterized by higher interest rates is an increasing volume of acquisition and external growth opportunities. We have seen a shift take place with seller and developer pricing expectations. The more challenging lease-up conditions coupled with higher interest rates that are likely to be with us for a while are generating more buying opportunities. As Brad will recap in his comments the property acquisition we completed after quarter end is a good example of where we expect more opportunities to emerge specifically a recently completed new development that is still in initial lease-up with seller requirements to close within a short timeframe. Before turning the call over to the team to provide details surrounding our performance and market conditions, let me summarize what I believe are the four key takeaways in our report. First, demand across our markets remain solid and supportive of steady absorption of the new supply. Secondly, current high levels of new supply coupled with developer pressures related to the higher interest rate environment will cause the leasing environment to remain competitive for the next few quarters with new supply pressures expected to then decline. We expect to see an increasing number of compelling external growth opportunities in 2024. And four, MAA's long track record of performance and experience in working with markets with higher demand and supply dynamics now further supported by a stronger technology platform and a strong balance sheet with significant capacity has the company in very well position as we work through the current cycle. And with that I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. As anticipated we saw an increase in for-sale marketing activity emerge early in the third quarter. And while closed transactions are limited in number, we continue to see some upward pressure on cap rates on projects we track, with cap rates up by roughly 15 basis points from 2Q. As indicated in our earnings release, we recently closed the Phoenix market that we began pursuing early in 3Q. MAA Central Avenue is a 323-unit mid-rise property that fits the profile of the type of opportunities we expected to emerge. The property is in its initial lease-up and the seller was under some pressure to close on the sale by a specific date. So, counterparty risk considerations were paramount to the seller. Our familiarity with the market, speed of execution and balance sheet strength that supports an ability to close all cash with no financing contingencies were all aspects of our offer that were very important to the sellers. Our pricing of approximately $317,000 per unit is substantially below current replacement costs and is expected to provide an initial stabilized NOI yield of 5.5%. With the property nearing stabilization, we expect over the following year or so to capture further margin and yield expansion opportunities as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management practices and technology platform coupled with our future ability to achieve operational synergies with another MAA property that is only half a mile away. Our transaction team is very active in evaluating other acquisition opportunities across our footprint. And Al and Clay have our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of additional compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year and into 2024. Despite pressure from elevated supply our new properties in their initial lease-up continued to deliver strong performance producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties on average have captured in-place rents 15% above our original expectations. For the five properties that are either leasing or will start leasing by the end of the year this rent outperformance which is partially offset by higher expenses including taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.7% significantly higher than our original expectations. Leasing has progressed well at MA Windmill Hill in Austin and we expect this community to stabilize this quarter. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to some permitting and approval delays three projects that we plan to start this year will likely instead start in early 2024. In a number of markets -- in a number of our markets, construction costs have been slower to adjust than we expected, but we continue to see signs that a broader reduction in cost is likely to come. Numerous consultants that we work with including architects and engineers have indicated their volume of work has significantly decreased in the last few months providing further evidence of a decline in new construction activity. Additionally, general contractors are indicating they have more capacity to start new projects and in many cases with a larger pool of subcontractors available. In addition to the three projects mentioned that we expect to start over the next six months, we have five more projects representing approximately 1,320 units that could be ready for construction start by the end of 2024. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today we own or control 13 well-located sites representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects allowing us to maintain our patience and discipline when making capital deployment decisions. Any project we start in 2024 will deliver units into a stronger leasing environment with lower competitive supply in late 2025 and 2026. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this more constrained liquidity environment we are hopeful that we may find additional development opportunities to add to our future pipeline. In addition to continuously monitoring the construction market and evaluating costs at our projects in predevelopment, our construction management team is focused on completing and delivering our remaining five under construction projects. During the third quarter the team successfully wrapped up construction on novel West Midtown in Atlanta completing the delivery of all 340 units. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that I'll turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo: Thanks, Brad and good morning. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with sequentially higher occupancy offsetting sequentially declining new lease pricing. Increasing supply pressure did impact pricing in some of our markets resulting in a blended lease over lease pricing of 1.6% comprised of new lease rates declining 2.2% and renewal rates increasing 5%. Average physical occupancy was 95.7% resulting in revenue growth of 4.1%. The various metrics we measure related to demand remained strong. Employment markets remained stable with continued job growth across our Sunbelt markets. Net positive migration trends to our markets continue with move into our footprint well ahead of move-outs outside of our footprint and remain consistent with what we have seen in the last several quarters. Resident turnover was down once again in the third quarter a 4% decrease from prior year. Collections remained strong and consistent with prior quarters. Our new resident rent-to-income ratio remained low and in line with prior quarters and our lead volume is consistent with what we would expect and in line with pre-pandemic levels. But as mentioned, we did feel the impact of new supply in the third quarter which manifested itself in lower new lease pricing particularly beginning in August and September. This pressure was driven by higher concession uses by developers in many of our markets with the resulting reduction in net pricing in a number of our direct market comps. This peer pricing movement obviously does impact market pricing it impacts our asking rents. We believe the lingering higher interest rate environment with the 10-year treasury moving up quickly in the third quarter is driving merchant developers to get more aggressive on pricing and is creating some pockets of pricing pressure. Historically with typical seasonality pricing tends to moderate some in Q3 as compared to Q2 and then moderating quite a bit more from Q3 to Q4 typically in the 200 basis point range. While we did see a greater degree of moderation in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter with the solid demand factors mentioned previously we expect less moderation than normal from Q3 to Q4. October to date Blend and lease-over-lease pricing is zero which is within 10 basis points of what was achieved in September and a lower rate of decline than the more typical 60 basis points. Average physical occupancy for October month to date remains strong at 95.6% with exposure which is a combination of current vacancy and units on notice to vacate up 6.9% and in line with October of last year. In addition to the demand factors mentioned increased absorption through the third quarter in the Sunbelt markets provides further evidence of continued solid demand to help mitigate the impact of the continuing new deliveries. The amount of new supply that was absorbed in the third quarter in our markets was the highest it has been since the beginning of 2022. Despite the new supply pressure in some markets, our unique portfolio strategy to maintain a broad diversity of markets submarkets asset types and price points is serving us well with many of our mid-tier markets leading the portfolio and pricing performance both in the third quarter and into October. Savannah Charleston, Richmond Greenville and Raleigh are examples of markets outperforming larger metros with more new supply pressures such as Austin and Phoenix. We expect this market diversification combined with the continued strong demand fundamentals noted earlier will help continue to mitigate some of the impact of new supply as compared to a less diversified portfolio. Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 2,300 interior unit upgrades and are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative with over 92,000 units now with this technology. For our repositioning program we have five active projects that have either begun repricing or will begin repricing in the fourth quarter with expected yields in the 8% range. Additionally, we are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023 or early in 2024, with the target to complete by early 2025. That's all I had in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.\nClay Holder: Thank you Tim and good morning. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.29 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest and overhead costs during the quarter. Overall same-store operating performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of expectations as average occupancy was better than forecasted. The increase in occupancy was offset by the moderation of effective rent growth on new move-in leases as Tim mentioned. As expected, we began to see some moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the third quarter. However, this moderation was less than what we had forecasted. Personnel costs came in higher than expected, primarily due to higher contract labor costs and higher leasing commission, which helped drive the improvements in occupancy. The personnel costs were partially offset by real estate taxes that were favorable to our forecast for the quarter. We received more information related to the Texas state legislation that was passed in the quarter that reduced property tax rates in the state. Our projection for real estate taxes for the full year remains unchanged. During the quarter, we invested a total of $19.7 million of capital through our redevelopment repositioning and smart rent installation programs. Those investments continue to produce strong returns and add to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded just over $47 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $643 million pipeline leaving $296 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new projects over the next 12 to 18 months which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains historically low with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 3.4 times, and at quarter end our debt was 100% fixed for an average of just over seven years at a low average interest rate of 3.4%. In October, we refinanced $350 million of maturing debt utilizing cash on our balance sheet and our commercial paper program. Our current plan is to continue to be patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to stabilize before refinancing. That's all I have for my prepared comments and I'll turn it over to Al to discuss Q4 guidance.\nAl Campbell: Thank you, Clay, and good morning everyone. Given the third quarter performance outlined by Clay as well as expectations for the remainder of the year we have updated and narrowed our guidance ranges for the year which is detailed in the supplement to our release. Overall, the third quarter core FFO favorability primarily related to overhead and interest costs is expected to be essentially offset by higher-than-projected same-store operating expenses for the remainder of the year, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment. Thus, we're maintaining the midpoint of our core FFO projection for the full year of $9.14 per share which reflects a 7.5% growth over the prior year. The midpoint of our total revenue growth projection for the year remains unchanged as the expected impact of pricing moderation, which is reflected in effective rent growth is largely offset by the increase in projected average occupancy for the year. However, we have increased our guidance for same-store operating expense growth for the full year by 45 basis points to 6.5% at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the continued pressure in labor costs partially related to building higher occupancy. Both personnel and repair and maintenance costs are expected to moderate more as we move into 2024. While we maintained our full year guidance range for real estate taxes, we are impacted by some timing-related pressure during the fourth quarter, as some of the initial favorability related to the Texas rate reduction is essentially offset by delays in litigation related to high valuations, which is being pushed into next year. We do expect real estate taxes overall to continue moderating over the next couple of years, as we work through the changing cap rate environment. We also reduced our total overhead cost projection for the year by $2 million to $126.5 million at the midpoint and we removed our disposition expectations for the current year, to reflect the current market conditions. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Brittany, will now turn the call back to you for questions.\nOperator: We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open. \nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just on the impact of the merchant builders delivering into a higher supply higher rate environment? It seems like it's changed the lease-up strategy. So I guess, is the largest impact here that rental rates have gone -- have moved lower and will remain lower longer. And so I guess, in initial expectations. So will this -- does this create more pressure in the near term and also for longer? Or is it just kind of a lower dip, before it gets better kind of seems like back half of 2024 early 2025.\nTim Argo: I mean I don't think it necessarily means longer. I think what did happen as we talked about it happened a little bit quicker. And I think the comments, I made about the treasury and developers get more aggressive called that moderation of new lease rates to occur a little bit earlier than we would have thought or a little bit quicker really. But we don't see much further deceleration. I think what we see is with renewal rates continuing to be strong, we're getting 5% on what we've set out or what we've got acceptance on for November and December the 5% range. The spread between new lease rates and renewal rates is pretty typical honestly, for this time of the year and tends to gap out both in Q4 and Q1. I think as you get into later into 2024, there will be some normal seasonality that will narrow that gap, but we'll be in this supply environment for the next few quarters, but don't expect materially worsening from here.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And are you seeing any difference in the performance between your Class B properties with your price stated discounted supply versus the Class A, which should be competing more in line with where the new supply is coming in? Like where is the pressure hitting the hard. Thank you.\nTim Argo: At a portfolio level, we're not seeing a huge difference between the performance of As and Bs. I will say at a market level some of our larger markets that are getting more of the supply we're seeing a little more pressure on some of those B+ A- assets where that gap has narrowed. But I do think that creates some opportunity longer term. Those new developments are going to stabilize, at some point at higher rents and that will create some opportunities there. But in some of our more mid-tier markets, smaller markets that are getting quite the supply pressure we're not seeing that pressure.\nEric Bolton: And I think it's worth noting that, even at the -- use of concessions is happening by some of the merchant developers, in the third quarter. The price gap between what we're seeing of the new product delivering in the market with those concessions as compared to the average rent in our portfolio, is still a spread of $300. That's down a little bit from $350 million, we saw in Q2 but it's still a pretty healthy spread there.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Last quarter Eric, you had mentioned, that you really didn't expect new lease rate growth to drop off and kind of highlighted that demand remained strong. So I guess, is it just been the cumulative impact of supply and concessions on lease-ups that's driven the softness? And really, how does that change your view around how 2024 market rent growth could shape up?\nEric Bolton: Well, Austin, I think that as Tim alluded to I mean the thing that frankly, was a little bit surprising in the third quarter was the more aggressive practices, taking place by some of the merchant developers that was directly impacting some of our product in some of the larger markets. We do think that there's -- it's interesting we were looking at just sort of what happened during the third quarter in terms of the sort of rapid ramp-up, of the junior treasuries. And -- and I think as developers are facing particularly merchant builders, who are facing a more competitive leasing landscape, with the reality of a prolonged high interest rate environment there was a motivation if you will to get pretty darn aggressive and trying to get leased up before we got into the holiday season. And so that affected market dynamics in some of our markets, and I think cause new lease pricing to moderate a little quicker than we would have otherwise thought, just because these merchant builders are a little bit of an urgency to get stabilized sooner rather than later. And so I think that that performance we think likely probably continues at some level probably for the next couple of quarters or so. As Tim mentioned, we don't \u2013 given the strong absorption that we see happening overall across our markets. It's hard to see it getting any worse than what we kind of saw in Q3. And then we're encouraged by the fact that October performance in the normal seasonal pattern that we see from Q3 to Q4 frankly is better than what we have seen in the past. So I mean there are reasons for us to feel that we think that the environment we find ourselves in right now is likely to sort of continue for a while probably through \u2013 I'm guessing through Q2 of next year. By the time we get to Q3 of next year comparing against this year we think that the \u2013 that things start to feel a lot more comfortable. Now we'll have the compounding effect of Q3, Q4, Q1 that we have to carry and kind of work through revenue performance through most of next year. But we think that there's arguments to be made that the supply-demand dynamics that we see taking place right now are likely to sort of hang where they are for the next few quarters but not get materially weaker.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And so I mean I guess that kind of went to my second question was it sounds like you think demand remains stable from here which has actually been fairly strong. I think even accelerated the last couple of quarters and helped absorb some of the supply. I mean is it fair to say that you think you get some level of market rent growth positive next year, despite kind of this cumulative impact based on your thoughts on how demand shakes out.\nEric Bolton: Yes, we do. I mean assuming that the economy continues to hold up as it is. We continue to capture the sort of tailwind that we're seeing with low resident turnover lower levels of move-outs to buy homes. Collections continue to remain strong. I mean there's just \u2013 as I've said for many years \u2013 to me at the end of the day what really drives performance over long haul is the demand side of the business. And that can \u2013 in the that's why we've always focused our capital in the way we have across the Sunbelt markets believing that the demand dynamic continues to provide a foundation for how we like to create value and drive performance over a long period of time. We have to deal with this periodic supply pressure that comes from time to time and that's kind of what we're dealing with right now. But because of the demand side being as strong as it is the absorption continues to be where it is and because of the approach that we take with diversification across the region we think there are things that we can do to help sort of mitigate some of the supply pressure that you otherwise might think would \u2013 if you look at just overall market dynamics we think that when you put the portfolio together the way that we have that we can push back against some of these supply pressures when they do occur from time to time. So I think that \u2013 we think that as we get into the back half of next year that we probably do start to see supply levels start to moderate and some of the developer pressures start to moderate. We will probably do start to see market rent growth turn positive on the new lease pricing. And then as Tim mentioned, we continue to get pretty solid performance on our renewal practices. And if you go back over a number of years you'll see that our renewal practices have always been fairly strong. And we take a certain approach to how we think about renewal pricing and we continue to believe that that will remain a tailwind for us over the coming year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks, Eric. Appreciate the detail response.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Your line is now open\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the answer there. You said that you don't expect new lease rates to get much worse from here. So I don't want to put words in your mouth but does that mean you're sort of expecting like negative 4% to negative 5% new lease for the foreseeable future? And should that continue through Q2 next year? Because it sounds like you're saying that what the dynamic you're seeing today should continue to 2Q and then probably get better as you get into the back half of the year?\nTim Argo: Hey, Eric, this is Tim. I mean I do think new lease rates probably hang in this range for a few months. Obviously, typically Q4 and Q1 are kind of weakest in terms of seasonality and the amount of traffic and all that. But I do think we will see some level of \u2013 and Eric hit on this a little bit some level of normal seasonality as we get into later to 2024. So I think as we get into March and April in the spring and the higher traffic volumes that we'll see some acceleration in those new lease rates. And I don't expect much change in renewals. We've been pretty consistent with our renewal rates going back for several years. We think those will hold up and we think the turnover rate remains low which provides the renewal side with more of that blend when you think about when the lease of our lease rates. So I think we're going to be in this range for a few months but I don't think it sticks like that for the next fall.\nEric Bolton: And we typically see the gap between new lease pricing on renewal pricing sort of gap out the most in Q4 and Q1, and then it tends to narrow in Q2 and Q3. And we think that that seasonal pattern is likely to repeat next year.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess that's my second question, which is that historically, I think you said, there's been about 500 to 600 basis points of spread on renewals versus new leases. There's nothing that would sort of change that just based on the supply dynamic today. It's not going to get wider or necessarily thinner. It's just -- it's probably going to be about the same spread as typical.\nTim Argo: Yes. And to clarify or put some color on that that 500 spread for us typically is what it is in the summer and kind of Q2, Q3 range with renewals remaining pretty consistent. Historically, Q4, Q1, Q4 is usually the biggest. It's usually in the 900 basis point range kind of similar to what we're seeing right now and then squeeze down to call it $700, $800 in Q1 and then get more on that 500 basis point range during the heart of the spring and summer. So, I don't really see -- that's the normal seasonality and would expect that to recurring some levels.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you and thanks for taking my question. So, it sounds like you could see a ramp-up here in acquisition activity investment activity. You had mentioned the Phoenix acquisition at $317,000 per unit. You also talked about a 5.5% yield. As you think about deals, I mean what are the metrics that you care about? Is it price per unit? Is it AFFO accretion? Is it NAV accretion? And then how do you think about your cost of capital and the required spread on your cost of capital is to put money to work?\nEric Bolton: Well, I mean the thing that we really prioritize more than anything is sort of what sort of stabilized yield do we think we will get from making a new investment and how does that compare to our current cost of capital. And as you think about cost of capital today and look at sort of where we are able to put our balance sheet to work at, call it, 5.5%, you think about longer perspective on cost of capital being a function of dividend yield and sort of FFO yield, core FFO yield. You blend that, you're still in that kind of 5.5% range. And so as we think about deal that we did in Phoenix. I mean the opportunity to put a brand new asset on the balance sheet that is going to be we think a great performer for us long-term to put that on the balance sheet initially. Even though it's still in sort of an initial lease up to be able to bring it on the balance sheet at basically right at our cost of capital with full understanding that we've got some real operating upside opportunity that we can capture over the first year or so from our revenue management practices and some of the cost efficiencies that we'll bring to bear on an operation that doesn't have those advantages coupled with the fact as Brad mentioned, this property is only -- it's less than half off of one of our other properties and we will over the next year or so pod, what we refer to as pod this property with the other and drive down some of the operating costs. We think over the next couple of years that we'll see that yield meaningfully go up from there. So we think at this point that makes a lot of sense to us. And I think that we're going to continue to we think see more of that opportunity emerge over the coming year.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And can you quantify how much you think the yield goes up with the revenue management and including the MAA touch on these assets?\nEric Bolton: I'd probably put it at, at least 100 basis point margin expansion to probably 200 somewhere in that range.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then secondly, you may have answered it with Eric's question but just thinking about October, I mean what can you tell us about rent blended rent new renewal rent so far in October?\nTim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. So for October as I mentioned the blended is right around zero. We're at about negative 5.3 on new lease and 4.4 on renewals as we stand right now.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then finally for me, Atlanta, specifically can you talk about -- I mean you had kind of below average revenue growth there. Is that pressure on rents from supply? Or is that more about some of the issues you've mentioned in the past fraud, some of the other kind of unique factors to that market?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, there's certainly a few unique factors in Atlanta and what you mentioned as part of that. I mean it's pricing, pricing is a little bit weak. It's a little bit lower than I would say some of our portfolio average. There we're getting some of the supply pressure that a lot of the other markets are getting as well. I think what we're seeing in Atlanta is a little more on the occupancy side. No, it has -- it is slowly improving. We saw a 40 basis point increase in occupancy from Q2 to Q3 in Atlanta. But there are a couple of unique circumstances that you mentioned, one, if you remember earlier in the year we talked about between the winter storm and a fire we had in Atlanta. We had a lot of down units that came on sort of late first, early seconds. So we were kind of working through that from an occupancy standpoint and then, has been well documented by a lot of people at some of the fraud concerns in Atlanta. And I think that's starting to work itself through as well. The courts are becoming a little more -- a little more aggressive on that. And we've seen the number of cases [ph] that we had in that market is about double from where it was last year. So, create some pressure in the short-term on occupancy but certainly longer term, in terms of revenue quality and ability to pay is much better. And we've also been able through in-house training we've done and really focused on fraud income. We've seen the number of people coming into the door we think is with that scenario is much less and we've seen our number of age balances we have in terms of residence is way down and just the amount of delinquency we have in Atlanta is way down. So some unique circumstances there for sure, but we think it's headed in the right direction.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And as you think about those factors is it -- if you pause on it being your largest market? I mean over the long term is that a reason you'd want to shrink there or grow in other markets more?\nEric Bolton : Well ,I mean, we continue to look at all the markets we probably over the next number of years we'll you'll probably see us continue to cycle some capital out of the Atlanta. It's going to be more driven by asset-specific decisions, property-specific decisions. I mean, we continue to like the Atlanta market long-term. A lot of great job growth drivers and demand drivers in that market. It's like all the other markets they will go through periods of supply pressure from time to time. But the demand dynamics there are pretty healthy. And I think some of the things that Tim is alluding to that were unique to Atlanta really are attributable to some of the practices that were adopted during the COVID years and the court systems there got really sort of backlog if you will and it's just taking longer for that market to sort of work back to normal. We see it happening. But we like the Atlanta market long term for sure. \nJamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get your loss to lease if you're able to quantify that.\nTim Argo : Yes, Nick, this is Tim. So a couple of comments there. If you look at sort of where we are right now and what's going to earn in or be baked in for next year with pricing today plus the pricing that we're assuming for Q4 probably have one to 1.25 of baked in or earned in if you will that will flow into 2024. Think about loss lease and just in terms of kind of where rents are right now it's probably about a negative one of lease given what we've seen with new lease rates right now that's where I would peg it in year in October. \nNick Yulico : Okay. It's very helpful. Just one other question. Going back to the acquisition and the 5.5% initial stable yield. Is that number impacted by concessions reducing that yield? I don't know if there's any way you can quantify like whether that would be a higher yield absent as there's concessions.\nBrad Hill : Hi. Nick, this is Brad. Yes I mean that's inclusive of concessions. The property is in lease-up and it's offering about a month to six weeks generally on new leases. And so that includes the impact of that. So that would be your net effective rent. So assuming that we get to stabilization we would see some strengthening there and the use of concessions would generally burn off on renewals. We're not using -- generally using concessions on these properties. We would also see some expansion in that yield at that point.\nNick Yulico : Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from John Kim with BMO. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of rising interest rates on leasing demand and landlord behavior. I know you commented that the demand has been strong. You had an occupancy pickup in the third quarter. So when you when you discuss new lease growth rates of minus 4% in September and minus 5.3% in October it seems to coincide with the interest rate environment. I just wanted to get your comment on that.\nEric Bolton : I think what we think is at play here is that in this environment with a lot of these merchant-built properties currently in lease-up the lease-up environment and the financing environment that they are facing today is most assuredly not what they contemplated when they started construction two years ago. And as a consequence of that I believe that what is happening is that some of the merchant-built product is in a rush to get stabilized as quickly as possible preferably before we even get into the holiday season which is why I think there was a lot of noticeable shift that took place in August and September because it's probably -- they're probably late in their time line in terms of what they forecast and what they underwrote. And certainly they are going to face an exit or refinancing that is going to be different than what was contemplated. And while there may have been some early hope that we would start to see moderation in interest rates by this time. I think that hope is now gone. And we likely are in this rate environment we are in today for quite some time moving forward. So I just think that all that is combined to create we knew in a highly high supply environment that lease-up pressure exists but I think it's just been a little bit more intense because of what's going on with the interest rate environment. And therefore, it's manifesting itself in more competitive pricing practices in an effort to attract new residents and leasing traffic. So I think that that's what's at play here. I think that once we sort of work through this scenario that as we've been talking about the supply picture starts to get a lot better, meaningfully better. And we think that we just got to put our head down and operate through this for the next -- in the next couple of quarters or so.\nJohn Kim: Can you comment on your turnover rate which declined 40 basis points? And remains in historically low levels, and how you are able to maintain this turnover rate with all the new supply that's coming online and if you're contemplating offering concessions I don't know.\nTim Argo: Hey, John. This is Tim. I mean, as far as the turnover I mean, we expected -- we certainly didn't really expect to turn over to scale up with all the factors that we see at play. I mean, between move-outs by house and move-outs for a job change those are far and away our two biggest reasons for move-outs. And as expected the move out by house is way down. So we don't see that again given the interest rate environment, we don't see that changing any time near term. Some of the other things that drove move out or turnover up last year are down. So I would expect as we get into 2024 that there's not a lot of change in terms of turnover certainly no significant increase in turnover, so I think that serves us well on the renewal side, that certainly we wouldn't need to look and do anything more than we're doing now on that renewal.\nEric Bolton: Encouragingly, I'll add in the third quarter the move-outs that we had that occurred due to rent increase were half of what they were in Q3 of last year. So what's really at play here on the turnover is just people are buying houses.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you, everyone, and Al congratulations on your retirement.\nAl Campbell: Yeah. Thank you, John. I'm excited about the prospects for the future, but also excited about what the company is going to do over the next few quarters and years as well.\nJohn Kim: We have the company in good hand. Thank you.\nAl Campbell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on a comment you made. It sounds like you're a bit surprised just by the competition from the new supply. I guess what is most surprising to you?\nEric Bolton: Well, we're not surprised by the competition from new supply. What we're surprised by is how aggressive some of the merchant developers have gotten in an effort to expedite their lease-up sooner than getting stabilized as quick as possible. And as I've commented on,k we think that that is related to what is clearly now an indication relating to interest rate trends. And we saw the behavior with lease-ups and concessions begin to shift a bit in August and September as the 10-year treasury really started moving up to 5% close to 5%. And I think it just triggered a urgency and developers that have lease-up projects on their books to get stabilized and get out of it or get it as soon as possible. So I think that that's what's a play here. And that -- so the -- that was probably the only thing that it was. The only thing I can point to that was a bit of a surprise. We expect the demand to remain solid and it is as Tim alluded to our desorption numbers across our markets are really strong. We've not seen any moderation on the demand side of the curve. We knew the supply picture. I mean there is no secret about that. We've seen that coming for the past year or so. So no real surprises there. It's really just the behavior of some of these lease-up projects and the motivation that they have to get leased up sooner rather than later. And I think that that goes right back to what I've just mentioned is that the recognition that the high rate environment we find ourselves in the interest rate environment is likely to be with us for a while. And I think it just prompted some actions on behalf of developers to get drop pricing introduce more concessions higher concessions drive down net effective pricing quicker which affected market dynamics to some degree.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that color. And maybe just a follow-up on that. If I think through it pretty sure peak deliveries are still in 2024. Is your assumption that this aggressive behavior kind of continues? Because I mean, I would assume that there's more properties coming online and the interest rates keep going higher they would want to kind of lease up as quick as possible. Do you think this competition gets heavier in 2024? Maybe that's my question there.\nEric Bolton: It's hard to say for sure, but the short answer is no I don't think so. [indiscernible] that is I think that where there is an urgency that's come into equation and a higher level of urgency by developers. I think to some degree a lot of it may be time to some calendar year-end pressures that they may be thinking about. I think that that perhaps is at play here a bit. When you think about supply levels being where they are, we don't it's -- of course it varies a lot by market. And we think that -- that the supply levels and deliveries that are taking place are likely to be fairly consistent to where they are right now for the next couple of quarters or so call it through Q2 of next year. And so it's hard to pinpoint it exactly but I don't think that there is a material change in the supply dynamic that we're seeing today. I don't think there's a material change in the demand dynamic that we see taking place today. And I think that the only change was if you will just that lease-up pressure that I think some of the developers were feeling given what's going on with the interest rates. And I think perhaps that there is some at least some of them that are facing some calendar year-end obligations that they're trying to think through as well.\nBrad Hill: Hey Josh this is Brad. I'll add color in two ways to that. Number one is just remember that developers are incentivized to lease up and sell quickly. Their IRRs are impacted obviously the sooner they sell an asset. And I think partly what's happened on these projects is according to our math generally they have to be about 90% occupied to cover their current debt service coverage through their cash flow without having to go back to their partner and ask for capital. So, to Eric's point I think once 10-year hit that psychological level of 4%. It was a realization that sales values are going to be impacted. So the sooner they could get to that point, the better for their IRR calculations and also for the waterfalls in those projects. So, I think that's driving to Eric's point by the end of the year and a quicker process of leasing up to cover debt service coverage and get to the point where they could transact the asset in order to drive higher waterfall promotes to themselves.\nJoshua Dennerlein: All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.\nJohn Pawlowski: Clay do you expect any notable acceleration or deceleration in the major expense categories throughout the next year?\nClay Holder: We do expect that there will be some moderation in operating expenses going into next year. You saw in the report that personnel costs and repair and maintenance costs were higher than what we had expected or projected but we still do expect those to continue to moderate as we move into next year.\nJohn Pawlowski: Roughly 6% property tax growth rate do you expect it to kind of bounce around this level for the foreseeable future?\nClay Holder: Probably -- that will probably moderate a little bit as well as the current environment that we're seeing with high prices and valuations as those begin to kind of taper down that should work its way through the real estate taxes. And so we expect to see some moderation there as well. How fast that will play through that remains to be seen.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me Tim. Hoping you can give us a sense for what new lease declines in October look like in a few of the most heavily supplied markets. I'm just curious what the kind of the bottom tranche of the portfolio looks like.\nTim Argo: New lease rates for October -- is that what you're saying John?\nJohn Pawlowski: For the most heavily supplied markets.\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean Austin continues to be the worst and we've talked about that for a while. Austin is in the high negative single-digits is our worst market in terms of new lease pricing. We like I said same-store level it's right around right around 5% for October. Tampa is a little bit higher but also is the one that kind of stands out above all.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Hey good morning everybody. It seems like the message here is that there are a few weak quarters ahead but the things are expected to get better in the back half of 2024. I'm just curious if you can give more color around what gives you confidence in that timing you do obviously have supply peaking in mid-2024, but it does still look elevated into 2025 and then the lease-ups don't end when the deliveries fall off. So curious for any thoughts there?\nEric Bolton: Well I think that what I would point to Brad this is Eric is just we continue to see a lot of support on the demand side and the absorption rates that we see taking place remain very healthy. And so I think that all the factors that are sort of supporting the demand side of the business the employment markets, low turnover, solid collections performance, wage growth, all those factors -- continued net positive migration trends. All those factors continue to look solid and there's nothing that we can see suggesting that moderation is set to occur in that regard. I think that as we sort of work through the current pipeline of deliveries that some of the behavior that is occurring right now likely starts to moderate a little bit as some of the more stressed lease-ups get sort of work through the system and some of the developers \u2013 one of the most pressure if you will sort of get work through the system. And then of course, as we start to get into the back half of next year, we've been through a complete cycle if you will with this pressure and the comparisons to the prior leases and the comparisons to the prior year start to get a little bit more tolerable if you will. So I just think that we feel like that we've got call it two or three quarters of this environment. You've got seasonal patterns at play here too. You recognize that the Q3 is the point of the year where moderation has typically always occurred anyway from a leasing perspective and then it sort of works through Q4 and then by Q1, particularly, in February and particularly in March things start to pick up and then you get into the spring and the summer and the absorption rate picks up even more. So I think that to have what we have now happening in one of the weaker quarters of the year from a seasonality perspective and early on in the delivery sort of pressure pipeline I think that it gives us some reason in comfort that by the time we get to the back half of next year the conditions start to change a bit.\nBradley Heffern: Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nConnor Mitchell: Thanks for taking my question. So you can just discuss the rising labor cost a little bit and maybe that's especially with third-party vendors. So just thinking about that it'd be fair to presume that your markets are strong economically which would bode well for demand. So thinking about the big picture would it be fair to say that demand and rent growth are healthy enough to offset the rising labor costs?\nEric Bolton: Well I mean the demand is strong, but in terms of revenue growth I mean the problem we're facing is -- or the challenge we're facing is just a lot of supply in the pipeline right now. And that's what's really -- that sort of supply-demand dynamic is not as strong as it had been. And so that's what's really creating this spread if you -- if you will between sort of, rent growth and what we see taking place with growth rate and labor costs. As Clay alludes to we are seeing at least with our own sort of hiring practices that we are starting to see a little moderation begin to show up. And -- and we do think that as we get into -- and as Brad alluded to we're seeing a lot of evidence out there with some of the people we talk to various vendors that -- and architecture and others would work with on the development side that the construction workforce is starting to have a little bit more availability and it's not quite as much in demand. And that to some degree affects our labor costs as it relates to our maintenance operations. So -- we do think as Clay alluded to we do think that we likely are looking at some moderation in labor cost from the growth rate that we're seeing today. We expect some moderation on that as we get into next year.\nConnor Mitchell: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe sticking with demand. You've referenced that demand is really the driving force align supply comes and goes. Could you just maybe rank how bike historically how strong demand is in the pace of demand in this year and maybe heading into the year-end compared to previous years in cycles?\nEric Bolton: Well I mean -- Tim you want to add anything to.\nTim Argo: I was just going to make one point that at a high level we've done some research and with some of our third-party data as you go back the last five years or so or really, really the last five or 10 years. The highest supplied markets which tend to have been in the Sunbelt have also been some of the best rate growth markets and that's because of the demand side. So we have historically over the long term demand has more than offset the supply picture. Now we have an elevated supply picture right now that's put that out of the balance at least for a temporary time. But as we get into late next year and over the long term historically has shown and we believe continue to show all the demand fundamentals show that over the long term that demand outpaces the supply.\nEric Bolton: I can't tell you compared to, sort of, the migration numbers that we saw kind of throw the COVID years out which were a bit unusual. But the level of net in migration that we see happening right now is still higher than it was historically higher than it was before COVID. And so these Sunbelt markets continue to offer a lot of things that employers are looking for and so that component of the demand cycle I think is better than it historically has been. I will also tell you that the move out to home buying and tailwind that we are getting on demand is a consequence of that have never been this strong either. And so, there are some unique variables out there right now that continue to support demand at a level that is stronger than what we've seen historically.\nConnor Mitchell: Okay. I appreciate the color. And maybe if I could just sneak one more in. Going back to Atlanta. Did you mention that you're recapturing some of the units due to the fraud issues? Or would you be able to provide a time line on when you would recapture those units? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Well, I mean it's an ongoing process. I think what we've seen is that for a period from COVID up until really early this year, the counties in Atlanta specifically have been really slow to act or take any action whatsoever. So, we've seen that start to accelerate. Horton County is still a little bit of an issue, but [indiscernible] have increased their activities. So we see it starting to happen. But -- and I think we've gotten through a lot of it but it will continue over the next few months. And I think as we get into later next year, we're back into more of a normal situation in terms of Atlanta. Like I said, we've done a lot of work to make sure we're not exacerbating the problem by letting any potential fraudulent people coming in the front door.\nConnor Mitchell: All right. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from [indiscernible]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good morning. So getting back to the acquisition strategy I think one of the problems over the years is they bought when they should be selling and they've sold when they should be buying. So, what you're saying is interesting. I'm wondering the speed by which this strategy can unfold. You talked about the implied cost of your equity. If you were -- your balance sheet is obviously very attractive, but perhaps inefficiently so at 3.4 times debt that leaves $1.3 billion or so of more debt you could put on just to get to 4.5 times. So maybe that's untouchable now in the rate environment. But I'm just curious you've got the amount to finance this. Could this be some sizable activity at this point? Or do you think it will be more like one-off asset by asset like non needle-moving type of stuff for the time being?\nJoe Fracchia: Well we hope it will be needle moving. We're optimistic Rich that there will be certainly more buying opportunity emerging over the coming year. Now having said that, there are a lot of people, with a lot of dry powder right now and I think multifamily real estate is still viewed as an attractive commercial real estate asset class. And everybody understands the need for housing in the country. And I think there's a more healthy appreciation for the Sunbelt markets perhaps than there has been in a number of years. And so we think that while the opportunity to buy and the transaction market gets better, we think that it will also potentially be pretty competitive. We would hope to -- going back to the last recession 2008, 2009, the two years coming out of that downturn. We bought 7,000 apartments over a two-year period of time. I think -- I don't see that getting repeated, but we do think that the opportunity set will be more plentiful for us going over the coming year than it has been certainly for the last four or five years. In this higher rate environment some of the private equity players are not going to be quite as -- be able to be quite as aggressive as they have been. There's more of a sort of an equilibrium in terms of cost of capital between us and the and the private guys given their higher use of debt. And you're right. I mean we've got a lot of capacity on the balance sheet. We're anxious to put it to work, but we're going to remain disciplined about it. But we do think that the opportunities definitely start to pick up and we're hopeful it will be significant.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then second question maybe to Tim or others, but on the October spread between new and renewal, pendulum on these sort of growth numbers always swings too wide. I don't think anyone expected 20%-plus type of rent growth a year ago and maybe this is surprising to the downside. When you think about the first half of 2024, should we be conditioning all of us investors and analysts for negative blended number at least for the first half of the year when you think about that pendulum factor or is zero your kind of number from this point forward you're not giving guidance but is there a range of sort of surprise factor that could bring that into negative territory at least for a period of time next year?\nTim Argo: Zero is what we have dialed in for Q4 in terms of our forecast which as we said is kind of where we sit right now for October and Q1 typically compared to Q4 if I'm thinking about sort of normal environment or historical environment is usually pretty similar. I do think -- I think you could see those numbers move a little bit on the margins up or down in terms of blended that's going slightly negative or slightly positive. I do say as we get -- as I mentioned earlier as we get into the spring I think you start to see some normal seasonality in terms of new lease rates. We're not going to jump up to positive three or four all of a sudden I do think you'll see some acceleration. So there'll be some bands, but I don't think it's widely different than what you talked about because we do think renewals remain pretty consistent and with where we see turnover going that will blend in as a little bit bigger factor in terms of the overall blended rate as compared to new leases.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, good enough. And congrats to Al, good luck to you.\nAl Campbell: Thanks Rich. I appreciate it man.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Quick question on the transaction environment, I think you mentioned that you saw cap rates increase by 15 basis points in the third quarter. Given where interest rates have not given where public market, stocks, I would expect that to maybe expand a bit more. So where do you think cap rates go the next few quarters that you seek to deploy more capital here? \nBrad Hill: Hi, Anthony, this is Brad. I mean, I think a couple of things. One, keep in mind that what we saw in the third quarter was very limited in terms of transactions. Certainly we -- as I mentioned in my comments we saw activity -- marketing activity pick up a bit early in the third quarter, but a lot of that has not closed at this point really just a handful of projects closed and we saw those cap rates come up a little bit. But to Eric's point earlier about the availability of capital for well-located properties in good markets, we continue to see strong bedsheets for those. And so and we're still seeing cap rates in the low 5% range for those well-located assets. I would expect to see pressure on cap rates. But really it's going to depend on how that liquidity shows up for those assets to bid on them. But certainly given the severe movement that we've seen in the 10-year. And agency debt today is in the 6.5%, 6.75% range, we would expect some upward movement in cap rates but to what degree is going to depend on the liquidity picture, the fundamentals of the properties locations things of that nature. So it's really hard to say where that goes from here.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. And maybe on turnover and renewal rent growth. How aware are tenants typically of a highly growth environment like this? And are you seeing tenants come to you and ask for rent declines, seeing tenants move out to newer buildings? And is that a risk next year as more of these apartments are delivered in your market? \nTim Argo: Well, I think certainly they're aware. I mean the transparency now with what's on websites and social media and everything else and all the different marketing avenues and advertising platforms that certainly they're aware and you can see down to a unit level a lot of times on websites. But probably tell a new phenomenon. It's been that way now at least for the last couple of years. So I think there's a component of the renewal side of just you've hopefully provide them with good resident service. They're happy where they're living. They're happy with the manager and their owner. And there are some friction costs involved as well. It\u2019s pain to move, it\u2019s expensive to move. So there are some things from a customer service and a friction cost standpoint that are meaningful. But overall as we talked about I'll see turnover changing much from where it is now. So I don't think that becomes any more of an outsized pressure than it has been.\nAnthony Powell: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.\nWes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. I have a question on the capital allocation front. I mean, is there a point where you buyback to maybe become a top priority when you consider were development yield are penciling-in and acquisition yields. And then they seem pretty thin where the 10-year trading and typically acquisition cap rates have been north of 100, 200 basis points over the 10-year. So it seems that gives them the upward pressure in the private market.\nBrad Hill: Well, again as we touched on a little earlier I mean, we think that the opportunity to put capital work as we did with the Phoenix acquisition is the appropriate and best value creation from a long-term perspective, particularly given where the initial yield is and the opportunity we have we think over the next couple of years to really improve that yield meaningfully. So we continue to believe that remaining patient with the balance sheet capacity we have and looking for what we are expecting to be even more compelling opportunities as we move forward with some of the distress in the market from some of these merchant builders that the longer-term value creation associated with some of these acquisitions is going to make a lot more sense. As Brad mentioned, we do have -- of opportunity teeing up on the development front but we control the timing on that. And we do think that we're going to see some moderation begin to take place with the construction cost and we think the yields there are going to get better. So we -- and as I say we've got the luxury of making controlling the timing of when we elect to pull the trigger on those projects. And of course, these projects if we were to start anything next year, I mean, it's going to deliver in '26 and '27 and it's going to be we think healthier leasing environment at that point. So we're going to be patient but we think that some of the external growth opportunities that we have in front of us over the coming couple of years is the best sort of value creation opportunity that we have in terms of how to put this balance sheet capacity to work.\nWes Golladay: And a follow-up to that are you seeing any portfolios or maybe somewhat aggregated assets and maybe debt was underwritten at a very low cap rate environment or maybe a lot of floating rate debt. Is there anything kind of penciled in to fit your quality criteria? . \nEric Bolton: Well we pay attention to those opportunities when they come out. More often than not what we have found is the asset quality is not really what we want to do and not of interest to us. And a lot of the aggressive buying and high leverage buying that took place over the last few years. A lot of it was associated with sort of a lower price point product to our current portfolio and just -- we haven't found it to be particularly compelling to add to our balance sheet.\nWes Golladay: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats.\nEric Bolton: Thank you, Wes. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLinda Tsai: Just one really quick one. Can you remind us of what's causing higher fraud in certain markets? Is it demographic shift technology? And then what are mitigation strategies. \nTim Argo: I mean, it's difficult to say. I think what we have seen is certainly since COVID and post-COVID that the actions taken by the courts and the judges and that sort of thing has become a little bit more lax so that frankly creates a little bit more opportunity for bad actors. What we've done in turn is -- we've familiarized ourselves and have some experts so to speak within our team that are good at identifying that sort of thing. And frankly, what happens is if you get -- you start to get a reputation, if you will that these guys are good at catching it and the people trying to the front door that way tend to stay away. So it starts to solve itself from some standpoint, if you can be good at detecting it and good at defending it preventing it.\nEric Bolton: And Linda I'd add a couple of things to that. I do think that new technology that's available to people today has probably fostered some opportunity and techniques and certain capabilities in this area that are different certainly than where they were years ago and probably a little bit harder to detect. And we've made some modifications in our approval processes and how we screen that is now much more effective at that. And the other thing, I would just comment on that you alluded to is -- it's important to recognize that where we have seen this has really been pretty isolated. We've called out Atlanta and frankly just a few properties in the Atlanta market where we saw this in a pickup in a noticeable way. I wouldn't suggest that this is a pervasive practice that we see happening across the portfolio in a lot of different markets. It was really more of an isolated scenario. It happens to be Atlanta where we have a lot. But -- and as Tim mentioned we see the trends changing there as a consequence and improving as a consequence of some of the changes that we've made in our approval processes.\nLinda Tsai: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will turn the call over to MAA for closing remarks.\nAndrew Schaeffer: We appreciate everyone joining us this morning and I'm sure we'll see most of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. So thank you.\nOperator: That conclude today's program for participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew and good morning. MAA's third quarter FFO performance was ahead of our expectations as the demand side of our business continues to capture good leasing traffic, low resident turnover, positive migration trends, and strong collections performance. During the quarter, we did see a higher impact from new supply deliveries across several of our larger markets with the resulting impact showing up in pricing associated with new move-in residents, while we continue to believe that MAA's unique market diversification a more affordable rent structure and an experienced and capable operating platform will enable us to push back against some of the supply pressure. The high volume of new deliveries in several markets will continue to weigh on rent growth associated with new resident move-ins for the next few quarters. Encouragingly, there is now clear evidence emerging that new supply deliveries are poised to meaningfully drop late next year into 2025. We have certainly worked through these supply cycles before and continue to believe that MAA's more extensive market and submarket diversification new AI and technology tools and an experienced operating team has us in a position to outperform our markets. As we have discussed previously one of the benefits that typically emerges from a heavy supply cycle particularly one that is characterized by higher interest rates is an increasing volume of acquisition and external growth opportunities. We have seen a shift take place with seller and developer pricing expectations. The more challenging lease-up conditions coupled with higher interest rates that are likely to be with us for a while are generating more buying opportunities. As Brad will recap in his comments the property acquisition we completed after quarter end is a good example of where we expect more opportunities to emerge specifically a recently completed new development that is still in initial lease-up with seller requirements to close within a short timeframe. Before turning the call over to the team to provide details surrounding our performance and market conditions, let me summarize what I believe are the four key takeaways in our report. First, demand across our markets remain solid and supportive of steady absorption of the new supply. Secondly, current high levels of new supply coupled with developer pressures related to the higher interest rate environment will cause the leasing environment to remain competitive for the next few quarters with new supply pressures expected to then decline. We expect to see an increasing number of compelling external growth opportunities in 2024. And four, MAA's long track record of performance and experience in working with markets with higher demand and supply dynamics now further supported by a stronger technology platform and a strong balance sheet with significant capacity has the company in very well position as we work through the current cycle. And with that I'll now turn the call over to Brad. And I think it's worth noting that, even at the -- use of concessions is happening by some of the merchant developers, in the third quarter. The price gap between what we're seeing of the new product delivering in the market with those concessions as compared to the average rent in our portfolio, is still a spread of $300. That's down a little bit from $350 million, we saw in Q2 but it's still a pretty healthy spread there. Well, Austin, I think that as Tim alluded to I mean the thing that frankly, was a little bit surprising in the third quarter was the more aggressive practices, taking place by some of the merchant developers that was directly impacting some of our product in some of the larger markets. We do think that there's -- it's interesting we were looking at just sort of what happened during the third quarter in terms of the sort of rapid ramp-up, of the junior treasuries. And -- and I think as developers are facing particularly merchant builders, who are facing a more competitive leasing landscape, with the reality of a prolonged high interest rate environment there was a motivation if you will to get pretty darn aggressive and trying to get leased up before we got into the holiday season. And so that affected market dynamics in some of our markets, and I think cause new lease pricing to moderate a little quicker than we would have otherwise thought, just because these merchant builders are a little bit of an urgency to get stabilized sooner rather than later. And so I think that that performance we think likely probably continues at some level probably for the next couple of quarters or so. As Tim mentioned, we don't \u2013 given the strong absorption that we see happening overall across our markets. It's hard to see it getting any worse than what we kind of saw in Q3. And then we're encouraged by the fact that October performance in the normal seasonal pattern that we see from Q3 to Q4 frankly is better than what we have seen in the past. So I mean there are reasons for us to feel that we think that the environment we find ourselves in right now is likely to sort of continue for a while probably through \u2013 I'm guessing through Q2 of next year. By the time we get to Q3 of next year comparing against this year we think that the \u2013 that things start to feel a lot more comfortable. Now we'll have the compounding effect of Q3, Q4, Q1 that we have to carry and kind of work through revenue performance through most of next year. But we think that there's arguments to be made that the supply-demand dynamics that we see taking place right now are likely to sort of hang where they are for the next few quarters but not get materially weaker. Yes, we do. I mean assuming that the economy continues to hold up as it is. We continue to capture the sort of tailwind that we're seeing with low resident turnover lower levels of move-outs to buy homes. Collections continue to remain strong. I mean there's just \u2013 as I've said for many years \u2013 to me at the end of the day what really drives performance over long haul is the demand side of the business. And that can \u2013 in the that's why we've always focused our capital in the way we have across the Sunbelt markets believing that the demand dynamic continues to provide a foundation for how we like to create value and drive performance over a long period of time. We have to deal with this periodic supply pressure that comes from time to time and that's kind of what we're dealing with right now. But because of the demand side being as strong as it is the absorption continues to be where it is and because of the approach that we take with diversification across the region we think there are things that we can do to help sort of mitigate some of the supply pressure that you otherwise might think would \u2013 if you look at just overall market dynamics we think that when you put the portfolio together the way that we have that we can push back against some of these supply pressures when they do occur from time to time. So I think that \u2013 we think that as we get into the back half of next year that we probably do start to see supply levels start to moderate and some of the developer pressures start to moderate. We will probably do start to see market rent growth turn positive on the new lease pricing. And then as Tim mentioned, we continue to get pretty solid performance on our renewal practices. And if you go back over a number of years you'll see that our renewal practices have always been fairly strong. And we take a certain approach to how we think about renewal pricing and we continue to believe that that will remain a tailwind for us over the coming year. And we typically see the gap between new lease pricing on renewal pricing sort of gap out the most in Q4 and Q1, and then it tends to narrow in Q2 and Q3. And we think that that seasonal pattern is likely to repeat next year. Well, I mean the thing that we really prioritize more than anything is sort of what sort of stabilized yield do we think we will get from making a new investment and how does that compare to our current cost of capital. And as you think about cost of capital today and look at sort of where we are able to put our balance sheet to work at, call it, 5.5%, you think about longer perspective on cost of capital being a function of dividend yield and sort of FFO yield, core FFO yield. You blend that, you're still in that kind of 5.5% range. And so as we think about deal that we did in Phoenix. I mean the opportunity to put a brand new asset on the balance sheet that is going to be we think a great performer for us long-term to put that on the balance sheet initially. Even though it's still in sort of an initial lease up to be able to bring it on the balance sheet at basically right at our cost of capital with full understanding that we've got some real operating upside opportunity that we can capture over the first year or so from our revenue management practices and some of the cost efficiencies that we'll bring to bear on an operation that doesn't have those advantages coupled with the fact as Brad mentioned, this property is only -- it's less than half off of one of our other properties and we will over the next year or so pod, what we refer to as pod this property with the other and drive down some of the operating costs. We think over the next couple of years that we'll see that yield meaningfully go up from there. So we think at this point that makes a lot of sense to us. And I think that we're going to continue to we think see more of that opportunity emerge over the coming year. I'd probably put it at, at least 100 basis point margin expansion to probably 200 somewhere in that range. Well ,I mean, we continue to look at all the markets we probably over the next number of years we'll you'll probably see us continue to cycle some capital out of the Atlanta. It's going to be more driven by asset-specific decisions, property-specific decisions. I mean, we continue to like the Atlanta market long-term. A lot of great job growth drivers and demand drivers in that market. It's like all the other markets they will go through periods of supply pressure from time to time. But the demand dynamics there are pretty healthy. And I think some of the things that Tim is alluding to that were unique to Atlanta really are attributable to some of the practices that were adopted during the COVID years and the court systems there got really sort of backlog if you will and it's just taking longer for that market to sort of work back to normal. We see it happening. But we like the Atlanta market long term for sure. I think what we think is at play here is that in this environment with a lot of these merchant-built properties currently in lease-up the lease-up environment and the financing environment that they are facing today is most assuredly not what they contemplated when they started construction two years ago. And as a consequence of that I believe that what is happening is that some of the merchant-built product is in a rush to get stabilized as quickly as possible preferably before we even get into the holiday season which is why I think there was a lot of noticeable shift that took place in August and September because it's probably -- they're probably late in their time line in terms of what they forecast and what they underwrote. And certainly they are going to face an exit or refinancing that is going to be different than what was contemplated. And while there may have been some early hope that we would start to see moderation in interest rates by this time. I think that hope is now gone. And we likely are in this rate environment we are in today for quite some time moving forward. So I just think that all that is combined to create we knew in a highly high supply environment that lease-up pressure exists but I think it's just been a little bit more intense because of what's going on with the interest rate environment. And therefore, it's manifesting itself in more competitive pricing practices in an effort to attract new residents and leasing traffic. So I think that that's what's at play here. I think that once we sort of work through this scenario that as we've been talking about the supply picture starts to get a lot better, meaningfully better. And we think that we just got to put our head down and operate through this for the next -- in the next couple of quarters or so. Encouragingly, I'll add in the third quarter the move-outs that we had that occurred due to rent increase were half of what they were in Q3 of last year. So what's really at play here on the turnover is just people are buying houses. Well, we're not surprised by the competition from new supply. What we're surprised by is how aggressive some of the merchant developers have gotten in an effort to expedite their lease-up sooner than getting stabilized as quick as possible. And as I've commented on,k we think that that is related to what is clearly now an indication relating to interest rate trends. And we saw the behavior with lease-ups and concessions begin to shift a bit in August and September as the 10-year treasury really started moving up to 5% close to 5%. And I think it just triggered a urgency and developers that have lease-up projects on their books to get stabilized and get out of it or get it as soon as possible. So I think that that's what's a play here. And that -- so the -- that was probably the only thing that it was. The only thing I can point to that was a bit of a surprise. We expect the demand to remain solid and it is as Tim alluded to our desorption numbers across our markets are really strong. We've not seen any moderation on the demand side of the curve. We knew the supply picture. I mean there is no secret about that. We've seen that coming for the past year or so. So no real surprises there. It's really just the behavior of some of these lease-up projects and the motivation that they have to get leased up sooner rather than later. And I think that that goes right back to what I've just mentioned is that the recognition that the high rate environment we find ourselves in the interest rate environment is likely to be with us for a while. And I think it just prompted some actions on behalf of developers to get drop pricing introduce more concessions higher concessions drive down net effective pricing quicker which affected market dynamics to some degree. It's hard to say for sure, but the short answer is no I don't think so. [indiscernible] that is I think that where there is an urgency that's come into equation and a higher level of urgency by developers. I think to some degree a lot of it may be time to some calendar year-end pressures that they may be thinking about. I think that that perhaps is at play here a bit. When you think about supply levels being where they are, we don't it's -- of course it varies a lot by market. And we think that -- that the supply levels and deliveries that are taking place are likely to be fairly consistent to where they are right now for the next couple of quarters or so call it through Q2 of next year. And so it's hard to pinpoint it exactly but I don't think that there is a material change in the supply dynamic that we're seeing today. I don't think there's a material change in the demand dynamic that we see taking place today. And I think that the only change was if you will just that lease-up pressure that I think some of the developers were feeling given what's going on with the interest rates. And I think perhaps that there is some at least some of them that are facing some calendar year-end obligations that they're trying to think through as well. Well I think that what I would point to Brad this is Eric is just we continue to see a lot of support on the demand side and the absorption rates that we see taking place remain very healthy. And so I think that all the factors that are sort of supporting the demand side of the business the employment markets, low turnover, solid collections performance, wage growth, all those factors -- continued net positive migration trends. All those factors continue to look solid and there's nothing that we can see suggesting that moderation is set to occur in that regard. I think that as we sort of work through the current pipeline of deliveries that some of the behavior that is occurring right now likely starts to moderate a little bit as some of the more stressed lease-ups get sort of work through the system and some of the developers \u2013 one of the most pressure if you will sort of get work through the system. And then of course, as we start to get into the back half of next year, we've been through a complete cycle if you will with this pressure and the comparisons to the prior leases and the comparisons to the prior year start to get a little bit more tolerable if you will. So I just think that we feel like that we've got call it two or three quarters of this environment. You've got seasonal patterns at play here too. You recognize that the Q3 is the point of the year where moderation has typically always occurred anyway from a leasing perspective and then it sort of works through Q4 and then by Q1, particularly, in February and particularly in March things start to pick up and then you get into the spring and the summer and the absorption rate picks up even more. So I think that to have what we have now happening in one of the weaker quarters of the year from a seasonality perspective and early on in the delivery sort of pressure pipeline I think that it gives us some reason in comfort that by the time we get to the back half of next year the conditions start to change a bit. Well I mean the demand is strong, but in terms of revenue growth I mean the problem we're facing is -- or the challenge we're facing is just a lot of supply in the pipeline right now. And that's what's really -- that sort of supply-demand dynamic is not as strong as it had been. And so that's what's really creating this spread if you -- if you will between sort of, rent growth and what we see taking place with growth rate and labor costs. As Clay alludes to we are seeing at least with our own sort of hiring practices that we are starting to see a little moderation begin to show up. And -- and we do think that as we get into -- and as Brad alluded to we're seeing a lot of evidence out there with some of the people we talk to various vendors that -- and architecture and others would work with on the development side that the construction workforce is starting to have a little bit more availability and it's not quite as much in demand. And that to some degree affects our labor costs as it relates to our maintenance operations. So -- we do think as Clay alluded to we do think that we likely are looking at some moderation in labor cost from the growth rate that we're seeing today. We expect some moderation on that as we get into next year. Well I mean -- Tim you want to add anything to. I can't tell you compared to, sort of, the migration numbers that we saw kind of throw the COVID years out which were a bit unusual. But the level of net in migration that we see happening right now is still higher than it was historically higher than it was before COVID. And so these Sunbelt markets continue to offer a lot of things that employers are looking for and so that component of the demand cycle I think is better than it historically has been. I will also tell you that the move out to home buying and tailwind that we are getting on demand is a consequence of that have never been this strong either. And so, there are some unique variables out there right now that continue to support demand at a level that is stronger than what we've seen historically. Well we pay attention to those opportunities when they come out. More often than not what we have found is the asset quality is not really what we want to do and not of interest to us. And a lot of the aggressive buying and high leverage buying that took place over the last few years. A lot of it was associated with sort of a lower price point product to our current portfolio and just -- we haven't found it to be particularly compelling to add to our balance sheet. Thank you, Wes. Appreciate it. And Linda I'd add a couple of things to that. I do think that new technology that's available to people today has probably fostered some opportunity and techniques and certain capabilities in this area that are different certainly than where they were years ago and probably a little bit harder to detect. And we've made some modifications in our approval processes and how we screen that is now much more effective at that. And the other thing, I would just comment on that you alluded to is -- it's important to recognize that where we have seen this has really been pretty isolated. We've called out Atlanta and frankly just a few properties in the Atlanta market where we saw this in a pickup in a noticeable way. I wouldn't suggest that this is a pervasive practice that we see happening across the portfolio in a lot of different markets. It was really more of an isolated scenario. It happens to be Atlanta where we have a lot. But -- and as Tim mentioned we see the trends changing there as a consequence and improving as a consequence of some of the changes that we've made in our approval processes."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. As anticipated we saw an increase in for-sale marketing activity emerge early in the third quarter. And while closed transactions are limited in number, we continue to see some upward pressure on cap rates on projects we track, with cap rates up by roughly 15 basis points from 2Q. As indicated in our earnings release, we recently closed the Phoenix market that we began pursuing early in 3Q. MAA Central Avenue is a 323-unit mid-rise property that fits the profile of the type of opportunities we expected to emerge. The property is in its initial lease-up and the seller was under some pressure to close on the sale by a specific date. So, counterparty risk considerations were paramount to the seller. Our familiarity with the market, speed of execution and balance sheet strength that supports an ability to close all cash with no financing contingencies were all aspects of our offer that were very important to the sellers. Our pricing of approximately $317,000 per unit is substantially below current replacement costs and is expected to provide an initial stabilized NOI yield of 5.5%. With the property nearing stabilization, we expect over the following year or so to capture further margin and yield expansion opportunities as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management practices and technology platform coupled with our future ability to achieve operational synergies with another MAA property that is only half a mile away. Our transaction team is very active in evaluating other acquisition opportunities across our footprint. And Al and Clay have our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of additional compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year and into 2024. Despite pressure from elevated supply our new properties in their initial lease-up continued to deliver strong performance producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties on average have captured in-place rents 15% above our original expectations. For the five properties that are either leasing or will start leasing by the end of the year this rent outperformance which is partially offset by higher expenses including taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.7% significantly higher than our original expectations. Leasing has progressed well at MA Windmill Hill in Austin and we expect this community to stabilize this quarter. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to some permitting and approval delays three projects that we plan to start this year will likely instead start in early 2024. In a number of markets -- in a number of our markets, construction costs have been slower to adjust than we expected, but we continue to see signs that a broader reduction in cost is likely to come. Numerous consultants that we work with including architects and engineers have indicated their volume of work has significantly decreased in the last few months providing further evidence of a decline in new construction activity. Additionally, general contractors are indicating they have more capacity to start new projects and in many cases with a larger pool of subcontractors available. In addition to the three projects mentioned that we expect to start over the next six months, we have five more projects representing approximately 1,320 units that could be ready for construction start by the end of 2024. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today we own or control 13 well-located sites representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects allowing us to maintain our patience and discipline when making capital deployment decisions. Any project we start in 2024 will deliver units into a stronger leasing environment with lower competitive supply in late 2025 and 2026. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this more constrained liquidity environment we are hopeful that we may find additional development opportunities to add to our future pipeline. In addition to continuously monitoring the construction market and evaluating costs at our projects in predevelopment, our construction management team is focused on completing and delivering our remaining five under construction projects. During the third quarter the team successfully wrapped up construction on novel West Midtown in Atlanta completing the delivery of all 340 units. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that I'll turn the call over to Tim. Hi. Nick, this is Brad. Yes I mean that's inclusive of concessions. The property is in lease-up and it's offering about a month to six weeks generally on new leases. And so that includes the impact of that. So that would be your net effective rent. So assuming that we get to stabilization we would see some strengthening there and the use of concessions would generally burn off on renewals. We're not using -- generally using concessions on these properties. We would also see some expansion in that yield at that point. Hey Josh this is Brad. I'll add color in two ways to that. Number one is just remember that developers are incentivized to lease up and sell quickly. Their IRRs are impacted obviously the sooner they sell an asset. And I think partly what's happened on these projects is according to our math generally they have to be about 90% occupied to cover their current debt service coverage through their cash flow without having to go back to their partner and ask for capital. So, to Eric's point I think once 10-year hit that psychological level of 4%. It was a realization that sales values are going to be impacted. So the sooner they could get to that point, the better for their IRR calculations and also for the waterfalls in those projects. So, I think that's driving to Eric's point by the end of the year and a quicker process of leasing up to cover debt service coverage and get to the point where they could transact the asset in order to drive higher waterfall promotes to themselves. Hi, Anthony, this is Brad. I mean, I think a couple of things. One, keep in mind that what we saw in the third quarter was very limited in terms of transactions. Certainly we -- as I mentioned in my comments we saw activity -- marketing activity pick up a bit early in the third quarter, but a lot of that has not closed at this point really just a handful of projects closed and we saw those cap rates come up a little bit. But to Eric's point earlier about the availability of capital for well-located properties in good markets, we continue to see strong bedsheets for those. And so and we're still seeing cap rates in the low 5% range for those well-located assets. I would expect to see pressure on cap rates. But really it's going to depend on how that liquidity shows up for those assets to bid on them. But certainly given the severe movement that we've seen in the 10-year. And agency debt today is in the 6.5%, 6.75% range, we would expect some upward movement in cap rates but to what degree is going to depend on the liquidity picture, the fundamentals of the properties locations things of that nature. So it's really hard to say where that goes from here. Well, again as we touched on a little earlier I mean, we think that the opportunity to put capital work as we did with the Phoenix acquisition is the appropriate and best value creation from a long-term perspective, particularly given where the initial yield is and the opportunity we have we think over the next couple of years to really improve that yield meaningfully. So we continue to believe that remaining patient with the balance sheet capacity we have and looking for what we are expecting to be even more compelling opportunities as we move forward with some of the distress in the market from some of these merchant builders that the longer-term value creation associated with some of these acquisitions is going to make a lot more sense. As Brad mentioned, we do have -- of opportunity teeing up on the development front but we control the timing on that. And we do think that we're going to see some moderation begin to take place with the construction cost and we think the yields there are going to get better. So we -- and as I say we've got the luxury of making controlling the timing of when we elect to pull the trigger on those projects. And of course, these projects if we were to start anything next year, I mean, it's going to deliver in '26 and '27 and it's going to be we think healthier leasing environment at that point. So we're going to be patient but we think that some of the external growth opportunities that we have in front of us over the coming couple of years is the best sort of value creation opportunity that we have in terms of how to put this balance sheet capacity to work."

            "content": "Thank you, Clay, and good morning everyone. Given the third quarter performance outlined by Clay as well as expectations for the remainder of the year we have updated and narrowed our guidance ranges for the year which is detailed in the supplement to our release. Overall, the third quarter core FFO favorability primarily related to overhead and interest costs is expected to be essentially offset by higher-than-projected same-store operating expenses for the remainder of the year, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment. Thus, we're maintaining the midpoint of our core FFO projection for the full year of $9.14 per share which reflects a 7.5% growth over the prior year. The midpoint of our total revenue growth projection for the year remains unchanged as the expected impact of pricing moderation, which is reflected in effective rent growth is largely offset by the increase in projected average occupancy for the year. However, we have increased our guidance for same-store operating expense growth for the full year by 45 basis points to 6.5% at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the continued pressure in labor costs partially related to building higher occupancy. Both personnel and repair and maintenance costs are expected to moderate more as we move into 2024. While we maintained our full year guidance range for real estate taxes, we are impacted by some timing-related pressure during the fourth quarter, as some of the initial favorability related to the Texas rate reduction is essentially offset by delays in litigation related to high valuations, which is being pushed into next year. We do expect real estate taxes overall to continue moderating over the next couple of years, as we work through the changing cap rate environment. We also reduced our total overhead cost projection for the year by $2 million to $126.5 million at the midpoint and we removed our disposition expectations for the current year, to reflect the current market conditions. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Brittany, will now turn the call back to you for questions. Yeah. Thank you, John. I'm excited about the prospects for the future, but also excited about what the company is going to do over the next few quarters and years as well. Thank you. Thanks Rich. I appreciate it man."

            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad and good morning. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with sequentially higher occupancy offsetting sequentially declining new lease pricing. Increasing supply pressure did impact pricing in some of our markets resulting in a blended lease over lease pricing of 1.6% comprised of new lease rates declining 2.2% and renewal rates increasing 5%. Average physical occupancy was 95.7% resulting in revenue growth of 4.1%. The various metrics we measure related to demand remained strong. Employment markets remained stable with continued job growth across our Sunbelt markets. Net positive migration trends to our markets continue with move into our footprint well ahead of move-outs outside of our footprint and remain consistent with what we have seen in the last several quarters. Resident turnover was down once again in the third quarter a 4% decrease from prior year. Collections remained strong and consistent with prior quarters. Our new resident rent-to-income ratio remained low and in line with prior quarters and our lead volume is consistent with what we would expect and in line with pre-pandemic levels. But as mentioned, we did feel the impact of new supply in the third quarter which manifested itself in lower new lease pricing particularly beginning in August and September. This pressure was driven by higher concession uses by developers in many of our markets with the resulting reduction in net pricing in a number of our direct market comps. This peer pricing movement obviously does impact market pricing it impacts our asking rents. We believe the lingering higher interest rate environment with the 10-year treasury moving up quickly in the third quarter is driving merchant developers to get more aggressive on pricing and is creating some pockets of pricing pressure. Historically with typical seasonality pricing tends to moderate some in Q3 as compared to Q2 and then moderating quite a bit more from Q3 to Q4 typically in the 200 basis point range. While we did see a greater degree of moderation in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter with the solid demand factors mentioned previously we expect less moderation than normal from Q3 to Q4. October to date Blend and lease-over-lease pricing is zero which is within 10 basis points of what was achieved in September and a lower rate of decline than the more typical 60 basis points. Average physical occupancy for October month to date remains strong at 95.6% with exposure which is a combination of current vacancy and units on notice to vacate up 6.9% and in line with October of last year. In addition to the demand factors mentioned increased absorption through the third quarter in the Sunbelt markets provides further evidence of continued solid demand to help mitigate the impact of the continuing new deliveries. The amount of new supply that was absorbed in the third quarter in our markets was the highest it has been since the beginning of 2022. Despite the new supply pressure in some markets, our unique portfolio strategy to maintain a broad diversity of markets submarkets asset types and price points is serving us well with many of our mid-tier markets leading the portfolio and pricing performance both in the third quarter and into October. Savannah Charleston, Richmond Greenville and Raleigh are examples of markets outperforming larger metros with more new supply pressures such as Austin and Phoenix. We expect this market diversification combined with the continued strong demand fundamentals noted earlier will help continue to mitigate some of the impact of new supply as compared to a less diversified portfolio. Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 2,300 interior unit upgrades and are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative with over 92,000 units now with this technology. For our repositioning program we have five active projects that have either begun repricing or will begin repricing in the fourth quarter with expected yields in the 8% range. Additionally, we are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023 or early in 2024, with the target to complete by early 2025. That's all I had in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay. I mean I don't think it necessarily means longer. I think what did happen as we talked about it happened a little bit quicker. And I think the comments, I made about the treasury and developers get more aggressive called that moderation of new lease rates to occur a little bit earlier than we would have thought or a little bit quicker really. But we don't see much further deceleration. I think what we see is with renewal rates continuing to be strong, we're getting 5% on what we've set out or what we've got acceptance on for November and December the 5% range. The spread between new lease rates and renewal rates is pretty typical honestly, for this time of the year and tends to gap out both in Q4 and Q1. I think as you get into later into 2024, there will be some normal seasonality that will narrow that gap, but we'll be in this supply environment for the next few quarters, but don't expect materially worsening from here. At a portfolio level, we're not seeing a huge difference between the performance of As and Bs. I will say at a market level some of our larger markets that are getting more of the supply we're seeing a little more pressure on some of those B+ A- assets where that gap has narrowed. But I do think that creates some opportunity longer term. Those new developments are going to stabilize, at some point at higher rents and that will create some opportunities there. But in some of our more mid-tier markets, smaller markets that are getting quite the supply pressure we're not seeing that pressure. Hey, Eric, this is Tim. I mean I do think new lease rates probably hang in this range for a few months. Obviously, typically Q4 and Q1 are kind of weakest in terms of seasonality and the amount of traffic and all that. But I do think we will see some level of \u2013 and Eric hit on this a little bit some level of normal seasonality as we get into later to 2024. So I think as we get into March and April in the spring and the higher traffic volumes that we'll see some acceleration in those new lease rates. And I don't expect much change in renewals. We've been pretty consistent with our renewal rates going back for several years. We think those will hold up and we think the turnover rate remains low which provides the renewal side with more of that blend when you think about when the lease of our lease rates. So I think we're going to be in this range for a few months but I don't think it sticks like that for the next fall. Yes. And to clarify or put some color on that that 500 spread for us typically is what it is in the summer and kind of Q2, Q3 range with renewals remaining pretty consistent. Historically, Q4, Q1, Q4 is usually the biggest. It's usually in the 900 basis point range kind of similar to what we're seeing right now and then squeeze down to call it $700, $800 in Q1 and then get more on that 500 basis point range during the heart of the spring and summer. So, I don't really see -- that's the normal seasonality and would expect that to recurring some levels. Yes, this is Tim. So for October as I mentioned the blended is right around zero. We're at about negative 5.3 on new lease and 4.4 on renewals as we stand right now. Yes. I mean, there's certainly a few unique factors in Atlanta and what you mentioned as part of that. I mean it's pricing, pricing is a little bit weak. It's a little bit lower than I would say some of our portfolio average. There we're getting some of the supply pressure that a lot of the other markets are getting as well. I think what we're seeing in Atlanta is a little more on the occupancy side. No, it has -- it is slowly improving. We saw a 40 basis point increase in occupancy from Q2 to Q3 in Atlanta. But there are a couple of unique circumstances that you mentioned, one, if you remember earlier in the year we talked about between the winter storm and a fire we had in Atlanta. We had a lot of down units that came on sort of late first, early seconds. So we were kind of working through that from an occupancy standpoint and then, has been well documented by a lot of people at some of the fraud concerns in Atlanta. And I think that's starting to work itself through as well. The courts are becoming a little more -- a little more aggressive on that. And we've seen the number of cases [ph] that we had in that market is about double from where it was last year. So, create some pressure in the short-term on occupancy but certainly longer term, in terms of revenue quality and ability to pay is much better. And we've also been able through in-house training we've done and really focused on fraud income. We've seen the number of people coming into the door we think is with that scenario is much less and we've seen our number of age balances we have in terms of residence is way down and just the amount of delinquency we have in Atlanta is way down. So some unique circumstances there for sure, but we think it's headed in the right direction. Yes, Nick, this is Tim. So a couple of comments there. If you look at sort of where we are right now and what's going to earn in or be baked in for next year with pricing today plus the pricing that we're assuming for Q4 probably have one to 1.25 of baked in or earned in if you will that will flow into 2024. Think about loss lease and just in terms of kind of where rents are right now it's probably about a negative one of lease given what we've seen with new lease rates right now that's where I would peg it in year in October. Hey, John. This is Tim. I mean, as far as the turnover I mean, we expected -- we certainly didn't really expect to turn over to scale up with all the factors that we see at play. I mean, between move-outs by house and move-outs for a job change those are far and away our two biggest reasons for move-outs. And as expected the move out by house is way down. So we don't see that again given the interest rate environment, we don't see that changing any time near term. Some of the other things that drove move out or turnover up last year are down. So I would expect as we get into 2024 that there's not a lot of change in terms of turnover certainly no significant increase in turnover, so I think that serves us well on the renewal side, that certainly we wouldn't need to look and do anything more than we're doing now on that renewal. New lease rates for October -- is that what you're saying John? Yes. I mean Austin continues to be the worst and we've talked about that for a while. Austin is in the high negative single-digits is our worst market in terms of new lease pricing. We like I said same-store level it's right around right around 5% for October. Tampa is a little bit higher but also is the one that kind of stands out above all. I was just going to make one point that at a high level we've done some research and with some of our third-party data as you go back the last five years or so or really, really the last five or 10 years. The highest supplied markets which tend to have been in the Sunbelt have also been some of the best rate growth markets and that's because of the demand side. So we have historically over the long term demand has more than offset the supply picture. Now we have an elevated supply picture right now that's put that out of the balance at least for a temporary time. But as we get into late next year and over the long term historically has shown and we believe continue to show all the demand fundamentals show that over the long term that demand outpaces the supply. Well, I mean it's an ongoing process. I think what we've seen is that for a period from COVID up until really early this year, the counties in Atlanta specifically have been really slow to act or take any action whatsoever. So, we've seen that start to accelerate. Horton County is still a little bit of an issue, but [indiscernible] have increased their activities. So we see it starting to happen. But -- and I think we've gotten through a lot of it but it will continue over the next few months. And I think as we get into later next year, we're back into more of a normal situation in terms of Atlanta. Like I said, we've done a lot of work to make sure we're not exacerbating the problem by letting any potential fraudulent people coming in the front door. Zero is what we have dialed in for Q4 in terms of our forecast which as we said is kind of where we sit right now for October and Q1 typically compared to Q4 if I'm thinking about sort of normal environment or historical environment is usually pretty similar. I do think -- I think you could see those numbers move a little bit on the margins up or down in terms of blended that's going slightly negative or slightly positive. I do say as we get -- as I mentioned earlier as we get into the spring I think you start to see some normal seasonality in terms of new lease rates. We're not going to jump up to positive three or four all of a sudden I do think you'll see some acceleration. So there'll be some bands, but I don't think it's widely different than what you talked about because we do think renewals remain pretty consistent and with where we see turnover going that will blend in as a little bit bigger factor in terms of the overall blended rate as compared to new leases. Well, I think certainly they're aware. I mean the transparency now with what's on websites and social media and everything else and all the different marketing avenues and advertising platforms that certainly they're aware and you can see down to a unit level a lot of times on websites. But probably tell a new phenomenon. It's been that way now at least for the last couple of years. So I think there's a component of the renewal side of just you've hopefully provide them with good resident service. They're happy where they're living. They're happy with the manager and their owner. And there are some friction costs involved as well. It's pain to move, it's expensive to move. So there are some things from a customer service and a friction cost standpoint that are meaningful. But overall as we talked about I'll see turnover changing much from where it is now. So I don't think that becomes any more of an outsized pressure than it has been. I mean, it's difficult to say. I think what we have seen is certainly since COVID and post-COVID that the actions taken by the courts and the judges and that sort of thing has become a little bit more lax so that frankly creates a little bit more opportunity for bad actors. What we've done in turn is -- we've familiarized ourselves and have some experts so to speak within our team that are good at identifying that sort of thing. And frankly, what happens is if you get -- you start to get a reputation, if you will that these guys are good at catching it and the people trying to the front door that way tend to stay away. So it starts to solve itself from some standpoint, if you can be good at detecting it and good at defending it preventing it."

            "name": "Clay Holder",
            "content": "Thank you Tim and good morning. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.29 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest and overhead costs during the quarter. Overall same-store operating performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of expectations as average occupancy was better than forecasted. The increase in occupancy was offset by the moderation of effective rent growth on new move-in leases as Tim mentioned. As expected, we began to see some moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the third quarter. However, this moderation was less than what we had forecasted. Personnel costs came in higher than expected, primarily due to higher contract labor costs and higher leasing commission, which helped drive the improvements in occupancy. The personnel costs were partially offset by real estate taxes that were favorable to our forecast for the quarter. We received more information related to the Texas state legislation that was passed in the quarter that reduced property tax rates in the state. Our projection for real estate taxes for the full year remains unchanged. During the quarter, we invested a total of $19.7 million of capital through our redevelopment repositioning and smart rent installation programs. Those investments continue to produce strong returns and add to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded just over $47 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $643 million pipeline leaving $296 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new projects over the next 12 to 18 months which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains historically low with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 3.4 times, and at quarter end our debt was 100% fixed for an average of just over seven years at a low average interest rate of 3.4%. In October, we refinanced $350 million of maturing debt utilizing cash on our balance sheet and our commercial paper program. Our current plan is to continue to be patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to stabilize before refinancing. That's all I have for my prepared comments and I'll turn it over to Al to discuss Q4 guidance. We do expect that there will be some moderation in operating expenses going into next year. You saw in the report that personnel costs and repair and maintenance costs were higher than what we had expected or projected but we still do expect those to continue to moderate as we move into next year. Probably -- that will probably moderate a little bit as well as the current environment that we're seeing with high prices and valuations as those begin to kind of taper down that should work its way through the real estate taxes. And so we expect to see some moderation there as well. How fast that will play through that remains to be seen."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 27, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.\nAndrew Schaeffer : Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Leasing conditions across the MAA portfolio continued to reflect our steady employment markets, strong positive migration trends and continued low resident turnover. As a result, we are seeing good demand for apartment housing and are absorbing the new supply deliveries while supporting solid rent growth. In line with normal seasonal patterns, new lease pricing improved in the second quarter and the spread between new lease pricing and renewal pricing narrowed.  Rents for new move-in residents jumped 100 basis points higher on a sequential basis as compared to the preceding first quarter. Renewal lease pricing in the second quarter remained strong, growing by 6.8%, driving overall blended pricing performance in Q2 to 3.8%, which is ahead of the original projections we had for the year. Occupancy remains steady with average physical occupancy in the second quarter at 95.5%, which is consistent with the preceding first quarter this despite a higher number of lease expirations during the second quarter. While we are working through a higher level of new supply deliveries across our markets for the next few quarters, with the demand trends holding up as they are, we expect to continue to drive top line results that will exceed our long-term historical averages as has been the case in prior cycles of higher supply, we see the demand supply dynamic holding up slightly better in our mid-tier markets and this component of our strategy continues to bring support to overall portfolio performance during this part of the cycle. As described in our first quarter report, we do expect to see moderation in year-over-year growth in operating expenses as inflation pressures ease a bit and some of the efficiencies we expect to capture from new tech initiatives increasingly make an impact. As Al will cover in his comments, we do now also expect to see some relief on property taxes coming out of Texas, which further supports our ability to reduce our outlook for expense growth over the back half of the year. The transaction market remains quiet. We continue to underwrite a few deals, but the limited number of properties coming to market, combined with strong investor interest continues to support low cap rates and strong pricing. We continue to expect that more compelling opportunities will emerge later this year and into 2024 and believe it's important to remain patient with our balance sheet capacity.  Our new lease-up, new development and redevelopment pipelines will all continue to make solid progress and will provide attractive incremental additional earnings over the next few years. I did want to take a moment and express my deep appreciation to our on-site property teams for all their hard work and great service to our residents during these busy summer months. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen each quarter over the past year or so, second quarter transaction activity remains muted versus normal levels. Volatility and uncertainty in the debt market continued to cause the majority of sellers to postpone their sales processes, leading to a drop of more sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties in our region of the country, there continues to be strong investor demand, causing cap rates to adjust slower than interest rate movements alone would indicate. Having said that, we have seen an average buyer cap rates move up to 4.9% in the second quarter from 4.7% in the first quarter, with most cap rates ranging between 4.75% and 5.25%. We continue to believe we're likely to see more compelling acquisition opportunities later this year and into next. So we remain patient as we wait for the market to continue to adjust. We are actively reviewing a number of acquisition opportunities, but with no potential acquisitions under contract at the moment. We've lowered our acquisition forecast for the year to $200 million at the midpoint. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and now and the team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to quickly support any transaction opportunity should it materialize. Due to the lower funds needed for expected acquisitions, we've also lowered our disposition forecast for the year to $100 million at the midpoint. Our properties in their initial lease up continue to outperform our original expectations, producing higher NOIs and higher earnings and creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties are navigating the increased supply pressure well and on average, have captured in-place rents 22% above our original expectations. For the 4 properties that are either leasing or we'll start leasing in the third quarter, this retinol performance, which is partially offset by higher taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than our original expectations for these properties. Early leasing is going well at Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta, and we expect to start leasing at Novel Val Vista in Phoenix in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we also reached stabilization at MAA LoSo in Charlotte. Despite permitting and approval processes that are taking a bit longer than we anticipated, predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects. we expect 3 projects will be ready to start construction in the back half of 2023, if we see sufficient adjustments to construction costs and rents to support our NOI yield expectations. These projects include 2 in-house developments, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Denver and 1 prepurchased joint venture development in Charlotte. We've pushed back the start of the Phase 2 to our West Midtown prepurchased development in Atlanta to the 2024 due to the approval process taking longer than anticipated. The team continues to work through the increased prepurchase development opportunities that have been presented to us, and we're hopeful we will be able to add additional currently unidentified development opportunities to our pipeline. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment, reflecting the significant slowdown in new starts expected over the balance of 2023 and 2024.  Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under-construction projects, and we're doing a tremendous managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures as well as labor constraints on our development costs and schedules. During the quarter, the team successfully completed and accepted delivery of the combined 249 units and Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with stable occupancy low resident turnover and better blended rent performance than what we previously projected. Despite increasing supply pressure in some of our markets, blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.8% comprised of new lease growth of 0.5% and renewal growth of 6.8% was better than our forecasted expectations. While occupancy was slightly below our expected range for the quarter, the resulting higher blended lease growth performance is a favorable trade-off providing a greater future compounding growth effect. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show a typical seasonality that is to accelerate from the first quarter and renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 to moderate some, but still provide the catalyst to strong second quarter pricing performance. As Eric mentioned, this played out as expected with new lease pricing accelerating 100 basis points as compared to the first quarter and renewal pricing remaining strong. Alongside the pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained consistent with the first quarter at 95.5%, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 8.1%. The various demand factors we monitor remained strong in the second quarter with 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units would notice to vacate over the next 60 days, largely consistent with prior year at 8.5% versus 8.4% in the second quarter of last year. Furthermore, Quarterly resident turnover was down almost 2% from the prior year. Move-ins from markets outside of our footprint ticked up slightly from Q1 to 13% and rent to income ticked down slightly from Q1 to 22%. The employment market remains relatively strong also, particularly in the Sunbelt markets. While lead volume trailed the record demand scenarios we saw in 2021 and 2022, it is up from 2018 and 2019. And last years where we experienced a more normal demand curve.  Our prospect engagement platform that combines AI, marketing automation and scheduled human engagement has enabled us to engage with prospects more effectively. July to date, pricing remains ahead of our original expectations with blended pricing of 3.2%. This is comprised of new lease pricing of 0.3% and renewal pricing of 5.5%. The new lease pricing is relatively consistent with the 0.5% for the second quarter and within 5 basis points of June new lease pricing. As expected, renewal pricing is moderating to a more normal range as leases are beginning to expire that were signed in the period last year when renewal rents had caught up to new lease rents. Physical occupancy is currently 95.6% with average daily occupancy for July month to date of 95.3%. The current July occupancy and July exposure, which is even with the prior year, 7.5%, puts us in a good position for the remainder of the quarter. A key part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points.  As we compete with elevated supply deliveries, particularly in some of our larger markets, many of our mid-tier markets are performing well and leading the portfolio and pricing performance, both in the second quarter and into July. Savannah, Charleston, Richmond, Kansas City, Greenville and Raleigh are all outperforming the overall portfolio. We expect that this market diversification, combined with continued strong demand fundamentals will help mitigate the impact of new supply that we expect to be elevated over the next several quarters. Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the second quarter. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of Smart Home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the second quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 1,900 interior unit upgrades and installed nearly 2,300 Smart Home packages.  We are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative and now have over 92,000 units with this technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 15 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 5 projects that will begin repricing in the third quarter and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Al.\nAl Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter, $2.28 per share was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest in overhead costs during the quarter, and a large portion of the overhead cost favorability is timing related with the cost now expected to be incurred in the back half of the year. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, blended lease pricing continues to outperform original expectations for the year and build stronger-than-expected longer-term revenue but was primarily offset in the second quarter by average occupancy slightly below forecast. Also, as expected, we began to see moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the second quarter with the growth of personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate expenses, tax expenses, excuse me, which combined represents 70% of total operating costs, all reflecting moderation from the prior quarter. We expect moderation for these items to continue through the remainder of the year, particularly for real estate taxes, which we'll discuss more with guidance in just a moment.  As mentioned in the release, our annual property and casualty insurance programs renewed on July 1, and with combined premium increase of approximately 20%, which is in line with our prior guidance. During the quarter, we invested a total of $26.3 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart reinstallation programs producing strong returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio.  We also funded just over $51 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $735 million pipeline, leaving $344 million remaining to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new deals over the next 12 to 18 months, likely expanding our development pipeline to be closer to $1 billion, which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant safety and future opportunity. Our leverage remains historically low, the debt-to-EBITDA at 3.4x, and our debt is currently 100% fixed for an average of 7.5 years at a record low 3.4%. We do have $350 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter but our current plan is to remain patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next few quarters before refinancing with long-term debt.  And finally, given the second quarter's earnings performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising our core FFO and several other areas of our guidance previously provided. With the blended pricing outperformance achieved through the second quarter, we are increasing the midpoint of our effective rent growth guidance to 7.4%, a 25 basis points increase. This is offset by a decrease in our physical occupancy guidance, which is now projected to average 95.5% for the full year, a 30 basis points decrease. Though this trade-off support slightly higher rental earning going forward, our total revenue growth guidance for this year remains unchanged at the midpoint of 6.25%.  In early July, the Texas state legislature passed the tax overhaul which significantly rolled back property tax rates across the state to effectively redistribute a budget surplus. Given aggressive property valuations, we had previously anticipated rate rollbacks in Texas, where we have now added a specific reduction for this legislation, which lowers our overall same-store real estate tax growth rate for the year by 50 basis points to 5.5% at the midpoint and that's $0.02 per share to core FFO for the year. There's still limited information regarding exactly how individual counties and municipalities will push this change through but our guidance now includes our early estimate of this overall impact, which is expected to be ongoing. In summary, we are increasing our core FFO projections for the full year to a midpoint of $9.14 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share. This increase is primarily comprised of a carry-through of $0.01 per share from the second quarter performance -- outperformance as well as the $0.02 per share addition related to the Texas legislation. As Brad mentioned, we also revised our transaction volume expectations for the current year to reflect current market conditions. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Aaron, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Apologies if I missed this in your remarks, but could you just tell us the blended rent growth you're expecting sort of for the full year now, that's been revised upward and then what that would be in the back half of the year as well?\nAl Campbell: Yes, Eric, this is Al. We had started the year, if you remember, with 3% for the full year, but the outperformance we've seen through the first half, that's increased that. So I think for the full year, we didn't put that in our guidance. But if you do the math on it, it's about 3.5% for this year. And that means largely sticking to the 3% for most of the back half, though we started in July, as Tim talked about stronger than that. So you're probably averaging 3.1%, 3.2% for the back half and that projection now.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. Makes sense. And then you mentioned that new lease rates did come up as you expected in the second quarter, as you would expect, seasonally but there's still a pretty wide gap between new lease and renewal rate growth. So I was just trying to understand what your sort of expectation would be for new lease growth in the back half of the year? And then thinking through whether that's actually a good sort of proxy for market rent growth should the 2 kind of be around the same?\nTim Argo: Eric, this is Tim. With new lease growth, we did, as you said, we saw it accelerate some as we expected. It didn't accelerate quite as much as what we would see in a normal environment. I do think there's a little bit of supply pressure impact on that. Having said that, I don't really expect it to decelerate as much as it normally might would in Q3. It's typically kind of around this time that you start seeing new lease pricing moderate a little bit as demand starts to moderate some. So I don't expect the volatility, if you will, to be quite as large on the new lease side. On the renewal side, we talked about it from the beginning of the year, there was a sort of unusual scenario last year where for the first, call it, 7, 8 months of 2022, new lease pricing outpaced renewal pricing quite a bit. So we knew we had some opportunity kind of mark-to-market those that were on the renewal rates as the first part of last year. So we've kind of reached a point where we're lapping those and starting to reprice those. That's where you've seen the renewal pricing moderate a little bit, but we still expect it to be quite a bit stronger than new lease rates, which is typical and really just kind of returning to a normal seasonality scenario.\nOperator: And we will go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman : Great. I appreciate your comments on mid-tier markets outperforming the entire portfolio. Can you talk more about A versus B and how those are performing within your market?\nTim Argo: Yes. This is Tim. It's -- the Bs are still outperforming a little bit. I would call it kind of a 40 to 50 basis point gap between what -- how we would define As versus Bs, and that's pretty consistent on the new lease side and the renewal side. So I think it's as part of the portfolio structure that we expect those markets that can be more of the B assets perform well and some of the supply or in most markets, the supply coming in, hasn't been quite as impactful on some of the more B assets. They've typically been much higher price, more urban-style assets and at a much higher rent than particularly some of the B assets.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. And then in the press release, you talked about demand kind of maybe even better than your initial expectations and mitigating some of the supply risks. Can you give more color or maybe put some numbers around that? Maybe I don't know if you've looked in that detail, but like what percentage of job growth, do you need to mitigate that supply risk? Just more color on what gives you confidence in making that statement and what you're seeing.\nTim Argo: Yes. So there's a few things that we typically look at as a leading indicator of demand. You obviously have job growth at a macro level, which continues to be pretty strong and certainly stronger in a lot of the Sunbelt markets and then more granularly, we look at exposure, lead volume, what we call lead per exposed unit, which is really a combination of those 2 metrics and then also looking at what our renewal accept rates are. So on lead volume and leads for exposed, it's not at the level it was in '22, which was record demand. But as I noted in the comments, you go back to kind of the 2018, 2019 time frame when we saw more normal, if you will, demand scenario, we have -- our lead volume leads per exposed is quite a bit higher than those times. So that's encouraging that our renewal accept rates remained strong and higher to that period as well. We have 60% accept rate for July, 58% for August and 43% for September, which is at or above where we would expect or we would like to see it. And then a couple of other metrics, rent-to-income continues to stay consistent, stay lower, actually dropped a little bit from what it was in Q1, turnover remains low and reasons people moving out to buy house is way down. So all of those various factors, while not quite at the level we've seen with the record performance last year, still healthy and stronger than typical year, if you will.\nEric Bolton: And Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim just said, which covers a lot of reasons why we see the demand staying healthy. The other thing it's just a continued positive migration trends, 13% of the leases that we wrote in Q2 were for people moving into the Sunbelt for the first time. And that compares to 15%, 16% during the peak of COVID. So while it's moderated, it's moderated just a little bit, and it's still well above where it was before COVID had started. So these positive migration trends are still there. Any thought of some kind of reversal after COVID was over. I think we've dispelled that fear at this point. So there's just a multitude of factors that sort of go into it, and we're pleased with where we see demand continuing to hold up.\nJamie Feldman : Okay. That's very helpful color. And then finally for me, your comments about expenses moderating into the back half of the year, certainly encouraging. As you think about '24 and the key line items, do you have a sense like do you think all of them will be down in terms of your expense growth rate?\nAl Campbell: I think as you talk about, I mean, too early to really get to a refinement '24, but certainly, we would expect some continued moderation, just some of the inflationary pressures begin to weighing. The 3 main areas, obviously, the personal repair, maintenance and taxes. Taxes, I would say, being the biggest, certainly it's going to follow the moderations of the top line. So it's a backward-looking thing. So you would naturally think that as '24 looking back to '23, which is a good year, but a more moderate year than it was in '22 that you should see some moderation there. So probably in those 3 that make up 70% of our expenses, you'll see some moderation at some level.\nJamie Feldman : Any ballpark?\nAl Campbell: Hard to ballpark at this point. I don't think it would be probably a long-term rate, but somewhere between we are today and that.\nOperator: And we will move then to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt : I'm just curious if you're finding that you're having to trade off some of that new growth to drive traffic or sustain occupancy in the 95.5% level. It seemed like July occupancy dipped from we were tracking. And I'm just ongoing kind of think through as sort of seasonal demands lows and supply picks up, does that concern as you move to the latter part of the year and heading into '24?\nTim Argo: Also, this is Tim. On the occupancy front, we've kind of -- we've been hanging in that 95.5% range for really all of the first half of the year, which we've been comfortable with, as we mentioned, with pricing being a little bit better than we thought. So we're willing to make that trade-off with the compounding growth we can get from rents. As we moved into July, I can see it moderated a little bit. There is some unique circumstances in Atlanta that we can talk about that's driving that down a little bit, if you kind of pull Atlanta out of that number, we'd be right back to 95.5% on occupancy, which we're comfortable being in that range. So it hasn't it hasn't moved the needle. I don't think I'm a new lease rate a little bit. I mean there is some supply pressure that we've talked about. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything specifically tied to occupancy necessarily.\nEric Bolton: And Austin, I'll also add a couple of points on that. The thing to keep in mind is we have a pretty extensive sort of redevelopment and some of the new technology initiatives that we're particularly smart home initiative, that continues to fuel the opportunity for positioning the portfolio at a higher rent level, particularly as it compares to some of the new supply coming into the market. One of the benefits of the supply coming to the market, particularly when it's coming into the market on average 20% higher than the rents that we're charging, it creates a more compelling value play for our portfolio to the rental market.  And so that's working to give us some momentum on the rent growth that we might otherwise not have both of those things. And then -- the -- so I would just tell you -- and the other thing that I would tell you is we track pretty actively why people leave us. And when you look at move-outs that are occurring because people don't want to pay the rent increase, has ticked down a little bit from where it was last year as a percent of our turnover, but it's still running higher than it has long term. And as Tim says, we're okay with that trade-off for a slightly lower proxy right now because that revenue growth associated with rents is really much more impactful in terms of compounding value over the long term. So we sort of like where we are right now and continue with this sort of trying to manage that tension between pricing and occupancy where it is right now.\nAustin Wurschmidt : Got it. No, that's helpful. It sounds like that occupancy and maybe even some of the frictional vacancy is like redevelopment was picking up a little bit from where you had originally expected. Second question, when you look across some of your larger markets, obviously, new lease growth is modestly positive. But when you kind of look across the large markets where you're feeling some of the supply pressure more acutely, are there any that are notable gain to lease today that you'd kind of highlight that we should be a little bit more focused on moving forward?\nTim Argo: Austin, it's Tim. When you say Gain to lease, meaning where there's \u2026\nAustin Wurschmidt : A couple of months are noticeably above market rents. Yes.\nTim Argo: Not -- I wouldn't say anything significant. Even -- we do have some negative new lease rates on a couple of those larger markets, but none of them are getting to out about, I mean they're kind of in that negative 1%, 5% range. So it's not a huge, huge variance in what we're seeing overall. So nothing significant that I would point out.\nAustin Wurschmidt : Or those that are at that kind of negative 1%-ish range?\nTim Argo: So you've got -- I would point out Austin is, 1 that's been a little softer also in Phoenix, and we've talked about those 2 markets here for a while are kind of the 2 that I would point out that have been our weaker performers and certainly have some supply impact. It's great about the long term, obviously, we have great demand fundamentals, but those have been 2 that probably lead the list in terms of our higher concentration markets.\nOperator: We will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern : For some of the markets that are lagging their normal seasonal trends, like you obviously just mentioned Austin and Phoenix but some of the other ones as well. Do you think that that's entirely due to elevated supply? Or are there any other factors that you would call out that might be driving that?\nTim Argo: No, I don't think it's primarily supply. I mean, supply is somewhat widespread across several of the larger markets in particular. And then it's nuanced to by market, obviously, and depending on where our portfolio is relative to some others. I mean, Charlotte is a good example. It's getting high level of supply, similar to some of these other markets, but it's performed well, and it's just kind of where our portfolio is positioned versus where the supply is coming in. So generally, I'd say supply, again, going back to the demand side. If you look at job growth across our markets compared to national averages, we're pretty consistently higher than average across all those markets. So there's obviously nuances by market but nothing notable outside of that.\nBrad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then on the balance sheet, obviously, you've been setting record low leverage numbers every quarter for a while now. What do you think the likelihood is that we'll see these sub-4x numbers stick around for the long term? Or I guess, what are the circumstances where you would potentially take leverage back up to a more normal level?\nAl Campbell: So Brad, this is Al. And we've talked about for, I think, several quarters now. Certainly, we love the strength of our balance sheet, but our leverage is really below where we want long term at this point. We've been patient to allow opportunities come to us. So in our credit rating at A minus, 4.5 would be something you could be very confident so we're a full turn below that right now. So significant opportunity there, but willing to be patient to allow Brad to find the right investments.\nEric Bolton: And we do think that as we get later in this year and particularly into 2024, that we are seeing early indications that would suggest that opportunities are going to start to pick up. As Brad alluded to, we have seen cap rates moved just a tad on a sequential basis quarter-to-quarter. And we're talking -- he and his team are talking to another -- a number of merchant builders right now about some opportunities. So we continue to feel confident and comfortable that more opportunity is around the corner.\nOperator: And we will move next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: In response to an earlier question in the Q&A, you talked about new lease not accelerating as much as you expected. Does that mean that new leases have the rent growth has peaked earlier in the season than it had in the past? And then the second part of that question talked about you don't expect it to decelerate as quickly, why is that?\nTim Argo: Well, one nuance there. The new lease pricing has done what we expected. It didn't decelerate or it didn't accelerate less than we expected. It accelerated a little bit less than what we've seen in the last couple of years, but in line with, if not slightly better than expectations. And so what we've seen is new lease pricing accelerate, just not quite as much as it may do in a lower supplied environment. So I think at the same time, given all the fundamentals we're seeing and the various metrics we talked about earlier, don't quite expect that new lease rate to drop off quite as much as it might normally for kind of the same reason been accelerated as much. So that's kind of how we see it playing out. But really have been as if not better than expected.\nMichael Goldsmith: And then as a follow-up, there's a lot of new supply coming in your markets, tenants or potential tenants have a lot of options to choose from. Are you seeing a longer time for tenants to make a decision? Or maybe like between your traffic to visit and the time between that and when they sign our conversion rates being low. What are you seeing in the trends there? What are you seeing in the trends from that perspective?\nTim Argo: Not really anything, Michael. It's probably taken a little bit longer for us to get an answer on the renewal side, but ultimately, as I mentioned, our renewal accept rates are better than they were a couple of years ago in a similar environment and kind of where we expect to see them. Our conversion rates are in line with period as well. So nothing notable other than -- I mentioned the leads are down a little bit from what we saw last year, but we would have expected that with the growth we saw last year.\nOperator: And we will go next to Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlex Goldfarb : So just trying to put a bow on the supply. It's obviously been a big topic. If I hear correctly from what you're saying, it sounds like it's really only Phoenix and Austin where it's really an issue. Atlanta has maybe as another market, just given the occupancy dip that you talked about. But otherwise, the balance of your portfolio, it sounds like yes, there's supply, but it's not really competitive with you guys. You feel comfortable with the in-migration, the economic growth, the job growth to be comfortable with your rents. So is that sort of the main takeaway that the supply is really limited to maybe 2 or 3 markets for you guys, and that's it. All the other markets are fine. I just sort of want to encapsulate this.\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean also an advantage of the 2 that are the worst. I mean I wouldn't say we only have 2 or 3 that are feeling any supply impacts. I mean I think it is impacting several of our markets at some level. But what we've always talked about is with the demand being there, supply just sort of moderate things. It doesn't put a ditch. It says shocks on the demand side that really send rate growth negative for extended period of time, and we're not seeing that. So I mean I -- like I said, I wouldn't say there's only 2 we're feeling some supply pressure, but those are the most notable. But otherwise, demand is doing a pretty good job of mitigating things.\nAlex Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is your guidance for the second quarter is rather wide. And I'm assuming you guys are pretty conservative route, but [$2.18] on the low side, just low, obviously. So should we expect a decline quarter-to-quarter? Or are there some oddball things that could come up that would drive like I'm just trying to think why would FFO go down? And maybe you'll say, hey, it's a onetime item. There's some sort of tax impact or returns or something like that, that we're going to see.\nAl Campbell: Alex, this is Al. I think, you see in the second and third quarter often, some things that are below same-store NOI, whether it be overhead, whether it be -- so just some items that are more -- that are not in your operating costs. And so second and third quarter, they tend to be chunky. What we're seeing is some of those costs we talked about that we outperformed in the second quarter on G&A. But that would be timing lag. Some of that's going to come back to us seeing some of that in the third quarter, which expects that a little bit. So nothing unusual. You see that second and third quarter be a little volatile, but the important point is just the projection for the year, continued strength.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico : Tim, just going back to Atlanta. I know last quarter, you talked about some weather issues affecting occupancy. Was there anything else driving the occupancy being lower there this quarter?\nTim Argo: Yes. A couple of things going there. I mean Atlanta is experiencing a decent amount of supply. It's not quite as high as some of our other markets, but relative to what Atlanta typically gets there. There is some supply pressure. But a couple of other things impacting that. You mentioned one of them. We had sort of late first quarter, early second quarter over the course of 2 or 3 months. We had about 100 units come back online in Atlanta, which was a mixture of some units that were down to storm damage and then a fire at one of our properties. And so pulling those back into the portfolio and meaning to lease those up had some impacts. And then secondly, which is hinders us a little bit in the short term, but is positive on the long term is Atlanta and the counties there have started to progress some on evictions and filings and doing court dates and kind of working through that whole process, which has been a real laggard in terms of our markets for working through that. So we actually year-to-date have seen about 140 more [Indiscernible] and skips this time versus the same period last year. So a good thing, as I said, long term, and we are seeing a little bit better payment progress there, but it kind of doubled down on some of the occupancy pressure there. Revenue and pricing has held in okay. It's a little bit below the market, but not are a little bit below the portfolio but not too bad. And overall, we obviously still feel good about it long term, but just running through a little bit of pressure right now.\nNick Yulico : Okay. And then in terms of -- if we think about new supply and concessions being offered across markets. Can you just give a feel for where concessions are more prevalent, competing product and where you're also offering concessions in the existing assets or in any of the development assets?\nTim Argo: Yes. So for our portfolio, concessions are running about -- cash concessions are about 0.5% of rents. It's ticked up a little bit, but not significantly. I mean we do tend to net price with our pricing systems who don't use a ton of concessions. But broadly, at a market level and what we're seeing some of the competitors. I would say you're at a month free is about where we're at in several of the larger markets. And for most, that is more kind of in-town central areas of the markets, you might see a little bit more if there's a lease up in the area, but we're not seeing any more than a month and a half or so in any of our markets. Austin is one where it's a little unique in that we're actually not seeing a lot of concessions kind of in the Central Austin but more in the suburbs where there's quite a bit of supply. That's one where concessions are a little more prevalent in the suburbs versus other markets where it's more urban and fill.\nBrad Hill: Sorry, I just want to add to that real quick. You asked about our lease-up properties. To Tim's point, we've got 1 in lease-up in Austin. That one, we're offering up to a month free, which is on select units, by the way, not across the board. We've got a couple of hundred units competing supply just in that same submarket. So I'd say that one is probably feeling the most pressure. But I will say that average rents on that property are a couple $300 to $400 higher than what we expected. And then the average concession usage there is significantly below what we expected. Most of our new lease-ups, we expect about a month free, and we've been significantly [indiscernible] that on this asset. And then I would just say, all of our properties that are in lease-up right now, we're below what we generally pro forma, which is a month free, just we're offering that on select units as needed. So it's not broad-based use of concessions that we're seeing right now.\nNick Yulico : Great. If I could just follow up on the investment activity and being more patient there. I know you gave some commentary on this. But is that more of a view that, hey, cap rates seem like they're too low to where you're penciling they should make sense? Or is it also just a view that, hey, at some point, we're not sure exactly where market rents are going in some areas, there is supply coming. Maybe there's an opportunity to wait. You mentioned talking to merchant developers and just trying to kind of tie together, I guess, valuation versus a view on, hey, fundamentals are becoming a little bit uncertain because of supply.\nBrad Hill: Right. Nick, this is Brad. I would say it's really the belief that we think cap rates will tick up a bit from where they are right now. I mean the fundamentals generally are holding up pretty well within our region of the country, and we're not seeing distress certainly in our region and especially in these lease-up properties. We've seen cap rates tick up over the last year, 1.5 years and really what we believe right now with the limited amount of inventory that's on the market, the capital that's out there kind of piling up on each other on the assets that are coming to market. So that is driving down cap rates. We also continue to see a high proportion of the deals that do trade or 10.31 exchange as well as loan assumptions.  So we just believe that as the elevated supply that's occurred in our market over the last year, 2 years, begins to come to market. Those assets need to trade, merchant developers need to sell and as that product comes to market, it's likely to spread out the capital a bit and we're likely to see cap rates continue to move up a bit from where they are today. Today, interest rates are 5.5%, 5.75%. And I think when you layer on to that, just still good operating fundamentals, but not the 5%, 6%, 7% rent growth that we've seen over the last year.  I do think that, that continues to point to a scenario where the negative leverage continues to decrease, which supports increasing cap rates. So just for context, after the GFC, 3-year period after that, we purchased 9,000 units over a 3-year period. And I don't know if this situation will be as fruitful as that was for us, but it certainly feels like our region is really primarily driven by merchant developers and product needs to trade at some point, and we're starting to see cap rates move up a bit. So we're going to be patient and hold our capacity to what we think will be a better opportunity.\nOperator: And we will move next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim : I wanted to ask about your same-store revenue guidance. You narrowed the range, but you maintained the midpoint. But you started the year with 5.5% earn-in. So just to hit the top end of your same-store revenue guidance of 7%. You only really needed to achieve 3% lease growth rates for the year. You've already exceeded that. I think you've been saying that lease growth rates have come in higher than expected. So I know that occupancy offsets this a little bit, same with the fees, but your 6.25% midpoint seems very conservative today. I just wanted your response on this.\nAl Campbell: John, this is Al. I think the important point there, we didn't cover today, we've talked about it a bit in the past is that there is a little bit of dilution in that total revenue from the pricing line because there's other income components that are about 10% of our revenue stream that aren't growing, if they call it 7%. And so they're going 2% to 3%. And so that dilutes it some. So that's probably the difference there. But in general, the math that you laid out was the 5.5% carry in plus half of the pricing performance we've gotten this year, which is we've talked about was 3% -- 3.5% blended pricing, half of that. That gives you pretty close to the effective rent growth expectation we have this year and then those other income items dilute that just a bit.\nJohn Kim : So is there a likelihood that you're going to achieve above the midpoint of your guidance?\nAl Campbell: I'm just saying that the guidance is -- we think the guidance is accurate. There are things other than effective rents that are affecting that total revenue, John. There's items that are other income related that are growing call it, 2% to 3% that bring that down. So if you're looking at total revenue, I think the -- we brought it in just because we narrowed it, which we typically do, just because we have a little more information getting closer to the end of the year, but that midpoint of 6.25% in total revenue, we still feel that's the right number.\nJohn Kim : Okay. My second question is on the insurance premium that you got 20%. I know that's in line with your guidance, but it still came in probably lower than many of us had expected. And I'm wondering if there was any change in the coverage that you had to get that premium, whether it's self-insuring or reduced coverage or anything else?\nRob DelPriore: Yes, John, this is Rob. Yes, in part, the cost -- the property insurance premium is a big driver of it. It was up about 33%, and that was offset by a much smaller increase in our casualty lines, automobile workers' comp, general liability. So the balance result, as you said, was about 20%. We did have some changes on the retentions this year, about $1 million on our per occurrence and a couple of million dollars on our aggregate then we do have a separate freeze event deductible because of some of the events that were happening in the Southeast. But overall, we feel like the retentions that we have are appropriate given the balance sheet strength we have and the spread of risk across the portfolio, given the geographic disbursement. And then as we've done for several years, we did take a portion of the primary insurance that we've got about $10 milllion of self-retention there that we feel very comfortable with, with an insurance product that caps our loss over 3 years at $15million or so. So I feel like we're in really good shape there relative to the strength of the balance sheet.\nOperator: And we will move next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski : Brad or Eric, I just had a follow-up question regarding the glimpses and signs of better acquisition opportunities you're starting to see. Can you just give me a sense for whether you're seeing notable signs and broad-based sign of capitulation on pricing from merchant builders struggling with higher debt service costs on their lease ups?\nBrad Hill: Yes, John, this is Brad. Yes, I would say we're not seeing capitulation at this point. I think what we're seeing is selectively developers are looking to take some risk off the table on select assets when it makes sense for them to do so. I mean just for context in the first quarter, we track, I think, 7 deals that we had data points on. We're up to, call it, 14 in the second quarter. But I would also say the majority of those are not necessarily merchant developed assets. So again, not a lot of data points there. We've seen a few but not broad-based. I do think that, that is what we continue to monitor because as we get later into this year, to my comments earlier, I think the merchant developer profile and need to transact increases. But we haven't seen that really open up broadly at the moment.\nEric Bolton: And John, I would tell you, as you get later in the year and you get into the slower leasing season sort of during the holidays and Q1 of next year, a lot of these lease-ups are going to see more pressure. Just leasing traffic is not as robust during that time of the year. And so we do think that we're heading into an environment where more likely than not pressure will build for some of the lease-up projects that are happening out there, and that may trigger some opportunity.\nJohn Pawlowski : Okay. Makes sense. Final question for me. Tim, you talked about the mid-tier markets outperforming over coming quarters. Could you just give us a sense a rough range of the blended rent spreads you expect in your mid-tier markets over the second half of this year versus the more supply lead in larger metros?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, it obviously varies by market. There are some doing much better than others. But I would say and depending on what -- which market you divide in mid-tier versus not, you're probably somewhere in 100 to 150 basis point blended spread. So year-to-date, we're seeing several that are in that 4.5% to 5% range compared to our upper 3s overall portfolio. So I do think 100 to 200 basis points spread is probably about right.\nOperator: And we will move next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.\nRob Stevenson : I know you have quite a lot of data on your residents. Do you have the data on the percentage of residents with student loans outstanding? And what do you think the resumption of payments is going to have impact wise on ability to pass-through future rent increases in '24?\nTim Argo: Yes, Rob, this is Tim. We talked about that a little bit. We do not have insight into that. We outsource sort of our credit check and income verification. So we don't have insight into that, certainly at any broad level and actually as part of income qualification and rent-to-income checks, you're not allowed to use student debt as part of that. So really don't have much insight into that, to be honest.\nRob Stevenson : Okay. And then, Al, how are you reading Texas in terms of this property taxes going forward? Is this just a onetime distribution of the surplus? Or are you expecting to see fundamental changes there and lower levels of property taxes in Texas going forward?\nAl Campbell: No, Rob, we would read this at some level, it should be an ongoing benefit. I mean every -- what we've seen over the last several years is Texas because of the strength of the state has had really high valuations come out, property valuations. And we've seen millage rate rollbacks some more than others in different municipalities because of that because there is some limitation at the revenue level and budgetary level on taxes they can do. So we had projected a rate rollback. Now this because the overall budget surplus goes well beyond that. And so they basically recognizing that the [indiscernible] are full, recognizing that the state is doing very well, but valuations overall are very strong. So they're permanently reducing that rate, if you would, by legislation. Now the other side of that is in the future, if the economy in Texas is different, they could undo it. But this should be a permanent ongoing impact that's pretty significant. I mean it caps out to be something like $0.20 per $100 of value for your property values, and that's pretty significant.\nRob Stevenson : And any other markets where you're seeing property taxes trending above or below your expectations from earlier this year?\nAl Campbell: Not really. I think the one outstanding to really get the final information on other than Texas is Florida. It's the one that comes in late. And so we need to see the millage rates there. We've got the values. We need to see the millage rates coming in like a pretty significant. But other than that, getting a pretty clear picture at this point. We're about 70% of the knowledge at this point, I would say, Rob.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.\nAnthony Powell : Just wanted to walk through maybe the medium-term outlook for lease spreads. It sounds like you expect new lease spreads to be in the 0% to 1% range for the next couple of quarters. Is that renewals go to 0% to 1% maybe early next year as well? Or kind of remain above new for a while?\nTim Argo: Yes. I think I would expect renewals to remain above new, and that's not unusual. I mean, what we saw last year where new lease rates were quite a bit higher than renewals is more the exception than the norm. And so with renewals, you've got obviously, somebody that has lived with you and hopefully you provided good resident service and have an asset that they enjoy living in, and so there's some friction costs to move and all that. So typically, we would see renewals pretty consistently above new leases. So I don't expect it to get down to the new lease level.\nAnthony Powell : Got it. And can you remind us what's your peak level of supply delivery on a quarterly basis? Is it first half of next year? And just when do you think supply starts to come down in your market?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean it's difficult to nail down to a quarter, but I think our belief right now is kind of peaking early 2024 and then starting to trend down and then really set up for a good position as we get into 2025 in terms of lower deliveries.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'll hand the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton : We appreciate everyone joining us this morning and obviously follow up with any other questions that you may have. And that's all we have this morning. So thank you for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Leasing conditions across the MAA portfolio continued to reflect our steady employment markets, strong positive migration trends and continued low resident turnover. As a result, we are seeing good demand for apartment housing and are absorbing the new supply deliveries while supporting solid rent growth. In line with normal seasonal patterns, new lease pricing improved in the second quarter and the spread between new lease pricing and renewal pricing narrowed.  Rents for new move-in residents jumped 100 basis points higher on a sequential basis as compared to the preceding first quarter. Renewal lease pricing in the second quarter remained strong, growing by 6.8%, driving overall blended pricing performance in Q2 to 3.8%, which is ahead of the original projections we had for the year. Occupancy remains steady with average physical occupancy in the second quarter at 95.5%, which is consistent with the preceding first quarter this despite a higher number of lease expirations during the second quarter. While we are working through a higher level of new supply deliveries across our markets for the next few quarters, with the demand trends holding up as they are, we expect to continue to drive top line results that will exceed our long-term historical averages as has been the case in prior cycles of higher supply, we see the demand supply dynamic holding up slightly better in our mid-tier markets and this component of our strategy continues to bring support to overall portfolio performance during this part of the cycle. As described in our first quarter report, we do expect to see moderation in year-over-year growth in operating expenses as inflation pressures ease a bit and some of the efficiencies we expect to capture from new tech initiatives increasingly make an impact. As Al will cover in his comments, we do now also expect to see some relief on property taxes coming out of Texas, which further supports our ability to reduce our outlook for expense growth over the back half of the year. The transaction market remains quiet. We continue to underwrite a few deals, but the limited number of properties coming to market, combined with strong investor interest continues to support low cap rates and strong pricing. We continue to expect that more compelling opportunities will emerge later this year and into 2024 and believe it's important to remain patient with our balance sheet capacity.  Our new lease-up, new development and redevelopment pipelines will all continue to make solid progress and will provide attractive incremental additional earnings over the next few years. I did want to take a moment and express my deep appreciation to our on-site property teams for all their hard work and great service to our residents during these busy summer months. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad. And Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim just said, which covers a lot of reasons why we see the demand staying healthy. The other thing it's just a continued positive migration trends, 13% of the leases that we wrote in Q2 were for people moving into the Sunbelt for the first time. And that compares to 15%, 16% during the peak of COVID. So while it's moderated, it's moderated just a little bit, and it's still well above where it was before COVID had started. So these positive migration trends are still there. Any thought of some kind of reversal after COVID was over. I think we've dispelled that fear at this point. So there's just a multitude of factors that sort of go into it, and we're pleased with where we see demand continuing to hold up. And Austin, I'll also add a couple of points on that. The thing to keep in mind is we have a pretty extensive sort of redevelopment and some of the new technology initiatives that we're particularly smart home initiative, that continues to fuel the opportunity for positioning the portfolio at a higher rent level, particularly as it compares to some of the new supply coming into the market. One of the benefits of the supply coming to the market, particularly when it's coming into the market on average 20% higher than the rents that we're charging, it creates a more compelling value play for our portfolio to the rental market.  And so that's working to give us some momentum on the rent growth that we might otherwise not have both of those things. And then -- the -- so I would just tell you -- and the other thing that I would tell you is we track pretty actively why people leave us. And when you look at move-outs that are occurring because people don't want to pay the rent increase, has ticked down a little bit from where it was last year as a percent of our turnover, but it's still running higher than it has long term. And as Tim says, we're okay with that trade-off for a slightly lower proxy right now because that revenue growth associated with rents is really much more impactful in terms of compounding value over the long term. So we sort of like where we are right now and continue with this sort of trying to manage that tension between pricing and occupancy where it is right now. And we do think that as we get later in this year and particularly into 2024, that we are seeing early indications that would suggest that opportunities are going to start to pick up. As Brad alluded to, we have seen cap rates moved just a tad on a sequential basis quarter-to-quarter. And we're talking -- he and his team are talking to another -- a number of merchant builders right now about some opportunities. So we continue to feel confident and comfortable that more opportunity is around the corner. And John, I would tell you, as you get later in the year and you get into the slower leasing season sort of during the holidays and Q1 of next year, a lot of these lease-ups are going to see more pressure. Just leasing traffic is not as robust during that time of the year. And so we do think that we're heading into an environment where more likely than not pressure will build for some of the lease-up projects that are happening out there, and that may trigger some opportunity. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning and obviously follow up with any other questions that you may have. And that's all we have this morning. So thank you for joining us."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen each quarter over the past year or so, second quarter transaction activity remains muted versus normal levels. Volatility and uncertainty in the debt market continued to cause the majority of sellers to postpone their sales processes, leading to a drop of more sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties in our region of the country, there continues to be strong investor demand, causing cap rates to adjust slower than interest rate movements alone would indicate. Having said that, we have seen an average buyer cap rates move up to 4.9% in the second quarter from 4.7% in the first quarter, with most cap rates ranging between 4.75% and 5.25%. We continue to believe we're likely to see more compelling acquisition opportunities later this year and into next. So we remain patient as we wait for the market to continue to adjust. We are actively reviewing a number of acquisition opportunities, but with no potential acquisitions under contract at the moment. We've lowered our acquisition forecast for the year to $200 million at the midpoint. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and now and the team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to quickly support any transaction opportunity should it materialize. Due to the lower funds needed for expected acquisitions, we've also lowered our disposition forecast for the year to $100 million at the midpoint. Our properties in their initial lease up continue to outperform our original expectations, producing higher NOIs and higher earnings and creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties are navigating the increased supply pressure well and on average, have captured in-place rents 22% above our original expectations. For the 4 properties that are either leasing or we'll start leasing in the third quarter, this retinol performance, which is partially offset by higher taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than our original expectations for these properties. Early leasing is going well at Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta, and we expect to start leasing at Novel Val Vista in Phoenix in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we also reached stabilization at MAA LoSo in Charlotte. Despite permitting and approval processes that are taking a bit longer than we anticipated, predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects. we expect 3 projects will be ready to start construction in the back half of 2023, if we see sufficient adjustments to construction costs and rents to support our NOI yield expectations. These projects include 2 in-house developments, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Denver and 1 prepurchased joint venture development in Charlotte. We've pushed back the start of the Phase 2 to our West Midtown prepurchased development in Atlanta to the 2024 due to the approval process taking longer than anticipated. The team continues to work through the increased prepurchase development opportunities that have been presented to us, and we're hopeful we will be able to add additional currently unidentified development opportunities to our pipeline. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment, reflecting the significant slowdown in new starts expected over the balance of 2023 and 2024.  Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under-construction projects, and we're doing a tremendous managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures as well as labor constraints on our development costs and schedules. During the quarter, the team successfully completed and accepted delivery of the combined 249 units and Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim. Sorry, I just want to add to that real quick. You asked about our lease-up properties. To Tim's point, we've got 1 in lease-up in Austin. That one, we're offering up to a month free, which is on select units, by the way, not across the board. We've got a couple of hundred units competing supply just in that same submarket. So I'd say that one is probably feeling the most pressure. But I will say that average rents on that property are a couple $300 to $400 higher than what we expected. And then the average concession usage there is significantly below what we expected. Most of our new lease-ups, we expect about a month free, and we've been significantly [indiscernible] that on this asset. And then I would just say, all of our properties that are in lease-up right now, we're below what we generally pro forma, which is a month free, just we're offering that on select units as needed. So it's not broad-based use of concessions that we're seeing right now. Right. Nick, this is Brad. I would say it's really the belief that we think cap rates will tick up a bit from where they are right now. I mean the fundamentals generally are holding up pretty well within our region of the country, and we're not seeing distress certainly in our region and especially in these lease-up properties. We've seen cap rates tick up over the last year, 1.5 years and really what we believe right now with the limited amount of inventory that's on the market, the capital that's out there kind of piling up on each other on the assets that are coming to market. So that is driving down cap rates. We also continue to see a high proportion of the deals that do trade or 10.31 exchange as well as loan assumptions.  So we just believe that as the elevated supply that's occurred in our market over the last year, 2 years, begins to come to market. Those assets need to trade, merchant developers need to sell and as that product comes to market, it's likely to spread out the capital a bit and we're likely to see cap rates continue to move up a bit from where they are today. Today, interest rates are 5.5%, 5.75%. And I think when you layer on to that, just still good operating fundamentals, but not the 5%, 6%, 7% rent growth that we've seen over the last year.  I do think that, that continues to point to a scenario where the negative leverage continues to decrease, which supports increasing cap rates. So just for context, after the GFC, 3-year period after that, we purchased 9,000 units over a 3-year period. And I don't know if this situation will be as fruitful as that was for us, but it certainly feels like our region is really primarily driven by merchant developers and product needs to trade at some point, and we're starting to see cap rates move up a bit. So we're going to be patient and hold our capacity to what we think will be a better opportunity. Yes, John, this is Brad. Yes, I would say we're not seeing capitulation at this point. I think what we're seeing is selectively developers are looking to take some risk off the table on select assets when it makes sense for them to do so. I mean just for context in the first quarter, we track, I think, 7 deals that we had data points on. We're up to, call it, 14 in the second quarter. But I would also say the majority of those are not necessarily merchant developed assets. So again, not a lot of data points there. We've seen a few but not broad-based. I do think that, that is what we continue to monitor because as we get later into this year, to my comments earlier, I think the merchant developer profile and need to transact increases. But we haven't seen that really open up broadly at the moment."

            "name": "Al Campbell",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter, $2.28 per share was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest in overhead costs during the quarter, and a large portion of the overhead cost favorability is timing related with the cost now expected to be incurred in the back half of the year. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, blended lease pricing continues to outperform original expectations for the year and build stronger-than-expected longer-term revenue but was primarily offset in the second quarter by average occupancy slightly below forecast. Also, as expected, we began to see moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the second quarter with the growth of personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate expenses, tax expenses, excuse me, which combined represents 70% of total operating costs, all reflecting moderation from the prior quarter. We expect moderation for these items to continue through the remainder of the year, particularly for real estate taxes, which we'll discuss more with guidance in just a moment.  As mentioned in the release, our annual property and casualty insurance programs renewed on July 1, and with combined premium increase of approximately 20%, which is in line with our prior guidance. During the quarter, we invested a total of $26.3 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart reinstallation programs producing strong returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio.  We also funded just over $51 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $735 million pipeline, leaving $344 million remaining to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new deals over the next 12 to 18 months, likely expanding our development pipeline to be closer to $1 billion, which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant safety and future opportunity. Our leverage remains historically low, the debt-to-EBITDA at 3.4x, and our debt is currently 100% fixed for an average of 7.5 years at a record low 3.4%. We do have $350 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter but our current plan is to remain patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next few quarters before refinancing with long-term debt.  And finally, given the second quarter's earnings performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising our core FFO and several other areas of our guidance previously provided. With the blended pricing outperformance achieved through the second quarter, we are increasing the midpoint of our effective rent growth guidance to 7.4%, a 25 basis points increase. This is offset by a decrease in our physical occupancy guidance, which is now projected to average 95.5% for the full year, a 30 basis points decrease. Though this trade-off support slightly higher rental earning going forward, our total revenue growth guidance for this year remains unchanged at the midpoint of 6.25%.  In early July, the Texas state legislature passed the tax overhaul which significantly rolled back property tax rates across the state to effectively redistribute a budget surplus. Given aggressive property valuations, we had previously anticipated rate rollbacks in Texas, where we have now added a specific reduction for this legislation, which lowers our overall same-store real estate tax growth rate for the year by 50 basis points to 5.5% at the midpoint and that's $0.02 per share to core FFO for the year. There's still limited information regarding exactly how individual counties and municipalities will push this change through but our guidance now includes our early estimate of this overall impact, which is expected to be ongoing. In summary, we are increasing our core FFO projections for the full year to a midpoint of $9.14 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share. This increase is primarily comprised of a carry-through of $0.01 per share from the second quarter performance -- outperformance as well as the $0.02 per share addition related to the Texas legislation. As Brad mentioned, we also revised our transaction volume expectations for the current year to reflect current market conditions. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Aaron, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions. Yes, Eric, this is Al. We had started the year, if you remember, with 3% for the full year, but the outperformance we've seen through the first half, that's increased that. So I think for the full year, we didn't put that in our guidance. But if you do the math on it, it's about 3.5% for this year. And that means largely sticking to the 3% for most of the back half, though we started in July, as Tim talked about stronger than that. So you're probably averaging 3.1%, 3.2% for the back half and that projection now. I think as you talk about, I mean, too early to really get to a refinement '24, but certainly, we would expect some continued moderation, just some of the inflationary pressures begin to weighing. The 3 main areas, obviously, the personal repair, maintenance and taxes. Taxes, I would say, being the biggest, certainly it's going to follow the moderations of the top line. So it's a backward-looking thing. So you would naturally think that as '24 looking back to '23, which is a good year, but a more moderate year than it was in '22 that you should see some moderation there. So probably in those 3 that make up 70% of our expenses, you'll see some moderation at some level. Hard to ballpark at this point. I don't think it would be probably a long-term rate, but somewhere between we are today and that. So Brad, this is Al. And we've talked about for, I think, several quarters now. Certainly, we love the strength of our balance sheet, but our leverage is really below where we want long term at this point. We've been patient to allow opportunities come to us. So in our credit rating at A minus, 4.5 would be something you could be very confident so we're a full turn below that right now. So significant opportunity there, but willing to be patient to allow Brad to find the right investments. Alex, this is Al. I think, you see in the second and third quarter often, some things that are below same-store NOI, whether it be overhead, whether it be -- so just some items that are more -- that are not in your operating costs. And so second and third quarter, they tend to be chunky. What we're seeing is some of those costs we talked about that we outperformed in the second quarter on G&A. But that would be timing lag. Some of that's going to come back to us seeing some of that in the third quarter, which expects that a little bit. So nothing unusual. You see that second and third quarter be a little volatile, but the important point is just the projection for the year, continued strength. John, this is Al. I think the important point there, we didn't cover today, we've talked about it a bit in the past is that there is a little bit of dilution in that total revenue from the pricing line because there's other income components that are about 10% of our revenue stream that aren't growing, if they call it 7%. And so they're going 2% to 3%. And so that dilutes it some. So that's probably the difference there. But in general, the math that you laid out was the 5.5% carry in plus half of the pricing performance we've gotten this year, which is we've talked about was 3% -- 3.5% blended pricing, half of that. That gives you pretty close to the effective rent growth expectation we have this year and then those other income items dilute that just a bit. I'm just saying that the guidance is -- we think the guidance is accurate. There are things other than effective rents that are affecting that total revenue, John. There's items that are other income related that are growing call it, 2% to 3% that bring that down. So if you're looking at total revenue, I think the -- we brought it in just because we narrowed it, which we typically do, just because we have a little more information getting closer to the end of the year, but that midpoint of 6.25% in total revenue, we still feel that's the right number. No, Rob, we would read this at some level, it should be an ongoing benefit. I mean every -- what we've seen over the last several years is Texas because of the strength of the state has had really high valuations come out, property valuations. And we've seen millage rate rollbacks some more than others in different municipalities because of that because there is some limitation at the revenue level and budgetary level on taxes they can do. So we had projected a rate rollback. Now this because the overall budget surplus goes well beyond that. And so they basically recognizing that the [indiscernible] are full, recognizing that the state is doing very well, but valuations overall are very strong. So they're permanently reducing that rate, if you would, by legislation. Now the other side of that is in the future, if the economy in Texas is different, they could undo it. But this should be a permanent ongoing impact that's pretty significant. I mean it caps out to be something like $0.20 per $100 of value for your property values, and that's pretty significant. Not really. I think the one outstanding to really get the final information on other than Texas is Florida. It's the one that comes in late. And so we need to see the millage rates there. We've got the values. We need to see the millage rates coming in like a pretty significant. But other than that, getting a pretty clear picture at this point. We're about 70% of the knowledge at this point, I would say, Rob."

            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with stable occupancy low resident turnover and better blended rent performance than what we previously projected. Despite increasing supply pressure in some of our markets, blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.8% comprised of new lease growth of 0.5% and renewal growth of 6.8% was better than our forecasted expectations. While occupancy was slightly below our expected range for the quarter, the resulting higher blended lease growth performance is a favorable trade-off providing a greater future compounding growth effect. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show a typical seasonality that is to accelerate from the first quarter and renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 to moderate some, but still provide the catalyst to strong second quarter pricing performance. As Eric mentioned, this played out as expected with new lease pricing accelerating 100 basis points as compared to the first quarter and renewal pricing remaining strong. Alongside the pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained consistent with the first quarter at 95.5%, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 8.1%. The various demand factors we monitor remained strong in the second quarter with 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units would notice to vacate over the next 60 days, largely consistent with prior year at 8.5% versus 8.4% in the second quarter of last year. Furthermore, Quarterly resident turnover was down almost 2% from the prior year. Move-ins from markets outside of our footprint ticked up slightly from Q1 to 13% and rent to income ticked down slightly from Q1 to 22%. The employment market remains relatively strong also, particularly in the Sunbelt markets. While lead volume trailed the record demand scenarios we saw in 2021 and 2022, it is up from 2018 and 2019. And last years where we experienced a more normal demand curve.  Our prospect engagement platform that combines AI, marketing automation and scheduled human engagement has enabled us to engage with prospects more effectively. July to date, pricing remains ahead of our original expectations with blended pricing of 3.2%. This is comprised of new lease pricing of 0.3% and renewal pricing of 5.5%. The new lease pricing is relatively consistent with the 0.5% for the second quarter and within 5 basis points of June new lease pricing. As expected, renewal pricing is moderating to a more normal range as leases are beginning to expire that were signed in the period last year when renewal rents had caught up to new lease rents. Physical occupancy is currently 95.6% with average daily occupancy for July month to date of 95.3%. The current July occupancy and July exposure, which is even with the prior year, 7.5%, puts us in a good position for the remainder of the quarter. A key part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points.  As we compete with elevated supply deliveries, particularly in some of our larger markets, many of our mid-tier markets are performing well and leading the portfolio and pricing performance, both in the second quarter and into July. Savannah, Charleston, Richmond, Kansas City, Greenville and Raleigh are all outperforming the overall portfolio. We expect that this market diversification, combined with continued strong demand fundamentals will help mitigate the impact of new supply that we expect to be elevated over the next several quarters. Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the second quarter. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of Smart Home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the second quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 1,900 interior unit upgrades and installed nearly 2,300 Smart Home packages.  We are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative and now have over 92,000 units with this technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 15 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 5 projects that will begin repricing in the third quarter and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Al. Eric, this is Tim. With new lease growth, we did, as you said, we saw it accelerate some as we expected. It didn't accelerate quite as much as what we would see in a normal environment. I do think there's a little bit of supply pressure impact on that. Having said that, I don't really expect it to decelerate as much as it normally might would in Q3. It's typically kind of around this time that you start seeing new lease pricing moderate a little bit as demand starts to moderate some. So I don't expect the volatility, if you will, to be quite as large on the new lease side. On the renewal side, we talked about it from the beginning of the year, there was a sort of unusual scenario last year where for the first, call it, 7, 8 months of 2022, new lease pricing outpaced renewal pricing quite a bit. So we knew we had some opportunity kind of mark-to-market those that were on the renewal rates as the first part of last year. So we've kind of reached a point where we're lapping those and starting to reprice those. That's where you've seen the renewal pricing moderate a little bit, but we still expect it to be quite a bit stronger than new lease rates, which is typical and really just kind of returning to a normal seasonality scenario. Yes. This is Tim. It's -- the Bs are still outperforming a little bit. I would call it kind of a 40 to 50 basis point gap between what -- how we would define As versus Bs, and that's pretty consistent on the new lease side and the renewal side. So I think it's as part of the portfolio structure that we expect those markets that can be more of the B assets perform well and some of the supply or in most markets, the supply coming in, hasn't been quite as impactful on some of the more B assets. They've typically been much higher price, more urban-style assets and at a much higher rent than particularly some of the B assets. Yes. So there's a few things that we typically look at as a leading indicator of demand. You obviously have job growth at a macro level, which continues to be pretty strong and certainly stronger in a lot of the Sunbelt markets and then more granularly, we look at exposure, lead volume, what we call lead per exposed unit, which is really a combination of those 2 metrics and then also looking at what our renewal accept rates are. So on lead volume and leads for exposed, it's not at the level it was in '22, which was record demand. But as I noted in the comments, you go back to kind of the 2018, 2019 time frame when we saw more normal, if you will, demand scenario, we have -- our lead volume leads per exposed is quite a bit higher than those times. So that's encouraging that our renewal accept rates remained strong and higher to that period as well. We have 60% accept rate for July, 58% for August and 43% for September, which is at or above where we would expect or we would like to see it. And then a couple of other metrics, rent-to-income continues to stay consistent, stay lower, actually dropped a little bit from what it was in Q1, turnover remains low and reasons people moving out to buy house is way down. So all of those various factors, while not quite at the level we've seen with the record performance last year, still healthy and stronger than typical year, if you will. Also, this is Tim. On the occupancy front, we've kind of -- we've been hanging in that 95.5% range for really all of the first half of the year, which we've been comfortable with, as we mentioned, with pricing being a little bit better than we thought. So we're willing to make that trade-off with the compounding growth we can get from rents. As we moved into July, I can see it moderated a little bit. There is some unique circumstances in Atlanta that we can talk about that's driving that down a little bit, if you kind of pull Atlanta out of that number, we'd be right back to 95.5% on occupancy, which we're comfortable being in that range. So it hasn't it hasn't moved the needle. I don't think I'm a new lease rate a little bit. I mean there is some supply pressure that we've talked about. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything specifically tied to occupancy necessarily. Austin, it's Tim. When you say Gain to lease, meaning where there's ... Not -- I wouldn't say anything significant. Even -- we do have some negative new lease rates on a couple of those larger markets, but none of them are getting to out about, I mean they're kind of in that negative 1%, 5% range. So it's not a huge, huge variance in what we're seeing overall. So nothing significant that I would point out. So you've got -- I would point out Austin is, 1 that's been a little softer also in Phoenix, and we've talked about those 2 markets here for a while are kind of the 2 that I would point out that have been our weaker performers and certainly have some supply impact. It's great about the long term, obviously, we have great demand fundamentals, but those have been 2 that probably lead the list in terms of our higher concentration markets. No, I don't think it's primarily supply. I mean, supply is somewhat widespread across several of the larger markets in particular. And then it's nuanced to by market, obviously, and depending on where our portfolio is relative to some others. I mean, Charlotte is a good example. It's getting high level of supply, similar to some of these other markets, but it's performed well, and it's just kind of where our portfolio is positioned versus where the supply is coming in. So generally, I'd say supply, again, going back to the demand side. If you look at job growth across our markets compared to national averages, we're pretty consistently higher than average across all those markets. So there's obviously nuances by market but nothing notable outside of that. Well, one nuance there. The new lease pricing has done what we expected. It didn't decelerate or it didn't accelerate less than we expected. It accelerated a little bit less than what we've seen in the last couple of years, but in line with, if not slightly better than expectations. And so what we've seen is new lease pricing accelerate, just not quite as much as it may do in a lower supplied environment. So I think at the same time, given all the fundamentals we're seeing and the various metrics we talked about earlier, don't quite expect that new lease rate to drop off quite as much as it might normally for kind of the same reason been accelerated as much. So that's kind of how we see it playing out. But really have been as if not better than expected. Not really anything, Michael. It's probably taken a little bit longer for us to get an answer on the renewal side, but ultimately, as I mentioned, our renewal accept rates are better than they were a couple of years ago in a similar environment and kind of where we expect to see them. Our conversion rates are in line with period as well. So nothing notable other than -- I mentioned the leads are down a little bit from what we saw last year, but we would have expected that with the growth we saw last year. Yes. I mean also an advantage of the 2 that are the worst. I mean I wouldn't say we only have 2 or 3 that are feeling any supply impacts. I mean I think it is impacting several of our markets at some level. But what we've always talked about is with the demand being there, supply just sort of moderate things. It doesn't put a ditch. It says shocks on the demand side that really send rate growth negative for extended period of time, and we're not seeing that. So I mean I -- like I said, I wouldn't say there's only 2 we're feeling some supply pressure, but those are the most notable. But otherwise, demand is doing a pretty good job of mitigating things. Yes. A couple of things going there. I mean Atlanta is experiencing a decent amount of supply. It's not quite as high as some of our other markets, but relative to what Atlanta typically gets there. There is some supply pressure. But a couple of other things impacting that. You mentioned one of them. We had sort of late first quarter, early second quarter over the course of 2 or 3 months. We had about 100 units come back online in Atlanta, which was a mixture of some units that were down to storm damage and then a fire at one of our properties. And so pulling those back into the portfolio and meaning to lease those up had some impacts. And then secondly, which is hinders us a little bit in the short term, but is positive on the long term is Atlanta and the counties there have started to progress some on evictions and filings and doing court dates and kind of working through that whole process, which has been a real laggard in terms of our markets for working through that. So we actually year-to-date have seen about 140 more [Indiscernible] and skips this time versus the same period last year. So a good thing, as I said, long term, and we are seeing a little bit better payment progress there, but it kind of doubled down on some of the occupancy pressure there. Revenue and pricing has held in okay. It's a little bit below the market, but not are a little bit below the portfolio but not too bad. And overall, we obviously still feel good about it long term, but just running through a little bit of pressure right now. Yes. So for our portfolio, concessions are running about -- cash concessions are about 0.5% of rents. It's ticked up a little bit, but not significantly. I mean we do tend to net price with our pricing systems who don't use a ton of concessions. But broadly, at a market level and what we're seeing some of the competitors. I would say you're at a month free is about where we're at in several of the larger markets. And for most, that is more kind of in-town central areas of the markets, you might see a little bit more if there's a lease up in the area, but we're not seeing any more than a month and a half or so in any of our markets. Austin is one where it's a little unique in that we're actually not seeing a lot of concessions kind of in the Central Austin but more in the suburbs where there's quite a bit of supply. That's one where concessions are a little more prevalent in the suburbs versus other markets where it's more urban and fill. Yes. I mean, it obviously varies by market. There are some doing much better than others. But I would say and depending on what -- which market you divide in mid-tier versus not, you're probably somewhere in 100 to 150 basis point blended spread. So year-to-date, we're seeing several that are in that 4.5% to 5% range compared to our upper 3s overall portfolio. So I do think 100 to 200 basis points spread is probably about right. Yes, Rob, this is Tim. We talked about that a little bit. We do not have insight into that. We outsource sort of our credit check and income verification. So we don't have insight into that, certainly at any broad level and actually as part of income qualification and rent-to-income checks, you're not allowed to use student debt as part of that. So really don't have much insight into that, to be honest. Yes. I think I would expect renewals to remain above new, and that's not unusual. I mean, what we saw last year where new lease rates were quite a bit higher than renewals is more the exception than the norm. And so with renewals, you've got obviously, somebody that has lived with you and hopefully you provided good resident service and have an asset that they enjoy living in, and so there's some friction costs to move and all that. So typically, we would see renewals pretty consistently above new leases. So I don't expect it to get down to the new lease level. Yes. I mean it's difficult to nail down to a quarter, but I think our belief right now is kind of peaking early 2024 and then starting to trend down and then really set up for a good position as we get into 2025 in terms of lower deliveries."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded today April 27th, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer Senior Vice President Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Phyllis and good morning everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 1934 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric. \nEric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, first quarter results were ahead of expectations as solid demand for apartment housing continues across our portfolio. Consistent with the trends that we've seen for the past couple of years, solid employment conditions, positive net migration trends, and the high cost of single-family ownership are supporting continued demand for apartment housing across our portfolio. And while new supply deliveries are expected to run higher over the next few quarters, we continue to see net positive absorption across our portfolio. We believe that MAA's more affordable price point coupled with the unique diversification strategy including both large and secondary markets further supported by an active redevelopment program will help mitigate some of the pressure from higher new supply in several of our markets. As outlined in our earnings release our team is capturing steady progress and strong results from our various redevelopment and unit interior upgrade programs. We are on target to complete over 5,000 additional unit interior upgrades this year in addition to completing installation of new smart home technology for the entire portfolio. We're also making great progress with our more extensive property repositioning projects with the projects completed to-date capturing NOI yields in the high teens on incremental capital investment. These projects, coupled with a number of new technology initiatives, should provide additional performance upside from our existing portfolio. Our new development and lease-up pipeline is performing well and we remain on track to start four new development projects later this year. Our various lease-up projects have achieved rents that are close to 11% ahead of pro forma. We did not close on any acquisitions or dispositions during the quarter, but continue to believe that transaction activity will pick up over the summer and have kept our assumptions for the year in place. The portfolio is well-positioned for the important summer leasing season. Total occupancy exposure at the end of the quarter which is a combination of current vacancy plus notices to move out is consistent with where we stood at the same point last year. In addition leasing traffic remains solid with on-site visits in comparison to the number of exposed units that we have is actually running slightly ahead of prior year. A number of new leasing tools that we implemented over the course of last year should continue to support stronger execution and our teams are well prepared for the upcoming summer leasing season. I want to thank our associates for their hard work over the last few months to position us for continued solid performance over the balance of the year. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo: Thanks, Eric and good morning, everyone. Same-store growth for the quarter was ahead of our expectations with stable occupancy, low resident turnover and rent performance slightly ahead of what we expected. Blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.9% reflects the normal seasonality pattern that we expected. And while we did return to a more typical seasonal pattern in Q1, it is worth noting that the blended lease-over-lease pricing captured was higher than our typical Q1 performance. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show typical seasonality and that the renewal pricing which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 would provide a catalyst to first quarter pricing performance. This played out as expected with new lease pricing down slightly at negative 0.5%, and renewal pricing increasing positive 8.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.5% for the first quarter contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 11%. The various demand factors we monitor were strong in the first quarter and continued that way into April. 60-day exposure which represents all current vacant units plus those units with notices to vacate over the next 60 days at the end of Q1 was largely consistent with prior year at 7.7% versus 7.9% in the first quarter of last year. Furthermore in the first quarter, lead volume was higher than last year and quarterly resident turnover was down driving the 12-month rolling turnover rate down 30 basis points from 2022. April to-date trends remain consistent as exposure remains in line with the prior year and occupancy has remained steady at 95.5%. Blended lease-over-lease pricing effective in April is 4.1% with new lease pricing beginning to accelerate up 110 basis points from March at plus 0.2% and renewal pricing remaining strong at 7.9%. We expect renewal pricing to moderate some against tougher comps as we move into the late spring and summer, but simultaneously expect some seasonal acceleration in new lease-over-lease rates. We expect new supply in several of our markets to remain elevated in 2023 putting some pressure on rent growth. But as mentioned the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population growth, new household formations and steady job growth. In addition, we expect resident turnover to remain low as single-family affordability challenges support fewer move-outs. MAA's unique market diversification of portfolio strategy coupled with a more affordable price point as compared to the new product being delivered also helps lessen some of the pressures surrounding higher new supply deliveries. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the first quarter of 2023, we completed over 1,300 interior unit upgrades and installed over 18,000 smart home packages. We now have about 90,000 units with smart home technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 13 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another seven projects that will begin repricing in the second and third quarters and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad. \nBrad Hill: Thank you, Tim and good morning, everyone. While operating fundamentals across our platform have remained consistent as Tim just outlined transaction volume remains muted due to a lack of for-sale inventory on the market. For high-quality well-located properties bidding is strong and available capital is aggressively competing in order to win the bid and put capital to work. This strong relative investor demand coupled with often favorable in-place financing continues to support stronger-than-expected cap rates on closed transactions. Having said that, we believe the need to sell increases as the year progresses and it's likely that more compelling acquisition opportunities will materialize later in the year. Therefore, we have maintained our acquisition forecast for the year, but have pushed the timing back a couple of months. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to support our transaction needs. The properties managed by our lease-up team continue to outperform our original expectations generating higher earnings and creating additional long-term value. To-date our new lease-up properties' performance does not appear to be impacted by increased supply pressures. As Eric mentioned, these properties have achieved rents nearly 11% above our original expectations. During the first quarter, we began pre-leasing at our Novel Daybreak community in Salt Lake City, and early leasing demand is extremely strong with the property currently 11.5% pre-leased at rents well ahead of our expectations. Predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects, four of which should start construction in the back half of 2023: two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. During the first quarter we purchased a Phase 2 land site to our Packing District project in Orlando Florida, bringing our future development projects owned or under construction to 12, representing over 3,300 units. Over the past few months, we have seen an increase in inbound pre-purchase development opportunities due to a substantial decline in the availability of both debt and equity capital for new developments. We remain disciplined and selective in our review process but we are hopeful these calls will lead to additional currently unidentified development opportunities. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027 and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment reflective of the significant slowdown in new starts that we expect to continue to see over the balance of 2023 and 2024. Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our six under construction projects and are doing a tremendous job managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize inflationary and supply chain pressures on our development costs and our schedules. We have two projects that we'll be delivering units during the second quarter Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City, which delivered six units late in the first quarter and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And with that I'll turn it over to Al. \nAl Campbell: Thank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.28 for the quarter was $0.06 above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. About half of this favorability was related to the timing of certain expenses, which are now expected to be incurred over the remainder of the year, primarily related to real estate taxes. Operating fundamentals overall were slightly favorable to expectations for the quarter producing about $0.01 per share of favorability. And the remaining outperformance is related to overhead and net interest costs for the quarter. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection from market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter bringing our investment-grade rating to the A3 or A- level with all three agencies. We expect the favorable ratings to have a growing positive impact on our cost of capital as we work through future debt maturities. During the quarter, we also closed on the settlement of our forward equity agreement providing approximately $204 million net proceeds towards funding our development and other capital needs. We funded $38 million of redevelopment, repositioning and smart home installation costs during the quarter producing solid yields. We also funded just over $65 million of development costs during the quarter toward the projected $300 million for the full year. As Brad mentioned, we expect to start several new deals later this year and early next year, likely expanding our development pipeline to over $1 billion, for which our balance sheet is \u2013 remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with record low leverage, our debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times with over $1.4 billion of combined cash and available capacity under our credit facility with 100% of our debt fixed against rising interest rates for an average of 7.7 years and with minimal near-term debt maturities. And finally in order to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $9.11 per share, which is a $0.03 per share increase. We're also slightly narrowing the full year range to $8.93 and $9.29 per share. Given that the majority of the Q1 same-store outperformance was timing related and the bulk of the leasing season is ahead of us, we are maintaining our same-store guidance ranges as well as all of the key ranges for the year. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Phyllis, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions. Phyllis, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kim John with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Eric and Tim both mentioned in your prepared remarks that the more affordable price point is one of the reasons why you have such strong demand. And I'm wondering if there's any notable difference between your A and B product as far as demand or performance?\nTim Argo: Yeah, John, this is Tim. I mean we are seeing a little bit of a diversion not significant I would say in Q1, our what you might call our more B assets were about 70 basis points or so higher on blended pricing versus the more A and some things -- part of it is some of the price point. And certainly to the extent we've seen some supply pressure more of it's coming in typically in the more urban or A style types of assets.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is on the premiums that you're getting on renewals versus the new leases signed. I think it was 900 basis points in the first quarter, a little bit lower than 800 basis points in the second quarter so far. It still seems like a record amount as far as that premium you're getting. And I'm wondering when you think it goes back to the norm. At what level do you think it's fair premium on renewals?\nTim Argo: Yeah. I mean, we talked about a little bit last quarter that we knew with the unusual circumstances of last year where new lease pricing was ahead of renewal pricing for the bulk of 2022 that set us up with some good comps and some opportunity on the renewal side particularly in the first call it fix, six months in 2023. And so that's definitely what we've seen. I think as we get a little further in you'll see it moderate to more normal. I think it'd probably get down to the 6% or so range over the next few months, but don't expect it to be too volatile. We still think renewals will outpace new leases but get into a little bit more normalized range.\nJohn Kim: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hey, good morning everybody. Eric, you have highlighted that the price point does provide you some insulation as it relates to new supply. And certainly job growth has surprised to the upside earlier this year. If we start to see job growth slow, does that become more concerning as supply begins to ramp? And does pricing power just become more challenging for you later this year and maybe into early 2024?\nEric Bolton: Well, Austin, certainly if we see the employment markets pull back in any material way that will have an effect on demand at some level. I think that we've been through those periods before where the employment markets get much weaker. And there's no doubt that such a scenario does have an effect on demand. Having said that, we're in I think a unique -- all these cycles have their own unique elements to them. And in this particular cycle the -- what we see happening in the single-family market and the lack of single-family affordability is clearly working in our favor right now. And I would also suggest to you that in the event of a recession where there is weakness in the employment markets what really helps us at least on a relative basis I think is the fact that we are oriented in the Sunbelt. I think these Sunbelt markets have demonstrated historically an ability to weather downturn more so than some of the higher density coastal markets that tend to be more dominated by financial services insurance and banking. The diversification that we have in our -- that's one of the slides in our presentation deck that you can look at the latest presentation deck that really gives some insight on the diversification we have not only in markets but also in the employment sectors that we cater to that our residents work in. And I think that diversification coupled with the Sunbelt some of the other things that are relating to single family and so forth, while I think a recession certainly creates concern for everybody in the apartment sector. I think that I'm confident as we have historically always done in downturns that we'll likely hold up better.\nAustin Wurschmidt: No. That's all very helpful. And then just for my follow-up for projects that are in lease-up today have you kind of -- have you seen any slowdown in the pace of lease-up or absorption for those? And where are concessions today for yes assets in lease-up? Thank you.\nBrad Hill: Yeah. Hey. Austin, this is Brad. We really haven't seen any impact negative impact associated with supply pressures on our new lease-ups. And generally that's where you'd think we would see it first. We've got six or so projects that are in lease-up right now. Concessions on those we typically model about a month free. I'd say on three of those we're using some concession maybe up to 0.5 month free. We're not using the full concessions that we underwrote and we're not seeing the need to just generally, based on what we're seeing in the market. And I'd say our traffic continues to be really good on all of our lease-ups. The leases we're signing the velocity is really, really good. So we're not seeing any early indications yet, but that new supply is having an impact there.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks everybody.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChandni Luthra: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You guys talked about in your prepared remarks that cap rates are still going strong for good quality product. Could you remind us where they are tracking at the moment? And then, as you think about your own opportunity set down the line as you think about distressed opportunities emanating from the current supply situation and lending markets. Where would cap rates need to be for you to be comfortable buying and getting in the market?\nBrad Hill: Yeah, this is Brad. I'll certainly jump on that. We continue to see cap rates call it in the 4.7, 4.75 range for assets that fit that description well located strong markets. Interestingly in the first quarter, I mean, we only had seven data points. So again, it's -- the volume is down call it 70% year-over-year. So we don't have a whole lot of data points. But interestingly the band of those seven trades is pretty close together so -- which we haven't seen that historically. I would say for us cap rates definitely need to be over 5, 5.25, 5.5 something in that range. But I would say it's really going to depend on the asset what the rent trajectory looks like. And we're also looking at the after CapEx what it looks like in that nature as well. So that's pretty important to us. And I would say where opportunities might come for us are going to be properties that are early in their lease-up. That's where some of these developers tend to get a little bit more stress in their underwriting and in their performance. As some of the supply in our markets begins to come online some of these less experienced operators that are operating some of these new lease-ups could potentially struggle a bit to lease up those assets. And so I do think that's going to be an opportunity for us. And in fact that's really what our acquisition forecast is built on is buying assets that are in their initial stage of lease-up.\nChandni Luthra: That's very helpful. Thank you. And for my follow-up, as we think about new supply from a geographic standpoint, what are the markets where you're seeing most pressure? And how are you thinking about balancing occupancy versus pricing in those markets?\nTim Argo: Hi Chandni, this is Tim. Right now I'd Austin is probably the number one market in terms of where we're seeing supply. And Phoenix to an extent we're seeing a little bit. Honestly, some of the higher supply markets we're seeing like, Raleigh and Charlotte, Charleston are three of the markets where we're seeing a fair amount of supply have also been some of our best pricing markets so far this year. So as Eric kind of laid out earlier, we're not seeing a lot of pressure yet from supply. We're still getting the job growth and demand. There's, pockets here and there. But right now as we did in Q1, we're happy to keep pushing on price where we can. Our occupancy is at a stable point. And there's, a lot of things we monitor as kind of leading-edge demand indicators but still in a healthy balance right now.\nChandni Luthra: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: We will go next over to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Earlier you talked about the B product outperforming A product on a portfolio level. I was wondering if we can dive into a market or two to just kind of better understand some of the dynamics of what you're seeing in the A product versus the B product? And then, also, within that, can we talk about kind of like the larger markets that you're in versus the smaller markets? And if A versus B is performing differently in the large ones versus the smaller ones? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Yes. It's fairly consistent, I would say. Atlanta is probably a good example where we have quite a bit of diversification there. We've got several assets kind of in town, Midtown, Buckhead and then a lot of assets outside the perimeter and we're pretty consistently seeing the suburban assets perform better than those more urban assets. And that's playing out relatively consistent across some of the markets. We are seeing, what you might call, our secondary markets perform pretty well. I mentioned Charleston a moment ago. Savannah, Greenville some of these more secondary markets are holding up very well and doing really well in terms of pricing. And that's part of the strategy. I mean, typically those markets aren't going to get quite as much of the supply as some of these larger markets and that's playing out for us pretty well so far. \nMichael Goldsmith: Got you. And then, my follow-up question, just on the -- we talked about the job market and how the portfolio may react to that. I guess, my question is more related to just the in-migration to the Sunbelt. And what's that looking like versus pre-COVID levels? And are there any markets that you're seeing, where it is stronger or weaker in-migrations?\nEric Bolton: Michael, this is Eric. I would tell you that the in-migration that we're -- we saw in the first quarter with about 11% of the leases that we are writing, a function of people moving into the Sunbelt, that's pretty consistent with where we were prior to COVID. It began to move up a bit during 2020, late 2020 and throughout most of 2021, and then it started moderating a little bit in 2022. But right now, as we sit here today, roughly 11% or so of the move-ins that we are seeing are coming from people moving in from outside the Sunbelt. And that compares to 9% to 10% that we saw prior to COVID. Move-outs from the Sunbelt, the turnover we have where people are leaving us and moving out of the Sunbelt is still only about 3% to 4% of the move-outs that we're having are a function of people leaving the region. So, on a net basis, we're pretty close to where we were prior to COVID and would expect that those trends will likely now continue at the current level going forward.\nMichael Goldsmith: And when you say going forward, does that mean for the rest of 2023, or is that kind of for the intermediate term?\nEric Bolton: I would say the rest of 2023 into 2024. I think that, again, harking back to my earlier comments relating to the potential for moderation in the employment markets, we've seen these trends through these cycles that we've been through over the years, where migration trends are more positive, if you will, in the Sunbelt region. And it's been that way for many, many years, through recessions and through expansions in the economy. That continues to be the case. And so, I just continue to think that these markets and the portfolio strategy we have will serve us well long term. And I think the net positive migration trends that we see today will likely persist for the foreseeable future. \nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit of a feel for how the new lease growth on signings is differing by market. Just sort of an order of magnitude between better versus weaker markets, if you can give a little color on that. \nTim Argo: Yeah. Nick it's Tim. So if we think about where April is, it's anywhere from call it negative 1%, negative 2% for some of the lower markets, up to 3%, 4%, 5% on some markets. And it moved positive in April. As we talked about we're at 0.2% and we saw a good acceleration from March to April. We kind of expect to see that typical seasonality and a little more acceleration as we move through the spring and summer, but that gives you a little bit of an order of magnitude. \nNick Yulico: That's helpful. Thanks. Do you mind also just maybe saying which markets are the better versus weaker in that range?\nTim Argo: Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned before, Austin is one of the weaker ones. Austin and Phoenix are two that I would point out as a little bit on the weaker side. Orlando continues to be one of our strongest markets. And then I mentioned a moment ago as well we're seeing some of our more secondary markets perform really well. Also Charleston, Savannah, Richmond Greenville all holding up really well also.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. That's helpful. Just last question is on Atlanta. If you look the occupancy there is a bit lower than the rest of the portfolio. Can you just talk about what's going on there? And I guess also on Packing, I think you were saying that that's a market where suburban is doing better than urban. And so I'm not sure if it's -- if there's any sort of supply impact there that you're dealing with on occupancy or what's driving that? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Sure. Yeah, Atlanta is a little bit of a unique situation. So back in February, we had some winter storms. It affected Texas and Georgia also, but we particularly saw some impact in Atlanta and Georgia. We had about 70 units in Atlanta that were down that we took out of service through the storm and then brought them back up kind of in late February. So you had a pretty good chunky units in Atlanta that we had to get leased up. So that was really the occupancy story there. We've seen it kind of bottomed out in March, but we have seen April occupancy pick up. So I think Atlanta will continue to improve and be a pretty solid market for us later in the year.\nNick Yulico: Appreciate it.\nOperator: We will go next to Alan Peterson with Green Street. Your line is open.\nAlan Peterson: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Tim, I was just hoping you can shed some light on your planning for peak leasing. And if you're anticipating in some of your weaker markets whether or not you're going to have to use concessions to maintain occupancy call out the Austins or the Phoenixes of the world. \nTim Argo: Yeah. I mean there will be pockets. We're not -- we certainly haven't seen -- don't expect to see it at any sort of portfolio-wide level. If we look at Q1 total concessions were about 25 basis points as a percent of rent. We are seeing a little more in Austin call it half a month up to a month and then there's areas where if there's lease-up properties you may see a little bit more markets like Orlando, we're seeing no concessions, but we'll see it a little bit but I don't think any more than half to a month more than what we're kind of seeing right now. I don't really see it getting much different than what we see today.\nAlan Peterson: Understood. And that's on your assets or other competing assets nearby?\nTim Argo: More so on competing assets. I mean we have some. As I mentioned there's -- it's pretty minimal. And it kind of depends on the market. There are some markets where upfront concessions are more of staying in that market whereas others it's more of a net pricing scenario where you don't really see upfront concessions. So it kind of depends, but similar whether it's our properties or the market in general.\nAlan Peterson: Appreciate that. And Brad just one follow-up on your prepared remarks about debt and equity capital starting to dry up. The cost of buckets of capital out there where are some of your private peers the most concerned about when sourcing new financing today? What are some of the -- whether it be the banks or life insurance companies what buckets of capital right now are the ones that are seeing the most impact there?\nBrad Hill: Yeah. I mean most of our partners use bank financing for their developments. And so I'd say that's the biggest concern at this point. And given the last few weeks and just the restriction there in capital with banks, it's more acute than it has been. First quarter, it was difficult. Equity was difficult. Debt was difficult. And I'd say the debt piece has gotten even more difficult for them. But generally, they're going to regional banks for their banking needs. And they generally have strong relationships with these banks, so they can get a deal or two done with the banks but it's a lot more difficult. It takes a lot longer than what it has in the past. And so that's really restricting. One of the other areas that it's restricting new deals getting done and I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future.\nAlan Peterson: Appreciate that. Thanks for your time today guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.\nRob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Eric or Brad, you guys added Orlando land parcel this quarter. But overall how aggressively are you going to be in adding additional land parcels for development at this point? And are you seeing any relief in terms of the costs of land? Some of the peers have spoken about more office sites and vacant movie theaters and as such being sold for apartment development allowing for better deals. Curious as to what you're seeing in terms of that.\nBrad Hill: Yes Rob, this is Brad. As I mentioned we have 12 sites now that we either own or control. So we feel like we're in a good spot in terms of building out our pipeline going forward. And as Al mentioned, we think we're on pace for that $1 billion $1.2 billion or so in terms of projects going and we like where we're located. The asset that we purchased in Orlando is a Phase two to a project that we'll start this year. So there was a strategic reason for that. It's really a covered land play. There's some leased buildings on it right now. So, I'd say going forward, we'll be a bit more cautious on land. I would say, we'll continue to look for sites that have been dropped by other developers. We'll look to get time. A couple of the sites we have now, as I mentioned, are we control them we do not own them. So that's our preference to have time on the deals. And I'd say we're on the early stages or it appears that we're in the early stages of land repricing a bit in some areas. We've seen a 10% price reduction on some of the projects that some of the -- our partners are coming to us with sites for. They've been able to negotiate some additional time and some cost reduction. So I think we're on the early stages of that at this point.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tim or Al, where is bad debt or delinquency today? And how does that compare to the historical periods pre-COVID in recent comparable periods?\nTim Argo: Yes Rob, this is Tim. So if we look at Q1, for example, all the rents that we billed in Q1, we collected 99.4% of that, so 60 basis points of bad debt which is consistent right in line with where we were last year. If you factor in prior month collections and any collection agency, it goes down about 50 basis points. So really remains pretty minimal.\nRob Stevenson: And is there any markets in particular that you're seeing any material higher amounts in?\nTim Argo: Atlanta is probably the one I would point out, where it's just still kind of the court system and everything going on there. It's taken a little longer to move through the process. So it's our highest one right now, probably closer to around 1% or so. But that's really the only market where we're seeing that.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: And we will go next to Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Hello, can you hear me?\nAl Campbell: Yes.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Hi, everyone. Hoping you can help me understand the increase in guidance a little bit better. Again you kind of talked about in 1Q you had some OpEx kind of tailwinds that could potentially become headwinds going forward. So you're not changing same-store NOI. But so trying to really understand what was that slide into is number one? And then number two, it sounds like based on spring leasing fees and you see the FFO guidance with them.\nAl Campbell: Yes Tayo, that's a good question. As we talked about a little bit, we -- the first quarter obviously we outperformed $0.06 according to our midpoint. And about half of that was timing as I mentioned. It's really some expenses some favorability we had in the first quarter. The bulk of that was real estate taxes that, we still think our full year guidance number is correct, so we'll fill that over the year. So the first $0.03 increase in core FFO was the other items coming through. I would say a-third of that or $0.01 was really operating forms. As Tim mentioned, we were favorable particularly in pricing. It was for the first quarter what we expect. I think we -- if you remember our guidance or our discussion in same guidance was that our pricing expectation for the full year was 3% and the quarter first quarter is 3.9%. So that's a little bit of favorability. But given that, we have the bulk of the leasing season ahead of us a lot of work to be done we just felt like our ranges in our guidance are still where they need to be there. And the other part of the favorability of FFO that flowed through were things below NOI overhead interest and those things. So really the same store was good that we were -- I would call it favorable slightly favorable to on point of what we expected. And we'll wait to see what happens over the next couple of quarters. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk a bit about kind of new lease spreads for the quarter? Again that was kind of -- it was negative. Just kind of see as the thoughts there whether it really is a supply issue whether there's a bit more of a demand issue and how we should kind of think about that kind of especially going into like your core spring leasing season?\nTim Argo: Yeah. Tayo this is Tim. I mean I think one thing to keep in mind the new lease rates that we saw in Q1 are really pretty typical, if we go back through history. If you look outside of last year the kind of the lease rates we were seeing were pretty much in line or better frankly than most of the years we've been tracking it. So it was pretty much as expected. I mean March new lease rates dropped a little bit and it was really more function of similar to what I was talking about with Atlanta earlier where we saw leasing activity drop for a couple of weeks there in February with some of the stores, particularly in Texas and Georgia that impacted occupancy a little bit in February. And then we were able to regain that occupancy in March but it did come at the expense a little bit of some of the new lease pricing but as we talked about with April where we saw new lease spreads accelerate and move positive. So from where we sit right now all the demand metrics look strong exposures, where we want it leads traffic volume all that is where we would expect. So I think we'll move into the rest of the spring and the summer a strong leasing season and see some acceleration and see what we would typically expect out of a pretty strong supply-demand dynamic. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nBarry Luo: This is Barry Luo on for Haendel St. Juste. My first question was on property taxes. I was just wondering how that was trending versus expectations since Cato's release in the back half?\nAl Campbell: Yes, this is Al. I can give you some color on that. So right now, we expect that our estimates that we put out in our guidance for property taxes we left that the same. We think we still have a good range that we've got. We did have some favorability in the first quarter on property taxes, as I just mentioned a minute ago but really that's related to the timing of some of the activity. We had some -- the appeals from prior year they come in and the timing can be different year-to-year. We had some wins that we achieved in the first quarter on some of our prior year pills that were good. We got them a little earlier than we thought. We still have a lot of fights both for prior year to go and a lot of the information for this year to come in. So on balance we have about 6.25% growth that we expected for this year. We still -- at the midpoint of our guidance we still think that is right. I would tell you that, we still in terms of current year don't have a lot of information yet. We feel like we have a good view on value but a lot of the information the stubs from the municipalities come out probably mostly in the second quarter. So as we're talking next quarter I should have 60% to 70% knowledge on that. And then the millage rates will come more in the third and even some in the fourth quarter. So we feel like our range is good. I would say that, we've continued -- the pressures coming from Texas, Florida and Georgia that's continuing to be the case as it has been for several years. I would say that, as we move forward into 2024 as they're looking backwards toward this more normalized year hopefully we begin to see some moderation in that line.\nBarry Luo: Got Okay. Thank you. And just we get Texas in particular so noticing a significant expense decline sequentially so 11% for Fort Worth and I think 6% for Austin. Is some of that being driven by property tax relief, or what's kind of driving that? Thanks.\nAl Campbell: I think there's some property tax in that for sure, but I mean Tim can answer, as well. But I think overall, we expected the first quarter expenses for all categories together in the company has held to be pretty high in the first quarter. Really, for many of the groupings because of the comparisons for last year, as we saw inflation kind of come into our business more in the second third and fourth quarter last year, we expected our property -- our operating expenses to be high.  Actually, they were 8.3% so where we came out was favorable to our expectations, what we had said as Tim mentioned. So what we would expect to see is some key items, personnel, repair and maintenance begin to moderate as we move back into the second third and fourth quarter of the year, with really the outstanding points of continued pressure being taxes, insurance areas primarily. Does that answer the question? \nBarry Luo: So \u2013 well, I was more looking at like the sequential decline from 4Q in Fort Worth versus 1Q in Fort Worth looks like somewhere [indiscernible] \nEric Bolton: Decline in\u2026\nTim Argo: Yes. I think the sequential decline all those Texas markets, I think was pretty much real estate tax relief. Just the timing of accruals and settlements, and all that it can be pretty volatile from quarter-to-quarter, but normalizes over the course of the year. \nAl Campbell: Yes. And that's where you're seeing, some of those items particularly in Texas, where we had the real estate tax prior appeals coming in, that's some of that occurring. \nBarry Luo: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you. And good morning, down there. So two questions. First, just going back to the supply just because it's a big topic that always comes up with the Sunbelt. You guys, articulated a lot of how your portfolio is doing. Would you say, it's more just your rent versus new supply, or would you say, it's more just proximity meaning that your properties are less of -- end up less likely to be near where the new supply is? Meaning that, the new supply is in other parts of the market and therefore, like where you cited some supply-heavy markets where you guys actually did well, it's because just proximity in general your portfolio doesn't line up where a lot of the new product is being built. I'm just trying to understand. \nEric Bolton: Hi, Alex, this is Eric. I would say, it's both of the points that you're making that are at play here. Where we do see supply coming into a market more often than not it is in some of the more urban-oriented submarkets. And when you look at our portfolio, and the footprint we have and the diversification we have, across a number of these markets particularly the big cities like Atlanta and Dallas, we have generally more exposure to the suburban markets versus the urban markets. So, I think there is a supply proximity point, that I would point to that you're mentioning that probably works in our favor to some degree. It's hard to -- and it will vary of course by market. And then the other thing, that you pointed to which I think is also at play here, is the price point that broadly we have our portfolio. When you look at the average effective rent per unit of our portfolio and compare it to the average rent of the new product coming into the markets, we still are somewhere in the 25% plus or minus range below where new product is pricing. And again, it will vary a bit by market, but that certainly provides some level of protection against the supply pressure and offers the rental market, a great value play in renting from us versus something that may be down the street that's newer but considerably more expensive. And with some of the renovation work that we're doing, frankly that's what creates the opportunity for us to do some of this renovation work and effectively offer the resident in the market, what it feels like a brand-new apartment on the interior but still at a meaningful discount to what they would have to pay in rent for something brand new. So, there are a multitude of factors that play and it varies by market. But certainly, we cannot absolutely eliminate new supply pressure but there after being in this region for 30 years, we've learned how to do some things to help at least mitigate the pressure, a little bit here and there. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is, on insurance certainly a hot topic especially in Florida and Texas with big premium jumps. Are you guys seeing opportunities where some of your smaller players or maybe some of the merchant recent new developments may have -- they may not have underwritten 50% type premium increases and therefore that could gin up some buying opportunities? Do you think that you would see that potentially people having to sell because of insurance pressure? \nBrad Hill: This is Brad. I definitely think that that is something to keep an eye on. I do think the market down there right now is extremely tough. And depending on where you are in Tampa or South Florida, those insurance premiums are increasing substantially for new product. So I would say, for newly developed properties in those areas Tampa, Orlando not as much, but Jacksonville, it's something for us to keep an eye on, because I do think that the insurance premiums are going to be a lot higher than the developer underwrote than they expected. And I do think there's going to be some impact to the sales proceeds as a part of that. And so I think as you get some of the supply pressures coupled with that and some of the leasing pressures those are areas that we'll keep an eye on. And then obviously, we have the benefit with our broader portfolio and insurance pricing that that definitely is a platform benefit for us.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.\nWes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. Just had a quick question on capital allocation. I know your stock's yielding low six to maybe mid-6 implied cap. So how do you view a potential buyback versus starting new developments at this part of the cycle? \nEric Bolton: Well, Wes, this is Eric. I would tell you right now, we believe that what really is important to have is a lot of strength in capacity on the balance sheet. Obviously, we're in a very turbulent environment at the moment. Capital markets are very turbulent. There's still obviously some level of risk in the broader economy. And so we really believe that the thing to do right now is to protect capacity and keep the balance sheet in a strong position not only for defensive reasons. But as Brad has alluded to, we do think as we get later in the year that we may see some improving opportunities on the acquisition front. We have four -- as Brad alluded to we have four projects that we may start. We're scheduled to start later this year. These are projects that would deliver in 2026 into 2027. So I think that that level of development is something that we feel very comfortable with. These would be -- of course, it's -- we're still fine-tuning a lot of the numbers and pricing is not yet locked in. But we are seeing some early indication of some relief on some of the pricing metrics. And of course by the time we get to 2026 and 2027 we think the leasing environment is likely to be pretty strong given the supply pullback that we expect to start to see happening late in 2024 and 2025. So we would anticipate that these will be some very attractive investments that we could potentially start later this year and would reconcile very nicely to even where our current cost of capital is. So we certainly understand the metrics and the math on all this and pay close attention to it. We don't think we're going to ramp up a lot more than that at this point in the cycle, but we feel pretty good about the four opportunities that we're looking at the moment. \nWes Golladay: Okay. And then maybe if we can go to that topic of distress. I mean, a lot of the private owners right now do you feel that they may be upside down and the banks are just extending the opportunity right now, or do they have significant equity just need maybe a capital infusion? \nBrad Hill: Yes. I mean, I don't think that we are seeing any distress in the market right now. I mean the projects just like our portfolio the operating fundamentals are very strong. So even on some of these lease-ups when they underwrote them in 2021 or so the leasing fundamentals are going to be a lot stronger than what they expected. And even the joint venture projects that we started in 2021 cap rates were in the 5%, 5.5% range on the valuation. I mean, that's kind of where we are. So, I would say that the developers have been somewhat disciplined in their underwriting in the last couple of years and the operating fundamentals are outperforming. So, they won't get the pricing that they could have gotten 1.5 years ago, but there's still profit in a lot of these projects, so we're not seeing that yet. Where I think the distress could come are projects that closed a year, 1.5 years ago and they did some type of financing cap or something that's coming due and it's going to require a reset of -- or a pay down in order to get that loan rightsized and the debt service coverage rightsized. Those are going to be the ones I think that are going to have a little bit of trouble.\nWes Golladay: Great. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: And we will go next to Eric Wolfe with Citi. Your line is open.\nEric Wolfe: Just to follow up to your answer there a moment ago. You mentioned your balance sheet is just in incredible shape. I don't think I've -- can remember seeing an apartment company at sort of mid-three times leverage down to probably low three times later this year. So my question is really sort of what would it take what type of opportunity would you need to see, before you'd be willing to take your leverage back up to a more normal sort of five times amount? And I guess, if a portfolio came across that was like in say the 5.5% to 6% range, would that be interesting enough to allow you to take your leverage back up?\nEric Bolton: Well, Eric this is -- I'll start and Al you can jump in. But we do anticipate that over the course of the next year or two that we will see leverage probably edge back up just a little bit, believing that we will -- if nothing else, we've got some development funding that we'll do. And of course the funding that we're doing on our redevelopment work and repositioning work is super -- very, very accretive. And so, we will begin to see leverage move a little bit back up. But having said that, we just think right now, given the uncertainty in the broader capital markets landscape and what we imagine to be likely an opportunity for more distressed asset buying that capacity right now is a good thing to have. And so we're going to hold on to that. And I do think that obviously, if we did see some larger opportunity come across that we felt made sense for us strategically and felt like, we could do something closer to 5.5% to 6% range from a cap rate perspective that probably would certainly get our attention. And obviously, it depends on a lot of different other variables. But we like where the balance sheet is right now, given the broader landscape that we have with the capital markets and the transaction market. And so, we're going to be very cautious in how we put that capacity to work. We've got some known needs that I've just mentioned that are very attractive investments and we'll continue to move forward with those. We don't have any certainly need to go attract additional capital right now. And as Al alluded to the debt portfolio is in terrific position, a lot of duration and it's all 100% fixed. So, we're going to sit tight with what we have at the moment largely.\nAl Campbell: I'll just add just quickly that Eric that's a very good point you make that really our target -- long-term target is closer to 4.5 times to 5 times on the EBITDA coverage. I mean, we're providing opportunity right now as Eric mentioned and hopefully they will find those expect to be able to find those. And long term our target is in line with what you mentioned.\nEric Wolfe: Thanks for that. And then, just on a related guidance question. You did 3.9% in terms of blended spread first quarter. It sounds like you expect to accelerate through the balance of the peak leasing season. So my question is really, just how did it get down to that 3% blend that's in your guidance? Is it just a steep dropoff later this year or just some conservative baked in there?\nAl Campbell: I'm going to start with it and Tim can give some more details. What I would say primarily is, one, we need to see the bulk of leasing season happen as it comes. So we're providing opportunity to see that and get more information. We're encouraged certainly by what we saw in the first quarter. And I think secondly, the biggest point would be, we do expect to see that seasonality in the most acute if you would in the fourth quarter. That's typically what it is in a normal year. That's sort of what we're expecting. So we could see that new lease pricing be a little more negative in that fourth quarter because the holiday season and demand just really shuts down in that period. So that's what we provided for in our forecast I think at this point. \nTim Argo: Yes, Eric, this is Tim. I mean, I think, it will kind of boil down to new lease pricing that we see over the late spring and summer will be the ball game in terms of whether it ends up a little better than we thought or a little worse. You have obviously the bulk of the leases happening during that period. And they carry for several months throughout the year. So they have certainly an outsized impact. So if those new lease rates accelerate more then it probably is a little better than we thought, if they accelerate not quite as much probably a little less because renewals are going to be relatively consistent through the rest of the year. \nEric Wolfe: Got it. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: We will go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nJamie Feldman: Right. Thank you and good morning. I want to go back to your comments about 11% of leases written in the first quarter were new people moving into Sunbelt. Can you provide more color on that data point across the different markets? And I guess I'm thinking more about maybe some of the larger MSAs versus the smaller MSAs. \nTim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. So 11% overall and probably markets you would expect. In terms of in-migration Phoenix is our top market. You have about 18% of move-ins out of the market going into Phoenix. Tampa was another big one at 15%. Charlotte was 13%. Charleston and Savannah were pretty high in there as well. And so those are the biggest drivers. And that's been pretty consistent throughout the last several quarters as the ones that are benefiting the most. \nJamie Feldman: Interesting. And then I guess similarly if you think about the lay-up activity I guess those are also the markets where you've seen the most growth in tech jobs or jobs that might be most at risk. Can you talk at all about how lay-up activity might be impacting the different types of MSAs and even at statistics specifically? Just trying to kind of think through the next 12 months or so. \nTim Argo: Yes. I mean we haven't seen a ton of impact yet. I mean I think certainly the technology sector is getting a lot of publicity and a lot of -- there's layoffs out there but I do think a lot of the other sectors are still in the net hiring position. Austin's one particularly in North Austin where we've seen a little bit of impact from that some of the tech jobs up in North Austin, but at the same time you've got Tesla still planning to expand over the next couple of years there. You've got Oracle moving their headquarters there. So certainly long term in Austin it's a job machine and we feel really good about that. Outside of that we haven't seen a lot. Phoenix been tight a little bit. But again we've got properties there with it's a huge semiconductor plant coming in right there in one of our properties. So there's a little bit of short-term pressure over the next few quarters, but long term feel really good about all of those markets. \nJamie Feldman: Okay. Thank you. And then I know you talked about insurance and taxes on the expense side. Just as we think about your guidance for the year any other variables or line items on the expense side that maybe you don't feel quite as confident or maybe there could be some changes there? I know you got your insurance coming up in July your renewal. \nAl Campbell: Those are the two big items. I mean I think that expense -- the key components of expenses for the year are personnel, repair and maintenance taxes and insurance. I think we -- the first two we expect to moderate as the year progresses as we talked about and taxes and insurance remaining the biggest items that have the most unknown at this point. So that's ones we're keeping our eye on at this point. \nJamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. \nLinda Tsai: Hi. Maybe just as a short follow-up to that last question. In terms of rationale for move-out job transfers and buying a new home has the balance of these reasons shifted since 4Q and any regional trends you'd highlight? \nTim Argo: I mean it's pretty consistent. One we've seen move-outs to buy a house has dropped dramatically. As you would expect with what interest rates have done we've seen our move-outs due to rent increase drop quite a bit as well. The biggest reason for move-outs which is always consistently our largest read to put move-out is just a change in the job and job transfers and that's up a little bit. But it's -- as we've talked to people out on site it's more just people moving for another job as opposed to any significant job losses. So turnover -- it's overall is down a little bit but it's the -- some of the key reasons that we've talked about before and pretty, pretty consistent across markets no matter if larger markets or secondary markets. \nLinda Tsai: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks. \nEric Bolton: Well no additional comments to add. So we appreciate everyone joining us and I look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, first quarter results were ahead of expectations as solid demand for apartment housing continues across our portfolio. Consistent with the trends that we've seen for the past couple of years, solid employment conditions, positive net migration trends, and the high cost of single-family ownership are supporting continued demand for apartment housing across our portfolio. And while new supply deliveries are expected to run higher over the next few quarters, we continue to see net positive absorption across our portfolio. We believe that MAA's more affordable price point coupled with the unique diversification strategy including both large and secondary markets further supported by an active redevelopment program will help mitigate some of the pressure from higher new supply in several of our markets. As outlined in our earnings release our team is capturing steady progress and strong results from our various redevelopment and unit interior upgrade programs. We are on target to complete over 5,000 additional unit interior upgrades this year in addition to completing installation of new smart home technology for the entire portfolio. We're also making great progress with our more extensive property repositioning projects with the projects completed to-date capturing NOI yields in the high teens on incremental capital investment. These projects, coupled with a number of new technology initiatives, should provide additional performance upside from our existing portfolio. Our new development and lease-up pipeline is performing well and we remain on track to start four new development projects later this year. Our various lease-up projects have achieved rents that are close to 11% ahead of pro forma. We did not close on any acquisitions or dispositions during the quarter, but continue to believe that transaction activity will pick up over the summer and have kept our assumptions for the year in place. The portfolio is well-positioned for the important summer leasing season. Total occupancy exposure at the end of the quarter which is a combination of current vacancy plus notices to move out is consistent with where we stood at the same point last year. In addition leasing traffic remains solid with on-site visits in comparison to the number of exposed units that we have is actually running slightly ahead of prior year. A number of new leasing tools that we implemented over the course of last year should continue to support stronger execution and our teams are well prepared for the upcoming summer leasing season. I want to thank our associates for their hard work over the last few months to position us for continued solid performance over the balance of the year. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Well, Austin, certainly if we see the employment markets pull back in any material way that will have an effect on demand at some level. I think that we've been through those periods before where the employment markets get much weaker. And there's no doubt that such a scenario does have an effect on demand. Having said that, we're in I think a unique -- all these cycles have their own unique elements to them. And in this particular cycle the -- what we see happening in the single-family market and the lack of single-family affordability is clearly working in our favor right now. And I would also suggest to you that in the event of a recession where there is weakness in the employment markets what really helps us at least on a relative basis I think is the fact that we are oriented in the Sunbelt. I think these Sunbelt markets have demonstrated historically an ability to weather downturn more so than some of the higher density coastal markets that tend to be more dominated by financial services insurance and banking. The diversification that we have in our -- that's one of the slides in our presentation deck that you can look at the latest presentation deck that really gives some insight on the diversification we have not only in markets but also in the employment sectors that we cater to that our residents work in. And I think that diversification coupled with the Sunbelt some of the other things that are relating to single family and so forth, while I think a recession certainly creates concern for everybody in the apartment sector. I think that I'm confident as we have historically always done in downturns that we'll likely hold up better. Michael, this is Eric. I would tell you that the in-migration that we're -- we saw in the first quarter with about 11% of the leases that we are writing, a function of people moving into the Sunbelt, that's pretty consistent with where we were prior to COVID. It began to move up a bit during 2020, late 2020 and throughout most of 2021, and then it started moderating a little bit in 2022. But right now, as we sit here today, roughly 11% or so of the move-ins that we are seeing are coming from people moving in from outside the Sunbelt. And that compares to 9% to 10% that we saw prior to COVID. Move-outs from the Sunbelt, the turnover we have where people are leaving us and moving out of the Sunbelt is still only about 3% to 4% of the move-outs that we're having are a function of people leaving the region. So, on a net basis, we're pretty close to where we were prior to COVID and would expect that those trends will likely now continue at the current level going forward. I would say the rest of 2023 into 2024. I think that, again, harking back to my earlier comments relating to the potential for moderation in the employment markets, we've seen these trends through these cycles that we've been through over the years, where migration trends are more positive, if you will, in the Sunbelt region. And it's been that way for many, many years, through recessions and through expansions in the economy. That continues to be the case. And so, I just continue to think that these markets and the portfolio strategy we have will serve us well long term. And I think the net positive migration trends that we see today will likely persist for the foreseeable future. Decline in... Hi, Alex, this is Eric. I would say, it's both of the points that you're making that are at play here. Where we do see supply coming into a market more often than not it is in some of the more urban-oriented submarkets. And when you look at our portfolio, and the footprint we have and the diversification we have, across a number of these markets particularly the big cities like Atlanta and Dallas, we have generally more exposure to the suburban markets versus the urban markets. So, I think there is a supply proximity point, that I would point to that you're mentioning that probably works in our favor to some degree. It's hard to -- and it will vary of course by market. And then the other thing, that you pointed to which I think is also at play here, is the price point that broadly we have our portfolio. When you look at the average effective rent per unit of our portfolio and compare it to the average rent of the new product coming into the markets, we still are somewhere in the 25% plus or minus range below where new product is pricing. And again, it will vary a bit by market, but that certainly provides some level of protection against the supply pressure and offers the rental market, a great value play in renting from us versus something that may be down the street that's newer but considerably more expensive. And with some of the renovation work that we're doing, frankly that's what creates the opportunity for us to do some of this renovation work and effectively offer the resident in the market, what it feels like a brand-new apartment on the interior but still at a meaningful discount to what they would have to pay in rent for something brand new. So, there are a multitude of factors that play and it varies by market. But certainly, we cannot absolutely eliminate new supply pressure but there after being in this region for 30 years, we've learned how to do some things to help at least mitigate the pressure, a little bit here and there. Well, Wes, this is Eric. I would tell you right now, we believe that what really is important to have is a lot of strength in capacity on the balance sheet. Obviously, we're in a very turbulent environment at the moment. Capital markets are very turbulent. There's still obviously some level of risk in the broader economy. And so we really believe that the thing to do right now is to protect capacity and keep the balance sheet in a strong position not only for defensive reasons. But as Brad has alluded to, we do think as we get later in the year that we may see some improving opportunities on the acquisition front. We have four -- as Brad alluded to we have four projects that we may start. We're scheduled to start later this year. These are projects that would deliver in 2026 into 2027. So I think that that level of development is something that we feel very comfortable with. These would be -- of course, it's -- we're still fine-tuning a lot of the numbers and pricing is not yet locked in. But we are seeing some early indication of some relief on some of the pricing metrics. And of course by the time we get to 2026 and 2027 we think the leasing environment is likely to be pretty strong given the supply pullback that we expect to start to see happening late in 2024 and 2025. So we would anticipate that these will be some very attractive investments that we could potentially start later this year and would reconcile very nicely to even where our current cost of capital is. So we certainly understand the metrics and the math on all this and pay close attention to it. We don't think we're going to ramp up a lot more than that at this point in the cycle, but we feel pretty good about the four opportunities that we're looking at the moment. Well, Eric this is -- I'll start and Al you can jump in. But we do anticipate that over the course of the next year or two that we will see leverage probably edge back up just a little bit, believing that we will -- if nothing else, we've got some development funding that we'll do. And of course the funding that we're doing on our redevelopment work and repositioning work is super -- very, very accretive. And so, we will begin to see leverage move a little bit back up. But having said that, we just think right now, given the uncertainty in the broader capital markets landscape and what we imagine to be likely an opportunity for more distressed asset buying that capacity right now is a good thing to have. And so we're going to hold on to that. And I do think that obviously, if we did see some larger opportunity come across that we felt made sense for us strategically and felt like, we could do something closer to 5.5% to 6% range from a cap rate perspective that probably would certainly get our attention. And obviously, it depends on a lot of different other variables. But we like where the balance sheet is right now, given the broader landscape that we have with the capital markets and the transaction market. And so, we're going to be very cautious in how we put that capacity to work. We've got some known needs that I've just mentioned that are very attractive investments and we'll continue to move forward with those. We don't have any certainly need to go attract additional capital right now. And as Al alluded to the debt portfolio is in terrific position, a lot of duration and it's all 100% fixed. So, we're going to sit tight with what we have at the moment largely. Well no additional comments to add. So we appreciate everyone joining us and I look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Eric and good morning, everyone. Same-store growth for the quarter was ahead of our expectations with stable occupancy, low resident turnover and rent performance slightly ahead of what we expected. Blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.9% reflects the normal seasonality pattern that we expected. And while we did return to a more typical seasonal pattern in Q1, it is worth noting that the blended lease-over-lease pricing captured was higher than our typical Q1 performance. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show typical seasonality and that the renewal pricing which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 would provide a catalyst to first quarter pricing performance. This played out as expected with new lease pricing down slightly at negative 0.5%, and renewal pricing increasing positive 8.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.5% for the first quarter contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 11%. The various demand factors we monitor were strong in the first quarter and continued that way into April. 60-day exposure which represents all current vacant units plus those units with notices to vacate over the next 60 days at the end of Q1 was largely consistent with prior year at 7.7% versus 7.9% in the first quarter of last year. Furthermore in the first quarter, lead volume was higher than last year and quarterly resident turnover was down driving the 12-month rolling turnover rate down 30 basis points from 2022. April to-date trends remain consistent as exposure remains in line with the prior year and occupancy has remained steady at 95.5%. Blended lease-over-lease pricing effective in April is 4.1% with new lease pricing beginning to accelerate up 110 basis points from March at plus 0.2% and renewal pricing remaining strong at 7.9%. We expect renewal pricing to moderate some against tougher comps as we move into the late spring and summer, but simultaneously expect some seasonal acceleration in new lease-over-lease rates. We expect new supply in several of our markets to remain elevated in 2023 putting some pressure on rent growth. But as mentioned the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population growth, new household formations and steady job growth. In addition, we expect resident turnover to remain low as single-family affordability challenges support fewer move-outs. MAA's unique market diversification of portfolio strategy coupled with a more affordable price point as compared to the new product being delivered also helps lessen some of the pressures surrounding higher new supply deliveries. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the first quarter of 2023, we completed over 1,300 interior unit upgrades and installed over 18,000 smart home packages. We now have about 90,000 units with smart home technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 13 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another seven projects that will begin repricing in the second and third quarters and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad. Yeah, John, this is Tim. I mean we are seeing a little bit of a diversion not significant I would say in Q1, our what you might call our more B assets were about 70 basis points or so higher on blended pricing versus the more A and some things -- part of it is some of the price point. And certainly to the extent we've seen some supply pressure more of it's coming in typically in the more urban or A style types of assets. Yeah. I mean, we talked about a little bit last quarter that we knew with the unusual circumstances of last year where new lease pricing was ahead of renewal pricing for the bulk of 2022 that set us up with some good comps and some opportunity on the renewal side particularly in the first call it fix, six months in 2023. And so that's definitely what we've seen. I think as we get a little further in you'll see it moderate to more normal. I think it'd probably get down to the 6% or so range over the next few months, but don't expect it to be too volatile. We still think renewals will outpace new leases but get into a little bit more normalized range. Hi Chandni, this is Tim. Right now I'd Austin is probably the number one market in terms of where we're seeing supply. And Phoenix to an extent we're seeing a little bit. Honestly, some of the higher supply markets we're seeing like, Raleigh and Charlotte, Charleston are three of the markets where we're seeing a fair amount of supply have also been some of our best pricing markets so far this year. So as Eric kind of laid out earlier, we're not seeing a lot of pressure yet from supply. We're still getting the job growth and demand. There's, pockets here and there. But right now as we did in Q1, we're happy to keep pushing on price where we can. Our occupancy is at a stable point. And there's, a lot of things we monitor as kind of leading-edge demand indicators but still in a healthy balance right now. Yes. It's fairly consistent, I would say. Atlanta is probably a good example where we have quite a bit of diversification there. We've got several assets kind of in town, Midtown, Buckhead and then a lot of assets outside the perimeter and we're pretty consistently seeing the suburban assets perform better than those more urban assets. And that's playing out relatively consistent across some of the markets. We are seeing, what you might call, our secondary markets perform pretty well. I mentioned Charleston a moment ago. Savannah, Greenville some of these more secondary markets are holding up very well and doing really well in terms of pricing. And that's part of the strategy. I mean, typically those markets aren't going to get quite as much of the supply as some of these larger markets and that's playing out for us pretty well so far. Yeah. Nick it's Tim. So if we think about where April is, it's anywhere from call it negative 1%, negative 2% for some of the lower markets, up to 3%, 4%, 5% on some markets. And it moved positive in April. As we talked about we're at 0.2% and we saw a good acceleration from March to April. We kind of expect to see that typical seasonality and a little more acceleration as we move through the spring and summer, but that gives you a little bit of an order of magnitude. Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned before, Austin is one of the weaker ones. Austin and Phoenix are two that I would point out as a little bit on the weaker side. Orlando continues to be one of our strongest markets. And then I mentioned a moment ago as well we're seeing some of our more secondary markets perform really well. Also Charleston, Savannah, Richmond Greenville all holding up really well also. Sure. Yeah, Atlanta is a little bit of a unique situation. So back in February, we had some winter storms. It affected Texas and Georgia also, but we particularly saw some impact in Atlanta and Georgia. We had about 70 units in Atlanta that were down that we took out of service through the storm and then brought them back up kind of in late February. So you had a pretty good chunky units in Atlanta that we had to get leased up. So that was really the occupancy story there. We've seen it kind of bottomed out in March, but we have seen April occupancy pick up. So I think Atlanta will continue to improve and be a pretty solid market for us later in the year. Yeah. I mean there will be pockets. We're not -- we certainly haven't seen -- don't expect to see it at any sort of portfolio-wide level. If we look at Q1 total concessions were about 25 basis points as a percent of rent. We are seeing a little more in Austin call it half a month up to a month and then there's areas where if there's lease-up properties you may see a little bit more markets like Orlando, we're seeing no concessions, but we'll see it a little bit but I don't think any more than half to a month more than what we're kind of seeing right now. I don't really see it getting much different than what we see today. More so on competing assets. I mean we have some. As I mentioned there's -- it's pretty minimal. And it kind of depends on the market. There are some markets where upfront concessions are more of staying in that market whereas others it's more of a net pricing scenario where you don't really see upfront concessions. So it kind of depends, but similar whether it's our properties or the market in general. Yes Rob, this is Tim. So if we look at Q1, for example, all the rents that we billed in Q1, we collected 99.4% of that, so 60 basis points of bad debt which is consistent right in line with where we were last year. If you factor in prior month collections and any collection agency, it goes down about 50 basis points. So really remains pretty minimal. Atlanta is probably the one I would point out, where it's just still kind of the court system and everything going on there. It's taken a little longer to move through the process. So it's our highest one right now, probably closer to around 1% or so. But that's really the only market where we're seeing that. Yeah. Tayo this is Tim. I mean I think one thing to keep in mind the new lease rates that we saw in Q1 are really pretty typical, if we go back through history. If you look outside of last year the kind of the lease rates we were seeing were pretty much in line or better frankly than most of the years we've been tracking it. So it was pretty much as expected. I mean March new lease rates dropped a little bit and it was really more function of similar to what I was talking about with Atlanta earlier where we saw leasing activity drop for a couple of weeks there in February with some of the stores, particularly in Texas and Georgia that impacted occupancy a little bit in February. And then we were able to regain that occupancy in March but it did come at the expense a little bit of some of the new lease pricing but as we talked about with April where we saw new lease spreads accelerate and move positive. So from where we sit right now all the demand metrics look strong exposures, where we want it leads traffic volume all that is where we would expect. So I think we'll move into the rest of the spring and the summer a strong leasing season and see some acceleration and see what we would typically expect out of a pretty strong supply-demand dynamic. Yes. I think the sequential decline all those Texas markets, I think was pretty much real estate tax relief. Just the timing of accruals and settlements, and all that it can be pretty volatile from quarter-to-quarter, but normalizes over the course of the year. Yes, Eric, this is Tim. I mean, I think, it will kind of boil down to new lease pricing that we see over the late spring and summer will be the ball game in terms of whether it ends up a little better than we thought or a little worse. You have obviously the bulk of the leases happening during that period. And they carry for several months throughout the year. So they have certainly an outsized impact. So if those new lease rates accelerate more then it probably is a little better than we thought, if they accelerate not quite as much probably a little less because renewals are going to be relatively consistent through the rest of the year. Yes, this is Tim. So 11% overall and probably markets you would expect. In terms of in-migration Phoenix is our top market. You have about 18% of move-ins out of the market going into Phoenix. Tampa was another big one at 15%. Charlotte was 13%. Charleston and Savannah were pretty high in there as well. And so those are the biggest drivers. And that's been pretty consistent throughout the last several quarters as the ones that are benefiting the most. Yes. I mean we haven't seen a ton of impact yet. I mean I think certainly the technology sector is getting a lot of publicity and a lot of -- there's layoffs out there but I do think a lot of the other sectors are still in the net hiring position. Austin's one particularly in North Austin where we've seen a little bit of impact from that some of the tech jobs up in North Austin, but at the same time you've got Tesla still planning to expand over the next couple of years there. You've got Oracle moving their headquarters there. So certainly long term in Austin it's a job machine and we feel really good about that. Outside of that we haven't seen a lot. Phoenix been tight a little bit. But again we've got properties there with it's a huge semiconductor plant coming in right there in one of our properties. So there's a little bit of short-term pressure over the next few quarters, but long term feel really good about all of those markets. I mean it's pretty consistent. One we've seen move-outs to buy a house has dropped dramatically. As you would expect with what interest rates have done we've seen our move-outs due to rent increase drop quite a bit as well. The biggest reason for move-outs which is always consistently our largest read to put move-out is just a change in the job and job transfers and that's up a little bit. But it's -- as we've talked to people out on site it's more just people moving for another job as opposed to any significant job losses. So turnover -- it's overall is down a little bit but it's the -- some of the key reasons that we've talked about before and pretty, pretty consistent across markets no matter if larger markets or secondary markets."

            "name": "Al Campbell",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.28 for the quarter was $0.06 above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. About half of this favorability was related to the timing of certain expenses, which are now expected to be incurred over the remainder of the year, primarily related to real estate taxes. Operating fundamentals overall were slightly favorable to expectations for the quarter producing about $0.01 per share of favorability. And the remaining outperformance is related to overhead and net interest costs for the quarter. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection from market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter bringing our investment-grade rating to the A3 or A- level with all three agencies. We expect the favorable ratings to have a growing positive impact on our cost of capital as we work through future debt maturities. During the quarter, we also closed on the settlement of our forward equity agreement providing approximately $204 million net proceeds towards funding our development and other capital needs. We funded $38 million of redevelopment, repositioning and smart home installation costs during the quarter producing solid yields. We also funded just over $65 million of development costs during the quarter toward the projected $300 million for the full year. As Brad mentioned, we expect to start several new deals later this year and early next year, likely expanding our development pipeline to over $1 billion, for which our balance sheet is \u2013 remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with record low leverage, our debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times with over $1.4 billion of combined cash and available capacity under our credit facility with 100% of our debt fixed against rising interest rates for an average of 7.7 years and with minimal near-term debt maturities. And finally in order to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $9.11 per share, which is a $0.03 per share increase. We're also slightly narrowing the full year range to $8.93 and $9.29 per share. Given that the majority of the Q1 same-store outperformance was timing related and the bulk of the leasing season is ahead of us, we are maintaining our same-store guidance ranges as well as all of the key ranges for the year. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Phyllis, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions. Phyllis, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions. Yes. Yes Tayo, that's a good question. As we talked about a little bit, we -- the first quarter obviously we outperformed $0.06 according to our midpoint. And about half of that was timing as I mentioned. It's really some expenses some favorability we had in the first quarter. The bulk of that was real estate taxes that, we still think our full year guidance number is correct, so we'll fill that over the year. So the first $0.03 increase in core FFO was the other items coming through. I would say a-third of that or $0.01 was really operating forms. As Tim mentioned, we were favorable particularly in pricing. It was for the first quarter what we expect. I think we -- if you remember our guidance or our discussion in same guidance was that our pricing expectation for the full year was 3% and the quarter first quarter is 3.9%. So that's a little bit of favorability. But given that, we have the bulk of the leasing season ahead of us a lot of work to be done we just felt like our ranges in our guidance are still where they need to be there. And the other part of the favorability of FFO that flowed through were things below NOI overhead interest and those things. So really the same store was good that we were -- I would call it favorable slightly favorable to on point of what we expected. And we'll wait to see what happens over the next couple of quarters. Yes, this is Al. I can give you some color on that. So right now, we expect that our estimates that we put out in our guidance for property taxes we left that the same. We think we still have a good range that we've got. We did have some favorability in the first quarter on property taxes, as I just mentioned a minute ago but really that's related to the timing of some of the activity. We had some -- the appeals from prior year they come in and the timing can be different year-to-year. We had some wins that we achieved in the first quarter on some of our prior year pills that were good. We got them a little earlier than we thought. We still have a lot of fights both for prior year to go and a lot of the information for this year to come in. So on balance we have about 6.25% growth that we expected for this year. We still -- at the midpoint of our guidance we still think that is right. I would tell you that, we still in terms of current year don't have a lot of information yet. We feel like we have a good view on value but a lot of the information the stubs from the municipalities come out probably mostly in the second quarter. So as we're talking next quarter I should have 60% to 70% knowledge on that. And then the millage rates will come more in the third and even some in the fourth quarter. So we feel like our range is good. I would say that, we've continued -- the pressures coming from Texas, Florida and Georgia that's continuing to be the case as it has been for several years. I would say that, as we move forward into 2024 as they're looking backwards toward this more normalized year hopefully we begin to see some moderation in that line. I think there's some property tax in that for sure, but I mean Tim can answer, as well. But I think overall, we expected the first quarter expenses for all categories together in the company has held to be pretty high in the first quarter. Really, for many of the groupings because of the comparisons for last year, as we saw inflation kind of come into our business more in the second third and fourth quarter last year, we expected our property -- our operating expenses to be high.  Actually, they were 8.3% so where we came out was favorable to our expectations, what we had said as Tim mentioned. So what we would expect to see is some key items, personnel, repair and maintenance begin to moderate as we move back into the second third and fourth quarter of the year, with really the outstanding points of continued pressure being taxes, insurance areas primarily. Does that answer the question? Yes. And that's where you're seeing, some of those items particularly in Texas, where we had the real estate tax prior appeals coming in, that's some of that occurring. I'll just add just quickly that Eric that's a very good point you make that really our target -- long-term target is closer to 4.5 times to 5 times on the EBITDA coverage. I mean, we're providing opportunity right now as Eric mentioned and hopefully they will find those expect to be able to find those. And long term our target is in line with what you mentioned. I'm going to start with it and Tim can give some more details. What I would say primarily is, one, we need to see the bulk of leasing season happen as it comes. So we're providing opportunity to see that and get more information. We're encouraged certainly by what we saw in the first quarter. And I think secondly, the biggest point would be, we do expect to see that seasonality in the most acute if you would in the fourth quarter. That's typically what it is in a normal year. That's sort of what we're expecting. So we could see that new lease pricing be a little more negative in that fourth quarter because the holiday season and demand just really shuts down in that period. So that's what we provided for in our forecast I think at this point. Those are the two big items. I mean I think that expense -- the key components of expenses for the year are personnel, repair and maintenance taxes and insurance. I think we -- the first two we expect to moderate as the year progresses as we talked about and taxes and insurance remaining the biggest items that have the most unknown at this point. So that's ones we're keeping our eye on at this point."

            "name": "Brad Hill",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim and good morning, everyone. While operating fundamentals across our platform have remained consistent as Tim just outlined transaction volume remains muted due to a lack of for-sale inventory on the market. For high-quality well-located properties bidding is strong and available capital is aggressively competing in order to win the bid and put capital to work. This strong relative investor demand coupled with often favorable in-place financing continues to support stronger-than-expected cap rates on closed transactions. Having said that, we believe the need to sell increases as the year progresses and it's likely that more compelling acquisition opportunities will materialize later in the year. Therefore, we have maintained our acquisition forecast for the year, but have pushed the timing back a couple of months. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to support our transaction needs. The properties managed by our lease-up team continue to outperform our original expectations generating higher earnings and creating additional long-term value. To-date our new lease-up properties' performance does not appear to be impacted by increased supply pressures. As Eric mentioned, these properties have achieved rents nearly 11% above our original expectations. During the first quarter, we began pre-leasing at our Novel Daybreak community in Salt Lake City, and early leasing demand is extremely strong with the property currently 11.5% pre-leased at rents well ahead of our expectations. Predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects, four of which should start construction in the back half of 2023: two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. During the first quarter we purchased a Phase 2 land site to our Packing District project in Orlando Florida, bringing our future development projects owned or under construction to 12, representing over 3,300 units. Over the past few months, we have seen an increase in inbound pre-purchase development opportunities due to a substantial decline in the availability of both debt and equity capital for new developments. We remain disciplined and selective in our review process but we are hopeful these calls will lead to additional currently unidentified development opportunities. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027 and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment reflective of the significant slowdown in new starts that we expect to continue to see over the balance of 2023 and 2024. Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our six under construction projects and are doing a tremendous job managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize inflationary and supply chain pressures on our development costs and our schedules. We have two projects that we'll be delivering units during the second quarter Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City, which delivered six units late in the first quarter and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And with that I'll turn it over to Al. Yeah. Hey. Austin, this is Brad. We really haven't seen any impact negative impact associated with supply pressures on our new lease-ups. And generally that's where you'd think we would see it first. We've got six or so projects that are in lease-up right now. Concessions on those we typically model about a month free. I'd say on three of those we're using some concession maybe up to 0.5 month free. We're not using the full concessions that we underwrote and we're not seeing the need to just generally, based on what we're seeing in the market. And I'd say our traffic continues to be really good on all of our lease-ups. The leases we're signing the velocity is really, really good. So we're not seeing any early indications yet, but that new supply is having an impact there. Yeah, this is Brad. I'll certainly jump on that. We continue to see cap rates call it in the 4.7, 4.75 range for assets that fit that description well located strong markets. Interestingly in the first quarter, I mean, we only had seven data points. So again, it's -- the volume is down call it 70% year-over-year. So we don't have a whole lot of data points. But interestingly the band of those seven trades is pretty close together so -- which we haven't seen that historically. I would say for us cap rates definitely need to be over 5, 5.25, 5.5 something in that range. But I would say it's really going to depend on the asset what the rent trajectory looks like. And we're also looking at the after CapEx what it looks like in that nature as well. So that's pretty important to us. And I would say where opportunities might come for us are going to be properties that are early in their lease-up. That's where some of these developers tend to get a little bit more stress in their underwriting and in their performance. As some of the supply in our markets begins to come online some of these less experienced operators that are operating some of these new lease-ups could potentially struggle a bit to lease up those assets. And so I do think that's going to be an opportunity for us. And in fact that's really what our acquisition forecast is built on is buying assets that are in their initial stage of lease-up. Yeah. I mean most of our partners use bank financing for their developments. And so I'd say that's the biggest concern at this point. And given the last few weeks and just the restriction there in capital with banks, it's more acute than it has been. First quarter, it was difficult. Equity was difficult. Debt was difficult. And I'd say the debt piece has gotten even more difficult for them. But generally, they're going to regional banks for their banking needs. And they generally have strong relationships with these banks, so they can get a deal or two done with the banks but it's a lot more difficult. It takes a lot longer than what it has in the past. And so that's really restricting. One of the other areas that it's restricting new deals getting done and I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future. Yes Rob, this is Brad. As I mentioned we have 12 sites now that we either own or control. So we feel like we're in a good spot in terms of building out our pipeline going forward. And as Al mentioned, we think we're on pace for that $1 billion $1.2 billion or so in terms of projects going and we like where we're located. The asset that we purchased in Orlando is a Phase two to a project that we'll start this year. So there was a strategic reason for that. It's really a covered land play. There's some leased buildings on it right now. So, I'd say going forward, we'll be a bit more cautious on land. I would say, we'll continue to look for sites that have been dropped by other developers. We'll look to get time. A couple of the sites we have now, as I mentioned, are we control them we do not own them. So that's our preference to have time on the deals. And I'd say we're on the early stages or it appears that we're in the early stages of land repricing a bit in some areas. We've seen a 10% price reduction on some of the projects that some of the -- our partners are coming to us with sites for. They've been able to negotiate some additional time and some cost reduction. So I think we're on the early stages of that at this point. This is Brad. I definitely think that that is something to keep an eye on. I do think the market down there right now is extremely tough. And depending on where you are in Tampa or South Florida, those insurance premiums are increasing substantially for new product. So I would say, for newly developed properties in those areas Tampa, Orlando not as much, but Jacksonville, it's something for us to keep an eye on, because I do think that the insurance premiums are going to be a lot higher than the developer underwrote than they expected. And I do think there's going to be some impact to the sales proceeds as a part of that. And so I think as you get some of the supply pressures coupled with that and some of the leasing pressures those are areas that we'll keep an eye on. And then obviously, we have the benefit with our broader portfolio and insurance pricing that that definitely is a platform benefit for us. Yes. I mean, I don't think that we are seeing any distress in the market right now. I mean the projects just like our portfolio the operating fundamentals are very strong. So even on some of these lease-ups when they underwrote them in 2021 or so the leasing fundamentals are going to be a lot stronger than what they expected. And even the joint venture projects that we started in 2021 cap rates were in the 5%, 5.5% range on the valuation. I mean, that's kind of where we are. So, I would say that the developers have been somewhat disciplined in their underwriting in the last couple of years and the operating fundamentals are outperforming. So, they won't get the pricing that they could have gotten 1.5 years ago, but there's still profit in a lot of these projects, so we're not seeing that yet. Where I think the distress could come are projects that closed a year, 1.5 years ago and they did some type of financing cap or something that's coming due and it's going to require a reset of -- or a pay down in order to get that loan rightsized and the debt service coverage rightsized. Those are going to be the ones I think that are going to have a little bit of trouble."

During management's prepared comments, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today Thursday, October 31, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening remarks.\nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Julianne, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo, Clay Holder, and Rob DelPriore. Before being with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe Risk Factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial debt. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Third quarter results for core FFO were ahead of our expectations as same-store NOI came in better than our forecast. Based on our analysis, we believe that peak deliveries of new supply that is impacting our sub-markets and properties occurred this past third quarter. Despite this record-high supply pressure in Q3, we were able to capture solid performance in occupancy, record low resident turnover, strong collections and better than expected performance with operating expenses, which all contributed to the third quarter NOI results. In addition, as Tim will detail in his comments, we are beginning to see early trends with new lease pricing that support our position that the worst of the pressures on pricing from new supply are likely behind us. As we have been discussing for the past year or so, we are now poised to see moderating trends in the amount of new supply deliveries that are impacting our portfolio as we head into 2025. We expect to see normal seasonal leasing patterns for the next couple of quarters and remain convinced that the spring leasing season will usher in the start of a recovery cycle with more favorable leasing conditions as demand and absorption trends across our markets remain strong and the volume of new supply deliveries steadily declines. With strengthening leasing conditions, significant redevelopment opportunity in our existing portfolio and meaningful efficiency gains from various new technology initiatives, we are excited about the upside outlook from our asset base. This momentum coupled with the significant expansion of our external growth pipeline from our in house new development projects, our prepurchase joint venture program and our recent new property acquisitions all combined for what we believe is a positive outlook for meaningful value growth. Before turning the call over to Brad, I'd like to send my appreciation out to our MAA associates for their tremendous work and great results over this very busy third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. MAA's long-term strategy of focusing on high-growth markets and diversifying within those markets uniquely positions our portfolio to benefit from the continued strong demand in our footprint. As an attractive, more-affordable alternative to much of the higher priced new multifamily supply being delivered as well as the available single-family housing options, our residents are choosing to stay with us longer, with only 11.5% of our move-outs occurring due to residents buying a home. Our customer service is reflected in our Google Scores, which continues to lead the sector, supports our strong renewals and record low turnover rate. With our 60 day exposure, which represents all current vacancies and notices over the next 60 days, 30 basis points better than last year and new deliveries poised to decline, our communities are well positioned for the seasonally slower months and for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in the spring summer of 2025. Throughout this year, we've continued to make progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In the third quarter, we added two new projects to our under construction development pipeline, bringing our total under construction developments to eight projects, representing 2,762 units at a cost of approximately $978 million a record level of development for MAA. In addition to the previously disclosed 239 unit Charlotte project, where we provided financing to take out the equity partner on an under construction community, we also closed and started construction on a 360, excuse me, 306 unit community in Richmond and Virginia in the third quarter. The Richmond project was a fully entitled, shovel ready development that we took over from a developer who was unable to obtain financing. The Charlotte project should deliver first units in the third quarter of 2025 and we expect the Richmond project to deliver first units in first quarter of 2027. We expect to start construction on one more project during the fourth quarter, bringing our total development starts for the year to five at a cost of $508 million, exceeding our original guidance for the year. We expect these projects to deliver an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 6.3%. With our development pipeline approaching $1 billion, our focus turns to maintaining our pipeline at this level going forward. Pre-development work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which now includes 10 projects, representing future growth of over 2,800 units at an expected cost of $1.1 billion. We have seen some construction cost declines in a few markets and remain hopeful that as the total under construction pipeline in our markets continues its steep decline, we could see further improvement in construction cost and schedules as well as we get into 2025, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields. In the transaction market, volume remains relatively low with cap rates trending down into the high 4% range. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities at pricing the market cap rates, generally in lease up and often on an off market basis. In the third quarter, we closed on a 310 unit suburban property in Orlando for approximately $84 million approximately 10% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is nearly stabilized at just under 90% occupancy. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a closed on a 386 unit mid-rise property in the Knox Henderson area of Dallas at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. This property just wrapped up construction and is in its initial lease up. This brings our total acquisition volume for the year to just over $270 million at an average stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%. Our team is actively evaluating other acquisition opportunities and we are hopeful, we'll close another compelling acquisition before year end. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold a 216 unit property in Charlotte, North Carolina for $39 million and we have an additional property in Richmond, Virginia under contract to sell with an expected closing during the fourth quarter. We have two more properties in Columbia, South Carolina on the market with a likely closing in early 2025. Before I turn the call over to Tim, I want to echo Eric's comments to our associates. Thank you for your hard work and dedication during this busy third quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim.\nTim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As noted by both Eric and Brad, various demand metrics we track remain strong, partially mitigating the impact of new supply deliveries that we believe peaked in the third quarter. 60 day exposure is better than at any point over the last five years. The seasonal deceleration of Middle East pricing is less than the prior year and pre-COVID periods and absorption remains strong. However, pricing growth particularly on new leases continues to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but as noted showed less seasonal deceleration than we typically see this time of the year. For the third quarter, new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis was minus 5.4%, just a 30 basis point decline from the second quarter compared to a 270 basis point decline over the same period last year. In fact, 10 of our top 15 highest concentration markets showed new lease-over-lease growth acceleration from the second to third quarter. Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong growing [Technical Difficulty] lease-over-lease basis. These two components resulted in lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis of minus 0.2%, also a 30 basis point decline from the second quarter and compared to a 220 basis point decline over the same period last year. Average physical occupancy was 95.7%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter, demonstrating the strong absorption in our markets. Collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.4% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same store revenue that was in line with the third quarter of 2023. Along with the demand metrics noted, our unique market diversification strategy that Brad mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. As we have mentioned previously, several of our mid-tier markets are holding up better in this higher supply environment. Savannah, Richmond, Charleston, Greenville and our Fredericksburg and our other Northern Virginia properties are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Particularly in a down cycle, our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets helped strengthen overall portfolio performance. Also as has been the case all year, Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets with Austin being the toughest challenge of all the markets. We continue to execute on our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives, where it makes sense in this elevated supply environment with the expectation of starting to reaccelerate next year. For the third quarter of 2024, we completed over 1,700 interior unit upgrades, achieving rate increases of $108 above non-upgraded units. We are encouraged by the strength of this program in this competitive environment demonstrated by the fact that these units lease quicker on average than a non-renovated unit when adjusted for the additional turn time. For our repositioning program, we have two active projects that are in the repricing phase with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional six projects underway with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in the spring of 2025, in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment. As we wrap up, October, we are seeing normal seasonal moderation but are encouraged by demand that should continue to keep the sequential seasonal pricing deceleration better than historical trends. Our 60 day exposure of 6.3% should serve to keep occupancy stable and allow for more pricing power than last year, as we also start to lap new lease pricing that weakened significantly during the fourth quarter of last year. Absorption remains strong in our markets with the third quarter representing the first time since the first quarter of 2022 that units absorbed exceeded units delivered. Therefore, there is not a significant backlog of inventory needing to be absorbed. Accordingly, October new lease pricing is within 10 basis points of September new lease pricing, demonstrating this demand and our expectation of less seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter than we normally experience. Furthermore, lease-over-lease rates on accepted renewals for November and December in the 4.25 range. We will only reprice approximately 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter, which minimizes the impact of this moderation on the portfolio. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply deliveries continue to be a headwind in many of our markets. However, we still believe the near-term outlook is in line with what we have discussed last few quarters. That is we expect this new supply will begin to moderate and that we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease-over-lease pricing growth and that the supply-demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. At a portfolio level, construction starts in our footprint peaked in mid-2022 and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction start. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.\nClay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.21 per share, which was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Just under $0.03 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses, with an additional $0.02 driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense and non-operating income. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were relatively in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, same-store revenues benefited from strong occupancy during the quarter. Our same-store expense performance, particularly real estate taxes was favorable compared to our guidance for the quarter. We've received property valuations for our Florida portfolio, which were lower than our expectations. Repairs and maintenance costs continue to show moderation, growing at 2% compared to third quarter last year. During the quarter, we funded nearly $167 million of development cost of the current $978 million pipeline, leaving an expected $368 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two to three years. We also invested approximately $13 million of capital through our redevelopment and repositioning programs during the quarter, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains solid. We ended the quarter with just over $800 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.9x. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average maturity of seven years at an effective rate of 3.8%. Finally, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year, while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the third quarter, we are slightly adjusting the midpoint of effective rent growth guidance by 15 basis points to 0.35% and revising total same-store revenue guidance for the year to 0.5% at the midpoint. With property valuations for our Florida portfolio now known, we have more insight into our overall real estate tax expense for 2024, and are lowering the midpoint of our guidance to 2%. This results in the lowering of our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 3.75% at the midpoint. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results in reaffirming our original midpoint expectation for same-store NOI at minus 1.3%. In addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we are revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. These adjustments combined with the $0.02 to $0.03 of estimated impact of clean-up cost related to storms in the fourth quarter resulted in us to maintain the midpoint of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share, while narrowing the range to $8.80 to $8.96 per share. Including the fourth quarter, we estimate our 2024 results will include approximately $0.08 to $0.09 of total storm clean-up costs compared to $0.01 of cost included in our initial 2024 guidance. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Julianne, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: I guess just to start, can you talk about your 4Q expectations for blended rent growth and occupancy? You may have run through them, but I think it went kind of quickly. I don't know that I got it all. But I guess just trying to figure out, if you think about year-end occupancy, you sounded pretty positive on demand and on renewals. So just what do you think in the year end and how 4Q looks for occupancy and blends?\nTim Argo : Jamie, this is Tim. Yes, I think, in terms of occupancy pretty consistent with where we are right now. We're at 95.4% currently. I think 95.4% to 95.5% for Q4 is a range we're comfortable with, particularly with where we see exposure right now. As I mentioned in my comments, the renewal rates that we're getting for November and December in the 4.25% range, so call it 4% to 4.5% for the fourth quarter in terms of renewals. And then, on new lease pricing, we mentioned the new lease pricing for October moderated only about 10 basis points from September. It was 6.9% in September, 7% in October. I think you see a little bit of moderation from here but not much and see less deceleration than we typically do as we commented in the call.\nJamie Feldman: And then, I mean, guidance -- full year guidance now seemed conservative when you first gave it. As we think about '25, I mean, is there still a lot of juice to get on the expense side that could help you with efficiencies or anything else, or do you think you get back to more of a normalized growth rate?\nTim Argo : Yes. I think just kind of thinking through the expense structure, I mean, starting with real estate tax expenses and insurance. The growth that we've seen in real estate tax expenses of about 2%. Yes, I believe that will be a little tough to repeat that level at next year. I would think that, that would get some more of a normalized growth rate, call it, somewhere between 3% and 4%. But I believe that, that would be appropriate for real estate taxes insurance. We had the slight decrease in our premium renewal this past July. And so, we'll get that for the first half of next year and then we'll have to reprice in July of next year. It's hard to say at this point where that's going to ultimately end up. I don't think it gets back to the levels of increases that we saw over the past couple of years, but also don't think it's going to be flat either. So somewhere in the 5% to 10% range, keeping in mind that insurance is just a small piece of our overall expense debt. And then, regards to personnel costs, I think that continues to moderate a little bit. And as we get some of these inflationary impacts behind us, some more things for repair and maintenance. We've talked about some of the moderation we've seen this past year in repair and maintenance. I don't know that we'll be back at that level, in 2025, but I think it will also be more of a reasonable growth rate, something around 3% to 3.5%. Marketing expenses, I think would be the other one to call out that continue may run a little high at the first half of the year, but I would expect that to come back down, as we comp some of these increases that we've seen this past year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Dennerlein: I'm just kind of curious, is there any way to kind of quantify like the impact of, like, the deliveries on that new lease rate growth? Are there any good examples of markets where you didn't really have supply pressure and maybe just how the new lease rate growth trended in those markets versus more supply heavy markets?\nClay Holder: Yes. There are a couple of markets. Austin, as we've talked about all year, continues to be our most-challenging market and we saw new lease rates in Austin pick up in a negative way quite a bit from Q2 to Q3. We saw a little bit in Raleigh. But I think the point as far as Q3 is concerned, it was pretty targeted to a couple of markets. I made a comment in the prepared comments that out of our 15 highest concentration markets, we actually saw 10 of those 15 new lease rates accelerate. And so, actually if you pull out -- if you focus on just Austin and pull that -- pull the new lease rates in Austin out of both the Q2 and Q3 numbers, we actually would have seen new lease rate from Q2 to Q3 accelerate about 10 basis points, as opposed to a 30 basis point decline. Certainly, Austin was a big driver. Atlanta continues to be a struggle, but obviously, we feel really good about Austin long-term and it's just working through a lot of supply but it did have an outsized impact on what we saw with new lease rates.\nJosh Dennerlein: And then, in those higher-supply markets, were those also skewing renewal rates down as well? Because do you have like a similar status for renewal if you like strip out Austin for the high supply markets?\nClay Holder: Yes. I mean, it impacts renewals to some extent. If you think about for the third quarter, renewals were what somewhere in the 4% range, 4.1%. Austin was 1.5% to give you some perspective on that. It does tend to impact renewal rates a little bit but we certainly see much stronger renewal spreads than we do even for some of those more challenging markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDaniel Tricarico: Hi, good morning, guys. It's Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. I want to clarify how you're thinking about this peaking of supply ultimately impacting market rent growth next year. I'm obviously not talking guidance, but there's obviously still a lot of units to absorb. So just curious how you'd see that relative change in supply impacting the seasonal curve in market rents in those higher supply markets?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, as we've talked about supply definitely peaked sort of the mid to second, third quarter of 2022 and that's pretty consistent across all our markets. Some of them lagged or were ahead of that maybe a quarter or so, but pretty consistent. And as we talked about we think about two years from start is when we see the maximum amount of pressure, which is kind of about right now and what we saw in Q3. I think we'll see a little bit of moderating pressure in Q4 won't necessarily show up with seasonal moderation and just less traffic, less leases expiring. So I think as we get into the spring and summer, I would expect, we'll see normal seasonality just like we would any other period, but start to see some strength particularly on the new lease side, as demand picks up seasonally and as the impact of the moderating supply, which we think in general supply is probably down 20% or so in 2025 as compared to 2024. So should start to see that strength, as we get into the spring.\nDaniel Tricarico: And then can you just quantify what your -- what you'd expect the loss to lease and revenue earning to be at the end of the year?\nTim Argo : Yes. I think in terms of earn-in, if you think about our blended lease-over-lease expectations for full year of 2024, it's somewhere in that negative 3% range and half of that if not a little more carries over into 2025 which kind of drives the earn-in. So, slightly negative call it 20 basis points, 30 basis points somewhere in that range where we sit right now in terms of earn-in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Absorption was clearly a positive in the quarter. Do you assume that elevated absorption levels continue through the remainder of the year, level of demand is baked into guidance? And have you seen traffic or conversion levels move or change as we've moved into the slower leasing season?\nTim Argo : I'm not sure I caught all of that but I know you were asking about absorption initially. I mean, yes, we don't see any reason for absorption to go backwards. I mean, if you look at absorption so far this year, Q1 was a record high for any first quarter since we've been tracking it. Q2 was the highest absorption since early 2021. And Q3 as I mentioned saw us actually absorb more units than we delivered for the first time since Q1 in 2022. We don't see anything on the demand side that's moderating. I mean, you think about job growth, household formation, population growth, move-outs to buy a home, we expect turnover to continue to stay low. So I think demand will hold up strong and as supply starts to moderate, which we think it will, I would expect absorption to be as good if not better as we look into 2025.\nMichael Goldsmith: And as a follow-up and I'll try to streamline the guidance better, but just how are concession levels trending for merchant developer lease up properties? Are you offering any concession at stabilized properties? And maybe just can you frame the price differential if there is any between the typical MAA property and the new developments?\nTim Argo : Yes. I mean, broadly concessions in Q3 were pretty consistent with Q2. I mean, it's pretty standard in a lot of markets that you're seeing on in a stabilized submarket half a month to a month, something like that. Now we are seeing in lease-up areas a little more than that, and it's the markets I mentioned, particularly Austin and Atlanta. In Austin, you're seeing up to three months when you think about Central Austin and Georgetown area and then particularly in Midtown Atlanta seeing up to three months. So I'll call out those two kind of submarket markets as the highest concessionary environment but pretty consistent with what it's been in most of our other markets. But we are still seeing, if we look at the new supply being delivered on aggregate, it's about anywhere from $250 to $300 higher price point than our average portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern : Obviously, leverage is still well below the long-term target and it seems like you're seeing a lot of opportunities, both on the acquisition and development fronts. Does it make sense to grow at this point using mainly leverage to get metrics back into the target range? Or do you want to save that capacity for something bigger?\nClay Holder : Yes. Right now, that's kind of where we're leaning into. I mean, when we look at our cost of equity versus our cost of debt, right now, we're actually trading at probably a slight discount. So we're going to probably lean more into the debt side versus the equity for the time being. But as things begin to change and we expect to get a little bit more benefit there on the equity side at some point, and we'd probably lean a little bit more in that direction when the time is right.\nBrad Heffern : And then I think I heard you say 3% gain to lease earlier on the call, correct me if I'm wrong, but I would think that, that will weigh on new lease spreads in '25. I'm just curious, big picture, when you think we might see those actually turn positive.\nTim Argo : We didn't say 3%. I think our gain to lease right now, looking at -- if you look at where October rents or October leases compared to in-place rents, it's about 0.7% gain to lease, which is not too unusual this time of year with seasonal pricing starts to decelerate some seasonally, so it's not a big number for us right now. I think what we did talk about was just kind of the earn-in being slightly negative headed into 2025. And then I would expect we see better new lease pricing in 2025 as compared to what we saw in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Two questions here. First, just based on your responses to a lot of the other analysts, it sounds like, one, Atlanta and Austin are the only two markets of supply concern. And then two, it sounds like your comments around strengthening '25 and being in a better leasing position is predicated on the current run rate of absorption, meaning like even though you expect absorption rates to improve, your comments around expectations of leasing for '25 aren't predicated on improving absorptions based on the current trend.\nTim Argo : Yes. I would say your second point is right. I mean, we're -- we would expect to see consistent demand, certainly consistent, if not a little bit better absorption but where we think and we'd like to see that play out is more on rates and more new lease rates as opposed to trying to get occupancy to 96% or 96.5%, something like that we would prefer to focus on rates. To your first point, I mean, I wouldn't say that we're the only ones feeling supply pressure. Those are certainly feeling more supply pressure. I mean, most of our markets are getting more supply than what we would call a typical market but holding up a little better, given where the supply is occurring relative to our markets and demand and all that. So we're certainly in a more elevated supply picture, but also in Atlanta are ones that stand out a little bit. But I think those start to get better next year as do most of our other markets.\nEric Bolton : I think it's -- Alex, this is Eric. I think it's important to just recap what Tim said earlier is that of our 15 largest markets, 10 of those actually saw new lease-over-lease pricing improve in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. And if you take just Austin out of the mix and just exclude Austin from our Q2 and Q3 performance trends on new lease pricing, our new lease pricing in Q3 would have been up 10 basis points from where it was in Q2. So Austin clearly is having an outsized impact on the portfolio right now. We feel great about that market long-term. But certainly in 2024, it's weighing on the performance of the portfolio as a whole, given just the absolute level of supply that came into that one market.\nAlexander Goldfarb : The second question just revolves around the hurricane. Obviously some big storms. As you guys assess your portfolio because it's incredible, the REITs never really seem to have any major damage, is it a matter of either, one, you guys really only buy properties or invest in properties that are away from rivers, are away from shore lines are elevated? Or is it some of the steps you're taking? Or why is it that we see some devastation but then when the REITs report like you guys, the damage is minimum? Just trying to understand if that's active management on your part as far as how you select the properties and where geographically you're keeping or if there's something else that worked?\nRobert DelPriore : It's Rob. I think it's really a combination of factors. I think part of it is the selection of the sites and what we're building. But ultimately, it's the ongoing repair and maintenance that we're spending on the properties, making sure that the roofs are relatively new, they're intact and the preparation we do before the storms come in really assist with minimizing our damage. So it really is only cleanup that we're stuck with and kind of some landscaping and other smaller things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste : Can you talk a bit about the transaction market and the opportunities coming across your desk? It seems like more sellers willing to engage with cap rates down to 5% and even sub-5% as you noted. So as you guys look at the opportunities coming across your desk, what are the key items or non-negotiables you're seeking? Is it newer assets with operational upside as you talked about previously? And then maybe some color on the compelling, I think was the word used, opportunities that you're looking at here potentially closing by year-end? Is that a comment on the size, value creation, IRR potential? What's so compelling? Some color would be appreciated.\nBrad Hill: Haendel, this is Brad. I mean, generally, relative to the compelling comment that really is similar to what we're investing in today. And if you look at the stabilized NOI yields of the three acquisitions we've had this year at 5.9% relative to where current market cap rates are, those are pretty compelling returns, I would say. Really, what we're focused on and where we're finding our opportunities are on properties that are generally brand new. Most times they are just finishing up their initial lease-up -- or excuse me, just finishing up construction and just entering in their initial lease-up. It's assets that are tougher for other folks to get financed. But given our ability to close all cash, we have some competitive advantage versus others in the market. There's also opportunities for us to put our operating platform on these assets to drive additional returns that many other folks can't do. Oftentimes, we're looking for properties that are in proximity to current assets that we have, where we're able to plot those properties and really generate additional returns. So those are kind of the competitive angles that we're looking for where we're able to generate additional returns. And then the last point I would just make is generally, a lot of what we're doing is off-market. We have extensive relationships in this region of the country exclusively operating for 30 years. About 80% of the $2 billion that we purchased over the last 10 years have been with merchant developers. So we have extensive relationships that we're able to lean on that allow us to -- the opportunity to execute at returns that often exceed what the market rates are.\nHaendel St. Juste : And just going back to development pipeline for a moment now up to over $1 billion, I think you mentioned, and with a sizable opportunity beyond that with the shadow pipeline, I guess I'm curious how large could that development pipeline included near-term, how aggressive could you be given the [inaudible] that you see into '26? And then maybe some color on [inaudible] likely to be started next? And how you're thinking about underwriting the rent growth in those markets in the next couple of years?\nBrad Hill: Yes. If I forget something in that question, please let me know. But yes, I mean, in terms of the size of the development pipeline, we've commented for a couple of years now really a desire to build that pipeline to $1 billion, $1.2 billion total size. Today, we're just under $1 billion so we've got a little bit of room to grow that a little bit. That would equate to about three to four starts a year in over a three year period, which is really the time line it takes for most of these projects that gets us to our $1 billion, $1.2 billion. So that's really -- we're very comfortable, given the size of our balance sheet of really maintaining our pipeline at that level. And clearly, given what we think are going to be strong operating fundamentals in '26, '27, this is a great time for us to be ramping up that development pipeline to that $1 billion, $1.2 billion level. In terms of how we're underwriting these projects very conservatively, the developments that we have delivering today on average, even in this high supply environment, we're exceeding our underwriting on average by about 50 basis points. So we underwrite very conservatively. Very little trending in rents for the first few years. And typically, you get to year three, year four, you start trending a little bit more. We're trending our expenses the entire hold period. So that's generally how we underwrite our deals but on a very conservative basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.\nBuck Horne : I just wanted to follow-up on that. Just thinking about the Richmond asset in terms of the start there, as you're rebuilding the development pipeline, thinking about new -- or your large markets versus mid-tier markets, would you expect to kind of restock and maybe look at more development opportunities in those mid-tier markets? And I'm kind of wondering what the differential in yields might be to do a development in a larger market versus a mid-tier market right now.\nBrad Hill: Buck, this is Brad. Yes, I mean, we definitely believe in our strategy of allocating capital between both large markets and these mid-tier markets. So we are very much committed to continuing to growing our presence and allocating capital both through acquisitions and development in some of these mid-tier markets. And really, it's been a function of just where the opportunities have come. So we haven't seen as many opportunities, given the lower level of supply in some of these mid-tier markets but we are seeing some of those opportunities. Now, we acquired the Raleigh project earlier this year, the development here in Richmond. So you'll see us continue to have a focus in those mid-tier markets. I would say from a stabilized yield perspective, there's maybe 10 basis points, 20 basis points difference in today's rate. So Richmond's close to 6.5% and some of the other projects are maybe 6.25%, 6.3%. So there's not a big swing in terms of some of the yields for these projects. But really, that is going to manifest itself maybe a little bit on IRRs where we're getting higher IRRs on the projects in the secondary markets as the exit cap rates may be a little bit different. But that's really the only difference in terms of the underwriting projects.\nBuck Horne : Second question, with some of these new mandates coming out for return to office, I know it's maybe not as big in Sunbelt markets, but have you seen any changes or shifts recently in terms of traffic re-leasing patterns in urban locations versus suburban locations that might be affected by certain return to office policies?\nTim Argo : Mike, this is Tim. Nothing that we've seen at a material level. I mean, we did see -- we talked about performance between A and B assets in urban, suburban. We did see that narrow a little bit with our urban properties performing a little bit better. I'm not sure that's necessarily related to anything return to office but we did see a little bit of performance there. But broadly speaking, not seeing a lot of shift in any of the metrics that we track.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.\nEric Wolfe: As you get ready to give guidance next year, I guess what will you be looking at over the next couple of months to determine your view on market rent growth or blended spreads for next year? I think you said new leases might be down like 7% or 8% in November and December. Does that even weigh into your view? Does it not really matter? Just wondering what we should be looking at to kind of understand what market rent growth should be like next year.\nTim Argo : Yes, this is Tim. I mean, I think new lease pricing is the key metric that we're looking at in terms of -- it's not going to -- what happens in the rest of this quarter is not going to be impactful necessarily to 2024, but it does have some impact to some extent on earn-in and where we start the year. Occupancy, we think will be relatively stable and so it's going to [inaudible] and we think renewals will continue to be stable. They've been in that 4% to 5% range all throughout this year so we don't expect to see that change necessarily. So it will come down to the new lease rates and sort of where those -- how those play out and then we'll have more to say as we get into Q4 earnings release. But certainly, sitting here today compared to where we were 12 months ago, I feel a lot better both in just macroeconomic variables. Recession risk is down. There's a little more certainty there. We know supply is starting to moderate and so feel pretty good that sets up for a little bit better year. I mean, it's still going to be elevated supply. And even in a normal environment, new lease rates in Q1 and Q4 are typically negative so we don't expect that necessarily to change. But we do expect to see a little more positive momentum in terms of new lease pricing when we get into Q2 and Q3.\nEric Bolton : Yes, the other thing that I'll add to that quickly on top of Tim's comment is that don't forget what Tim mentioned in that we intentionally only have about 16% of our leases expiring in the fourth quarter. And then you consider that roughly a good percentage of those are going to renew as a renewal transaction versus a new lease transaction. So the overall impact on earn-in from new lease performance between now and the end of the year is not as significant as you might think it is, given the low percentage of leases set to expire and the split between renewal and new lease pricing that will take place.\nEric Wolfe: And then I guess, are there any other items that we should be thinking about when it comes to your revenue growth potential next year? I know I sometimes ask about this other income, but I think you've been studying the Wi-Fi cable program. So I was curious if that might pick up next year, if that's maybe an opportunity more for like 2026 and 2027.\nTim Argo : Yes. I mean, you called out one that can start to have an impact. I mean, we're testing or retrofitting four properties this year that are just now starting to go live that have that property-wide ubiquitous Wi-Fi, if you will. And so if you think about those four properties by themselves is once it's fully rolled out and kind of flows through the portfolio is close to $1 million. So you can start to extrapolate the opportunities that we have there. We expect to expand that pretty significantly next year, initially looking at maybe 20 to 25 properties that we do in 2025. So on the revenue side that would be one that I'd call out. We're wrapping up the smart installations at the last few properties now. There'll be a little bit of tailwind from that in 2025, but other than rent growth and stable occupancy, I think the Wi-Fi starts to slowly have a bit of an impact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim : As far as hurricane and storm-related costs, you don't exclude or add back those costs to get to your core FFO, which I think is a really standout policy versus maybe some of your peers. But going forward, will you be including a larger assumed expense in your guidance as you look to 2025? And how do you think about exposure in some of these markets like Tampa?\nClay Holder : Yes, John, this is Clay. So I think whenever you kind of look at what the cost that we had -- that we were projecting for the full year this year, it's going to be somewhere around $10 million, $9 million, $10 million call it. When you look back at over the, call it, past seven years, six, seven years, we haven't had anything of this magnitude that we've had to deal with. And it's been spread across each quarter this year. It hasn't been just one quarter or one storm. It's been multiple storms impacting us throughout the year. So I think as we look towards next year, that's not something we've traditionally done in the past as far as including some storm cost in our guidance, but we did include $0.01 in our guidance this past year [inaudible] earnings back in February and then released our 2024 guidance in February. So we reflected that but that's the only cost that we reflected in our guidance. But as we look forward to next year, I think that you expect to see something in there. It will not be at the levels that we experienced this year just because history has shown that that's the norm. But I would expect it will include something in our guidance to account for that.\nJohn Kim : And then does it make you think differently about some of your Florida exposure? I know you just purchased something in Orlando. But as far as Tampa and maybe some other markets where insurance cost could be pretty significant?\nClay Holder : Well the one that's -- the insurance cost in Florida gets a lot of publicity. Of course, one thing you have to consider is just our overall portfolio and that we're able to defer a little bit of that risk across all of our markets, not just in the Florida market. So we're still committed to Florida. Yes, there's some higher costs related to insurance there but just given our size and portfolio of our platform that we have across the portfolio, we can still take advantage of some opportunities there.\nJohn Kim : And just to clarify, you do exclude these costs from same-store expense but do you keep those effective properties in the same-store pool?\nClay Holder : Yes. We -- you got to think over these -- the damage that we've seen has been extremely moderate, so damage is probably a strong word. It's more of a cleanup that we see whenever we -- these properties are typically impacted. If you do have a property that was significantly damaged, lost a number of units that had to -- that would not be able to be occupied, we would probably remove that property from same-store while it was being repaired and put back into service. So we'll treat that particular property as appropriate based on our general policy of how we include stores and same-store versus non-same store. But to your point, these cleanup costs, we've reflected those as non-same store costs in our earnings calls, we don't want it to impact the comparability of the same-store portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Blouin from Goldman Sachs.\nJulien Blouin : I just want to make sure I heard a couple of numbers correctly. So the earn-in going into next year about negative 30 basis points and then gain to lease currently around negative 70 basis points. And then with -- my real sort of question here is with new lease spreads down 7% in October, do you still think we can get to sort of positive new lease spreads by spring, early summer? It just seems like quite the ramp to get there.\nTim Argo : Yes. To answer your first question, you have those numbers correct. That is what we stated. As far as new lease rates, we'll talk more about this, obviously, in our next quarter earnings. Difficult to say right now exactly where it will get to. We're kind of going through our budgeting planning process now. I think one point to make is through this year, our best new lease pricing was about negative 4%, negative 4.2%, something like that in July. We certainly expect to exceed that. And to reiterate a point I made earlier, in normal supply demand environments, Q1, Q4, typically negative new lease pricing anyway. So it's really Q2 and Q3 where you start to see it go positive. So more to come on that but we certainly believe all of the factors, supply and demand point to much better new lease performance in '25 than '24.\nRobert DelPriore : And of course, the prior year comparisons factor into this as well.\nTim Argo : That's right.\nJulien Blouin : Yes. On those sorts of comparisons, it does feel like the comparisons get a lot easier year-over-year in November and December, given just the new lease deceleration in concessions we saw last year. So if the worst of supply pressure is behind us and October held steady versus September, why wouldn't that sort of new lease spread begin to improve sequentially into November and December?\nTim Argo : Well, we'll see and it might. We certainly don't expect it to get much worse for all the reasons we've laid out, including those easier comps. It's always new lease is certainly the tip of the spear and can change on a dime. But we feel comfortable it's going to stay in this range, if not start to improve a little bit. But the other point is just there's not much leases as we mentioned, 16% and frankly not a lot of traffic, particularly when you get into mid-November on through December just with holidays, just not a lot of people searching. So it's not going to have a material impact one way or the other but it could -- we could see us sort of hanging in where it is right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer : I just wanted to ask about kind of the portfolio opportunity out there. I think you've talked a little bit about kind of the one-off acquisition opportunities and clearly seeing you guys be a little bit more acquisitive there. But are you seeing any change in terms of kind of sellers of portfolios out there? We've seen some large portfolios trade recently. Is that something that maybe you guys can take advantage of? Or is the pricing there not kind of what you're looking for?\nBrad Hill: Adam, this is Brad. I mean, generally, what we see on portfolios is a lot of times, the quality of the assets are not what we're looking for. There's some type of bad with the good, so to speak. In some of the portfolios that we've seen recently, I mean, frankly, part of that has been pricing. Some of the pricing on those assets were more aggressive than what we believed was appropriate or where we want to invest our capital. I mean, if you look at the three one-off acquisitions that we transacted on, close to 6% on an NOI yield basis for brand-new assets. So from an after-CapEx basis, it's pretty appealing, especially considered to where some of these portfolios are trading. And then if you take into account the age and after-CapEx nature of those, we just feel like what we've been able to do so far has been a very good strategy for us. Now if there's a portfolio out there that we think has some type of strategic nature to it, that makes us stronger in some way, we would absolutely take a look at that. And if it's accretive to earnings, we would be interested in looking at something like that.\nAdam Kramer : And then just as a quick follow-up here. Just remind us where kind of the pre-COVID bad debt level or rule of thumb is and then kind of where you are today relative to that. And your view as to kind of getting back to that pre-COVID number, is that something that can happen in 2025 or is that still multiple years away?\nTim Argo : I mean, we're -- honestly, we're just about there. I mean, I think pre-COVID, it was anywhere from 30 basis points to 40 basis points of net delinquency. Right now, we're at about 40 basis points. So there's -- at most, there's 5 basis points to 10 basis points of difference in terms of where we were pre-COVID. We didn't -- they certainly didn't deteriorate near as much as some other markets and we've just now gotten back to where we were pre-COVID.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from Truist Securities.\nMichael Lewis : So Eric, in the press release last night and in your remarks, you said we're confident we will enter a new multi-year cycle with demand outpacing supply. One of the points of pushback I sometimes get is with cost pressures easing, the short-term interest rates coming down and developers who have capital like you are already starting projects that maybe this cycle will be short, right? That maybe what ends up happening is your same-store growth in '25 is similar or a little bit better than '24 and maybe '26 is a good year. And then by the time you get to '27, you have -- your next wave of deliveries. So maybe there's historical precedent or kind of what do you think about the reason why Sunbelt supply won't just rise up to meet the demand kind of more quickly than in the past?\nEric Bolton : Well, I think to put it in context, what's important to recall or remember is that the deliveries this year, this is not a normal supply cycle. The deliveries this year is a 50-year high, a 50-year high. And so do I think that by '27, 2028, and '29, that we could see supply levels pick up from where they will likely be in '25 and '26? It is certainly possible. You have to start to think about financing costs and construction costs and when things pencil out by that point in a way that is super compelling for developers. But I think that the idea that we are going to any time in the next 10 years repeat this 50-year high cycle, I think, is not reasonable, in my opinion. So I think that -- and of course, we've long believed that ultimately, what really drives performance and ability to drive value for shareholder capital over a long period of time is really the demand side of the business. We go through these periodic cycles where supply picks up, but because of some of the things Brad mentioned in terms of how we've diversified across both mid-tier and large tier markets, we think we can weather these supply cycles okay. And if you had told me two years ago, three years ago we were headed to a 50-year high delivery of new supply and that our NOI was only going to go down by 1.3%, I'd take that all day long. That's -- if that's as bad as it gets in a 50-year period, that's okay. And next year will be better. '26 will be even better. I think '27 and '28 will be even better. Now is it possible that again, supply picks up in '28, '29? Probably so. But I don't see us going back to another 50-year high.\nBrad Hill: Yes, Michael, this is Brad. The only point I would add is if you look at the starts that occurred in first, second, third quarter of 2022, there's a very high correlation with that associated with where interest rates were, historic low interest rates. I think interest rates could come down a little bit from where they are today, but they certainly, we don't think, go back to that level that really spurred this kind of excessive 50-year high supply levels that Eric was talking about.\nMichael Lewis : And I'm going to structure my second question kind of the same way, right? I'm going to read a brief excerpt from Cushman & Wakefield's 3Q National Apartment Report and then ask you a question. So they said, demand for apartment units is booming again. Resurgent international migration trends in recent years alongside a stout labor market continue to power some of the best multifamily demand on record. So maybe this is opening a can of worms or maybe it's a better question after maybe for NAREIT when hopefully we know who the next President is going to be. But since they singled out migration, it's not a topic that I hear a lot about as a primary demand driver. Is it -- now that maybe we'll have mass deportations, I don't know. But to the extent the migration picture changes, is this a major key variable? Like in 2025, is this going to be a key demand variable potentially where me and the rest of the analysts on the call are writing research reports about this? Or do you think is that wildly overstating the importance of how that trends?\nEric Bolton : I think the influence immigration has on our property performance is a function of two things. It's a function of the markets, obviously. And I would argue that a number of the coastal gateway markets are going to be more influenced by immigration trends than a lot of our Sunbelt markets. Secondly, I would tell you that the price point of your product is going to also be impacted somewhat or is a variable that can be influenced by immigration trends. And we think that a lower price point portfolio is more likely than not to be more at risk from fluctuation with growing or declining levels of immigration. We think that we are not exposed in that way. Over 80% of our portfolio is single. Majority are female. We're serving a resident profile with average incomes of over $80,000, $85,000 a year. I mean, this is not a demographic that we're serving largely in our portfolio that's going to be influenced or impacted one way or the other by changing immigration trends.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kim from Zelman.\nAlex Kim : I wanted to ask about occupancy trends. Same-store occupancy rose 20 basis points sequentially this quarter and I know it stands at 95.4% in October. But can you talk through some of the drivers of the 3Q increase? And with blended rent growth inflecting negatively during the quarter, I mean, when does incremental occupancy become less valuable than rent growth to your revenue strategy?\nTim Argo : I mean, I think as far as the increase in occupancy from Q2 to Q3 is a function of the absorption we talked about and getting more units absorbed than were delivered. And we certainly saw that play out in our portfolio and the majority of our markets saw that sequential gain. We balance pricing and occupancy at a market, submarket property level. I think we're comfortable where we are right now with occupancy at 95.4% primarily because of what we see with exposure that we talked about. We're at a record low exposure, something we haven't seen ever at [ 6.3 ] which what that does is kind of stabilizes where we think occupancy will be over the next 60 days or so and allow this where we can to push on pricing. So exposure is what we look at a little more than occupancy. And it sits in that range. We're certainly comfortable in this 95.4%, 95.5% range and being able to push a little bit on pricing where we can.\nAlex Kim : And then just a quick follow-up here. This is now the second quarter [inaudible] that was already in lease-up. Can you talk through just kind of what you're seeing, what you like about that strategy? And it is something that you'll continue employing moving forward?\nBrad Hill: You kind of broke up on your question. Can you repeat that last question?\nAlex Kim : Yes, sorry. Just asking about your recent activity in buying properties and lease-up. Just curious about that strategy and if it's something you'll continue.\nBrad Hill: Yes, absolutely. Our acquisition strategy has been focused on brand new properties in their initial lease-up for the last few years. Again, we just think that there's an opportunity for us to execute in that area, given that it's harder to get to line up financing when a property is not stabilized and our ability to execute all cash is a benefit for us that we're able to really execute driving higher returns, higher NOI yields than what we could get on a fully marketed project that's stabilized. So yes, we'll continue to focus in that area.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Ann Chan from Green Street.\nAnn Chan : Just one question for me and keeping on the topic of demand earlier. Amongst your larger markets, particularly where supply continues to pressure pricing, which markets are you underwriting weaker or stronger job growth or in migration on a relative basis?\nTim Argo : Well, certainly, a market that we talked a lot about that on right now, Austin is one that as we think about longer term is one that we're really high on. I mean, we -- in terms of broader trends, we look at migration, we look at household formation. We look at population growth and obviously look at job growth, and Austin is near the top of the list in all of those. So that would be one. Raleigh is another one that we feel strong about. Orlando is one that has had some struggle with supply, but it's got some really strong demand metrics. So most of our footprint, we would be happy to continue to acquire in. But those are two, three markets that I would point out is having some really strong forward-looking demand trends.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton : Okay. No further comments from the company. I appreciate you joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you out at NAREIT.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Bolton",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Third quarter results for core FFO were ahead of our expectations as same-store NOI came in better than our forecast. Based on our analysis, we believe that peak deliveries of new supply that is impacting our sub-markets and properties occurred this past third quarter. Despite this record-high supply pressure in Q3, we were able to capture solid performance in occupancy, record low resident turnover, strong collections and better than expected performance with operating expenses, which all contributed to the third quarter NOI results. In addition, as Tim will detail in his comments, we are beginning to see early trends with new lease pricing that support our position that the worst of the pressures on pricing from new supply are likely behind us. As we have been discussing for the past year or so, we are now poised to see moderating trends in the amount of new supply deliveries that are impacting our portfolio as we head into 2025. We expect to see normal seasonal leasing patterns for the next couple of quarters and remain convinced that the spring leasing season will usher in the start of a recovery cycle with more favorable leasing conditions as demand and absorption trends across our markets remain strong and the volume of new supply deliveries steadily declines. With strengthening leasing conditions, significant redevelopment opportunity in our existing portfolio and meaningful efficiency gains from various new technology initiatives, we are excited about the upside outlook from our asset base. This momentum coupled with the significant expansion of our external growth pipeline from our in house new development projects, our prepurchase joint venture program and our recent new property acquisitions all combined for what we believe is a positive outlook for meaningful value growth. Before turning the call over to Brad, I'd like to send my appreciation out to our MAA associates for their tremendous work and great results over this very busy third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Brad. I think it's -- Alex, this is Eric. I think it's important to just recap what Tim said earlier is that of our 15 largest markets, 10 of those actually saw new lease-over-lease pricing improve in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. And if you take just Austin out of the mix and just exclude Austin from our Q2 and Q3 performance trends on new lease pricing, our new lease pricing in Q3 would have been up 10 basis points from where it was in Q2. So Austin clearly is having an outsized impact on the portfolio right now. We feel great about that market long-term. But certainly in 2024, it's weighing on the performance of the portfolio as a whole, given just the absolute level of supply that came into that one market. Yes, the other thing that I'll add to that quickly on top of Tim's comment is that don't forget what Tim mentioned in that we intentionally only have about 16% of our leases expiring in the fourth quarter. And then you consider that roughly a good percentage of those are going to renew as a renewal transaction versus a new lease transaction. So the overall impact on earn-in from new lease performance between now and the end of the year is not as significant as you might think it is, given the low percentage of leases set to expire and the split between renewal and new lease pricing that will take place. Well, I think to put it in context, what's important to recall or remember is that the deliveries this year, this is not a normal supply cycle. The deliveries this year is a 50-year high, a 50-year high. And so do I think that by '27, 2028, and '29, that we could see supply levels pick up from where they will likely be in '25 and '26? It is certainly possible. You have to start to think about financing costs and construction costs and when things pencil out by that point in a way that is super compelling for developers. But I think that the idea that we are going to any time in the next 10 years repeat this 50-year high cycle, I think, is not reasonable, in my opinion. So I think that -- and of course, we've long believed that ultimately, what really drives performance and ability to drive value for shareholder capital over a long period of time is really the demand side of the business. We go through these periodic cycles where supply picks up, but because of some of the things Brad mentioned in terms of how we've diversified across both mid-tier and large tier markets, we think we can weather these supply cycles okay. And if you had told me two years ago, three years ago we were headed to a 50-year high delivery of new supply and that our NOI was only going to go down by 1.3%, I'd take that all day long. That's -- if that's as bad as it gets in a 50-year period, that's okay. And next year will be better. '26 will be even better. I think '27 and '28 will be even better. Now is it possible that again, supply picks up in '28, '29? Probably so. But I don't see us going back to another 50-year high. I think the influence immigration has on our property performance is a function of two things. It's a function of the markets, obviously. And I would argue that a number of the coastal gateway markets are going to be more influenced by immigration trends than a lot of our Sunbelt markets. Secondly, I would tell you that the price point of your product is going to also be impacted somewhat or is a variable that can be influenced by immigration trends. And we think that a lower price point portfolio is more likely than not to be more at risk from fluctuation with growing or declining levels of immigration. We think that we are not exposed in that way. Over 80% of our portfolio is single. Majority are female. We're serving a resident profile with average incomes of over $80,000, $85,000 a year. I mean, this is not a demographic that we're serving largely in our portfolio that's going to be influenced or impacted one way or the other by changing immigration trends. Okay. No further comments from the company. I appreciate you joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you out at NAREIT."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. MAA's long-term strategy of focusing on high-growth markets and diversifying within those markets uniquely positions our portfolio to benefit from the continued strong demand in our footprint. As an attractive, more-affordable alternative to much of the higher priced new multifamily supply being delivered as well as the available single-family housing options, our residents are choosing to stay with us longer, with only 11.5% of our move-outs occurring due to residents buying a home. Our customer service is reflected in our Google Scores, which continues to lead the sector, supports our strong renewals and record low turnover rate. With our 60 day exposure, which represents all current vacancies and notices over the next 60 days, 30 basis points better than last year and new deliveries poised to decline, our communities are well positioned for the seasonally slower months and for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in the spring summer of 2025. Throughout this year, we've continued to make progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In the third quarter, we added two new projects to our under construction development pipeline, bringing our total under construction developments to eight projects, representing 2,762 units at a cost of approximately $978 million a record level of development for MAA. In addition to the previously disclosed 239 unit Charlotte project, where we provided financing to take out the equity partner on an under construction community, we also closed and started construction on a 360, excuse me, 306 unit community in Richmond and Virginia in the third quarter. The Richmond project was a fully entitled, shovel ready development that we took over from a developer who was unable to obtain financing. The Charlotte project should deliver first units in the third quarter of 2025 and we expect the Richmond project to deliver first units in first quarter of 2027. We expect to start construction on one more project during the fourth quarter, bringing our total development starts for the year to five at a cost of $508 million, exceeding our original guidance for the year. We expect these projects to deliver an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 6.3%. With our development pipeline approaching $1 billion, our focus turns to maintaining our pipeline at this level going forward. Pre-development work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which now includes 10 projects, representing future growth of over 2,800 units at an expected cost of $1.1 billion. We have seen some construction cost declines in a few markets and remain hopeful that as the total under construction pipeline in our markets continues its steep decline, we could see further improvement in construction cost and schedules as well as we get into 2025, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields. In the transaction market, volume remains relatively low with cap rates trending down into the high 4% range. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities at pricing the market cap rates, generally in lease up and often on an off market basis. In the third quarter, we closed on a 310 unit suburban property in Orlando for approximately $84 million approximately 10% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is nearly stabilized at just under 90% occupancy. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a closed on a 386 unit mid-rise property in the Knox Henderson area of Dallas at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. This property just wrapped up construction and is in its initial lease up. This brings our total acquisition volume for the year to just over $270 million at an average stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%. Our team is actively evaluating other acquisition opportunities and we are hopeful, we'll close another compelling acquisition before year end. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold a 216 unit property in Charlotte, North Carolina for $39 million and we have an additional property in Richmond, Virginia under contract to sell with an expected closing during the fourth quarter. We have two more properties in Columbia, South Carolina on the market with a likely closing in early 2025. Before I turn the call over to Tim, I want to echo Eric's comments to our associates. Thank you for your hard work and dedication during this busy third quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim. Haendel, this is Brad. I mean, generally, relative to the compelling comment that really is similar to what we're investing in today. And if you look at the stabilized NOI yields of the three acquisitions we've had this year at 5.9% relative to where current market cap rates are, those are pretty compelling returns, I would say. Really, what we're focused on and where we're finding our opportunities are on properties that are generally brand new. Most times they are just finishing up their initial lease-up -- or excuse me, just finishing up construction and just entering in their initial lease-up. It's assets that are tougher for other folks to get financed. But given our ability to close all cash, we have some competitive advantage versus others in the market. There's also opportunities for us to put our operating platform on these assets to drive additional returns that many other folks can't do. Oftentimes, we're looking for properties that are in proximity to current assets that we have, where we're able to plot those properties and really generate additional returns. So those are kind of the competitive angles that we're looking for where we're able to generate additional returns. And then the last point I would just make is generally, a lot of what we're doing is off-market. We have extensive relationships in this region of the country exclusively operating for 30 years. About 80% of the $2 billion that we purchased over the last 10 years have been with merchant developers. So we have extensive relationships that we're able to lean on that allow us to -- the opportunity to execute at returns that often exceed what the market rates are. Yes. If I forget something in that question, please let me know. But yes, I mean, in terms of the size of the development pipeline, we've commented for a couple of years now really a desire to build that pipeline to $1 billion, $1.2 billion total size. Today, we're just under $1 billion so we've got a little bit of room to grow that a little bit. That would equate to about three to four starts a year in over a three year period, which is really the time line it takes for most of these projects that gets us to our $1 billion, $1.2 billion. So that's really -- we're very comfortable, given the size of our balance sheet of really maintaining our pipeline at that level. And clearly, given what we think are going to be strong operating fundamentals in '26, '27, this is a great time for us to be ramping up that development pipeline to that $1 billion, $1.2 billion level. In terms of how we're underwriting these projects very conservatively, the developments that we have delivering today on average, even in this high supply environment, we're exceeding our underwriting on average by about 50 basis points. So we underwrite very conservatively. Very little trending in rents for the first few years. And typically, you get to year three, year four, you start trending a little bit more. We're trending our expenses the entire hold period. So that's generally how we underwrite our deals but on a very conservative basis. Buck, this is Brad. Yes, I mean, we definitely believe in our strategy of allocating capital between both large markets and these mid-tier markets. So we are very much committed to continuing to growing our presence and allocating capital both through acquisitions and development in some of these mid-tier markets. And really, it's been a function of just where the opportunities have come. So we haven't seen as many opportunities, given the lower level of supply in some of these mid-tier markets but we are seeing some of those opportunities. Now, we acquired the Raleigh project earlier this year, the development here in Richmond. So you'll see us continue to have a focus in those mid-tier markets. I would say from a stabilized yield perspective, there's maybe 10 basis points, 20 basis points difference in today's rate. So Richmond's close to 6.5% and some of the other projects are maybe 6.25%, 6.3%. So there's not a big swing in terms of some of the yields for these projects. But really, that is going to manifest itself maybe a little bit on IRRs where we're getting higher IRRs on the projects in the secondary markets as the exit cap rates may be a little bit different. But that's really the only difference in terms of the underwriting projects. Adam, this is Brad. I mean, generally, what we see on portfolios is a lot of times, the quality of the assets are not what we're looking for. There's some type of bad with the good, so to speak. In some of the portfolios that we've seen recently, I mean, frankly, part of that has been pricing. Some of the pricing on those assets were more aggressive than what we believed was appropriate or where we want to invest our capital. I mean, if you look at the three one-off acquisitions that we transacted on, close to 6% on an NOI yield basis for brand-new assets. So from an after-CapEx basis, it's pretty appealing, especially considered to where some of these portfolios are trading. And then if you take into account the age and after-CapEx nature of those, we just feel like what we've been able to do so far has been a very good strategy for us. Now if there's a portfolio out there that we think has some type of strategic nature to it, that makes us stronger in some way, we would absolutely take a look at that. And if it's accretive to earnings, we would be interested in looking at something like that. Yes, Michael, this is Brad. The only point I would add is if you look at the starts that occurred in first, second, third quarter of 2022, there's a very high correlation with that associated with where interest rates were, historic low interest rates. I think interest rates could come down a little bit from where they are today, but they certainly, we don't think, go back to that level that really spurred this kind of excessive 50-year high supply levels that Eric was talking about. You kind of broke up on your question. Can you repeat that last question? Yes, absolutely. Our acquisition strategy has been focused on brand new properties in their initial lease-up for the last few years. Again, we just think that there's an opportunity for us to execute in that area, given that it's harder to get to line up financing when a property is not stabilized and our ability to execute all cash is a benefit for us that we're able to really execute driving higher returns, higher NOI yields than what we could get on a fully marketed project that's stabilized. So yes, we'll continue to focus in that area."

            "content": "It's Rob. I think it's really a combination of factors. I think part of it is the selection of the sites and what we're building. But ultimately, it's the ongoing repair and maintenance that we're spending on the properties, making sure that the roofs are relatively new, they're intact and the preparation we do before the storms come in really assist with minimizing our damage. So it really is only cleanup that we're stuck with and kind of some landscaping and other smaller things. And of course, the prior year comparisons factor into this as well."

            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As noted by both Eric and Brad, various demand metrics we track remain strong, partially mitigating the impact of new supply deliveries that we believe peaked in the third quarter. 60 day exposure is better than at any point over the last five years. The seasonal deceleration of Middle East pricing is less than the prior year and pre-COVID periods and absorption remains strong. However, pricing growth particularly on new leases continues to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but as noted showed less seasonal deceleration than we typically see this time of the year. For the third quarter, new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis was minus 5.4%, just a 30 basis point decline from the second quarter compared to a 270 basis point decline over the same period last year. In fact, 10 of our top 15 highest concentration markets showed new lease-over-lease growth acceleration from the second to third quarter. Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong growing [Technical Difficulty] lease-over-lease basis. These two components resulted in lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis of minus 0.2%, also a 30 basis point decline from the second quarter and compared to a 220 basis point decline over the same period last year. Average physical occupancy was 95.7%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter, demonstrating the strong absorption in our markets. Collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.4% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same store revenue that was in line with the third quarter of 2023. Along with the demand metrics noted, our unique market diversification strategy that Brad mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. As we have mentioned previously, several of our mid-tier markets are holding up better in this higher supply environment. Savannah, Richmond, Charleston, Greenville and our Fredericksburg and our other Northern Virginia properties are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Particularly in a down cycle, our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets helped strengthen overall portfolio performance. Also as has been the case all year, Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets with Austin being the toughest challenge of all the markets. We continue to execute on our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives, where it makes sense in this elevated supply environment with the expectation of starting to reaccelerate next year. For the third quarter of 2024, we completed over 1,700 interior unit upgrades, achieving rate increases of $108 above non-upgraded units. We are encouraged by the strength of this program in this competitive environment demonstrated by the fact that these units lease quicker on average than a non-renovated unit when adjusted for the additional turn time. For our repositioning program, we have two active projects that are in the repricing phase with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional six projects underway with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in the spring of 2025, in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment. As we wrap up, October, we are seeing normal seasonal moderation but are encouraged by demand that should continue to keep the sequential seasonal pricing deceleration better than historical trends. Our 60 day exposure of 6.3% should serve to keep occupancy stable and allow for more pricing power than last year, as we also start to lap new lease pricing that weakened significantly during the fourth quarter of last year. Absorption remains strong in our markets with the third quarter representing the first time since the first quarter of 2022 that units absorbed exceeded units delivered. Therefore, there is not a significant backlog of inventory needing to be absorbed. Accordingly, October new lease pricing is within 10 basis points of September new lease pricing, demonstrating this demand and our expectation of less seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter than we normally experience. Furthermore, lease-over-lease rates on accepted renewals for November and December in the 4.25 range. We will only reprice approximately 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter, which minimizes the impact of this moderation on the portfolio. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply deliveries continue to be a headwind in many of our markets. However, we still believe the near-term outlook is in line with what we have discussed last few quarters. That is we expect this new supply will begin to moderate and that we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease-over-lease pricing growth and that the supply-demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. At a portfolio level, construction starts in our footprint peaked in mid-2022 and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction start. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay. Jamie, this is Tim. Yes, I think, in terms of occupancy pretty consistent with where we are right now. We're at 95.4% currently. I think 95.4% to 95.5% for Q4 is a range we're comfortable with, particularly with where we see exposure right now. As I mentioned in my comments, the renewal rates that we're getting for November and December in the 4.25% range, so call it 4% to 4.5% for the fourth quarter in terms of renewals. And then, on new lease pricing, we mentioned the new lease pricing for October moderated only about 10 basis points from September. It was 6.9% in September, 7% in October. I think you see a little bit of moderation from here but not much and see less deceleration than we typically do as we commented in the call. Yes. I think just kind of thinking through the expense structure, I mean, starting with real estate tax expenses and insurance. The growth that we've seen in real estate tax expenses of about 2%. Yes, I believe that will be a little tough to repeat that level at next year. I would think that, that would get some more of a normalized growth rate, call it, somewhere between 3% and 4%. But I believe that, that would be appropriate for real estate taxes insurance. We had the slight decrease in our premium renewal this past July. And so, we'll get that for the first half of next year and then we'll have to reprice in July of next year. It's hard to say at this point where that's going to ultimately end up. I don't think it gets back to the levels of increases that we saw over the past couple of years, but also don't think it's going to be flat either. So somewhere in the 5% to 10% range, keeping in mind that insurance is just a small piece of our overall expense debt. And then, regards to personnel costs, I think that continues to moderate a little bit. And as we get some of these inflationary impacts behind us, some more things for repair and maintenance. We've talked about some of the moderation we've seen this past year in repair and maintenance. I don't know that we'll be back at that level, in 2025, but I think it will also be more of a reasonable growth rate, something around 3% to 3.5%. Marketing expenses, I think would be the other one to call out that continue may run a little high at the first half of the year, but I would expect that to come back down, as we comp some of these increases that we've seen this past year. Yes. I mean, as we've talked about supply definitely peaked sort of the mid to second, third quarter of 2022 and that's pretty consistent across all our markets. Some of them lagged or were ahead of that maybe a quarter or so, but pretty consistent. And as we talked about we think about two years from start is when we see the maximum amount of pressure, which is kind of about right now and what we saw in Q3. I think we'll see a little bit of moderating pressure in Q4 won't necessarily show up with seasonal moderation and just less traffic, less leases expiring. So I think as we get into the spring and summer, I would expect, we'll see normal seasonality just like we would any other period, but start to see some strength particularly on the new lease side, as demand picks up seasonally and as the impact of the moderating supply, which we think in general supply is probably down 20% or so in 2025 as compared to 2024. So should start to see that strength, as we get into the spring. Yes. I think in terms of earn-in, if you think about our blended lease-over-lease expectations for full year of 2024, it's somewhere in that negative 3% range and half of that if not a little more carries over into 2025 which kind of drives the earn-in. So, slightly negative call it 20 basis points, 30 basis points somewhere in that range where we sit right now in terms of earn-in. I'm not sure I caught all of that but I know you were asking about absorption initially. I mean, yes, we don't see any reason for absorption to go backwards. I mean, if you look at absorption so far this year, Q1 was a record high for any first quarter since we've been tracking it. Q2 was the highest absorption since early 2021. And Q3 as I mentioned saw us actually absorb more units than we delivered for the first time since Q1 in 2022. We don't see anything on the demand side that's moderating. I mean, you think about job growth, household formation, population growth, move-outs to buy a home, we expect turnover to continue to stay low. So I think demand will hold up strong and as supply starts to moderate, which we think it will, I would expect absorption to be as good if not better as we look into 2025. Yes. I mean, broadly concessions in Q3 were pretty consistent with Q2. I mean, it's pretty standard in a lot of markets that you're seeing on in a stabilized submarket half a month to a month, something like that. Now we are seeing in lease-up areas a little more than that, and it's the markets I mentioned, particularly Austin and Atlanta. In Austin, you're seeing up to three months when you think about Central Austin and Georgetown area and then particularly in Midtown Atlanta seeing up to three months. So I'll call out those two kind of submarket markets as the highest concessionary environment but pretty consistent with what it's been in most of our other markets. But we are still seeing, if we look at the new supply being delivered on aggregate, it's about anywhere from $250 to $300 higher price point than our average portfolio. We didn't say 3%. I think our gain to lease right now, looking at -- if you look at where October rents or October leases compared to in-place rents, it's about 0.7% gain to lease, which is not too unusual this time of year with seasonal pricing starts to decelerate some seasonally, so it's not a big number for us right now. I think what we did talk about was just kind of the earn-in being slightly negative headed into 2025. And then I would expect we see better new lease pricing in 2025 as compared to what we saw in 2024. Yes. I would say your second point is right. I mean, we're -- we would expect to see consistent demand, certainly consistent, if not a little bit better absorption but where we think and we'd like to see that play out is more on rates and more new lease rates as opposed to trying to get occupancy to 96% or 96.5%, something like that we would prefer to focus on rates. To your first point, I mean, I wouldn't say that we're the only ones feeling supply pressure. Those are certainly feeling more supply pressure. I mean, most of our markets are getting more supply than what we would call a typical market but holding up a little better, given where the supply is occurring relative to our markets and demand and all that. So we're certainly in a more elevated supply picture, but also in Atlanta are ones that stand out a little bit. But I think those start to get better next year as do most of our other markets. Mike, this is Tim. Nothing that we've seen at a material level. I mean, we did see -- we talked about performance between A and B assets in urban, suburban. We did see that narrow a little bit with our urban properties performing a little bit better. I'm not sure that's necessarily related to anything return to office but we did see a little bit of performance there. But broadly speaking, not seeing a lot of shift in any of the metrics that we track. Yes, this is Tim. I mean, I think new lease pricing is the key metric that we're looking at in terms of -- it's not going to -- what happens in the rest of this quarter is not going to be impactful necessarily to 2024, but it does have some impact to some extent on earn-in and where we start the year. Occupancy, we think will be relatively stable and so it's going to [inaudible] and we think renewals will continue to be stable. They've been in that 4% to 5% range all throughout this year so we don't expect to see that change necessarily. So it will come down to the new lease rates and sort of where those -- how those play out and then we'll have more to say as we get into Q4 earnings release. But certainly, sitting here today compared to where we were 12 months ago, I feel a lot better both in just macroeconomic variables. Recession risk is down. There's a little more certainty there. We know supply is starting to moderate and so feel pretty good that sets up for a little bit better year. I mean, it's still going to be elevated supply. And even in a normal environment, new lease rates in Q1 and Q4 are typically negative so we don't expect that necessarily to change. But we do expect to see a little more positive momentum in terms of new lease pricing when we get into Q2 and Q3. Yes. I mean, you called out one that can start to have an impact. I mean, we're testing or retrofitting four properties this year that are just now starting to go live that have that property-wide ubiquitous Wi-Fi, if you will. And so if you think about those four properties by themselves is once it's fully rolled out and kind of flows through the portfolio is close to $1 million. So you can start to extrapolate the opportunities that we have there. We expect to expand that pretty significantly next year, initially looking at maybe 20 to 25 properties that we do in 2025. So on the revenue side that would be one that I'd call out. We're wrapping up the smart installations at the last few properties now. There'll be a little bit of tailwind from that in 2025, but other than rent growth and stable occupancy, I think the Wi-Fi starts to slowly have a bit of an impact. Yes. To answer your first question, you have those numbers correct. That is what we stated. As far as new lease rates, we'll talk more about this, obviously, in our next quarter earnings. Difficult to say right now exactly where it will get to. We're kind of going through our budgeting planning process now. I think one point to make is through this year, our best new lease pricing was about negative 4%, negative 4.2%, something like that in July. We certainly expect to exceed that. And to reiterate a point I made earlier, in normal supply demand environments, Q1, Q4, typically negative new lease pricing anyway. So it's really Q2 and Q3 where you start to see it go positive. So more to come on that but we certainly believe all of the factors, supply and demand point to much better new lease performance in '25 than '24. That's right. Well, we'll see and it might. We certainly don't expect it to get much worse for all the reasons we've laid out, including those easier comps. It's always new lease is certainly the tip of the spear and can change on a dime. But we feel comfortable it's going to stay in this range, if not start to improve a little bit. But the other point is just there's not much leases as we mentioned, 16% and frankly not a lot of traffic, particularly when you get into mid-November on through December just with holidays, just not a lot of people searching. So it's not going to have a material impact one way or the other but it could -- we could see us sort of hanging in where it is right now. I mean, we're -- honestly, we're just about there. I mean, I think pre-COVID, it was anywhere from 30 basis points to 40 basis points of net delinquency. Right now, we're at about 40 basis points. So there's -- at most, there's 5 basis points to 10 basis points of difference in terms of where we were pre-COVID. We didn't -- they certainly didn't deteriorate near as much as some other markets and we've just now gotten back to where we were pre-COVID. I mean, I think as far as the increase in occupancy from Q2 to Q3 is a function of the absorption we talked about and getting more units absorbed than were delivered. And we certainly saw that play out in our portfolio and the majority of our markets saw that sequential gain. We balance pricing and occupancy at a market, submarket property level. I think we're comfortable where we are right now with occupancy at 95.4% primarily because of what we see with exposure that we talked about. We're at a record low exposure, something we haven't seen ever at [ 6.3 ] which what that does is kind of stabilizes where we think occupancy will be over the next 60 days or so and allow this where we can to push on pricing. So exposure is what we look at a little more than occupancy. And it sits in that range. We're certainly comfortable in this 95.4%, 95.5% range and being able to push a little bit on pricing where we can. Well, certainly, a market that we talked a lot about that on right now, Austin is one that as we think about longer term is one that we're really high on. I mean, we -- in terms of broader trends, we look at migration, we look at household formation. We look at population growth and obviously look at job growth, and Austin is near the top of the list in all of those. So that would be one. Raleigh is another one that we feel strong about. Orlando is one that has had some struggle with supply, but it's got some really strong demand metrics. So most of our footprint, we would be happy to continue to acquire in. But those are two, three markets that I would point out is having some really strong forward-looking demand trends."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.21 per share, which was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Just under $0.03 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses, with an additional $0.02 driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense and non-operating income. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were relatively in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, same-store revenues benefited from strong occupancy during the quarter. Our same-store expense performance, particularly real estate taxes was favorable compared to our guidance for the quarter. We've received property valuations for our Florida portfolio, which were lower than our expectations. Repairs and maintenance costs continue to show moderation, growing at 2% compared to third quarter last year. During the quarter, we funded nearly $167 million of development cost of the current $978 million pipeline, leaving an expected $368 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two to three years. We also invested approximately $13 million of capital through our redevelopment and repositioning programs during the quarter, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains solid. We ended the quarter with just over $800 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.9x. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average maturity of seven years at an effective rate of 3.8%. Finally, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year, while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the third quarter, we are slightly adjusting the midpoint of effective rent growth guidance by 15 basis points to 0.35% and revising total same-store revenue guidance for the year to 0.5% at the midpoint. With property valuations for our Florida portfolio now known, we have more insight into our overall real estate tax expense for 2024, and are lowering the midpoint of our guidance to 2%. This results in the lowering of our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 3.75% at the midpoint. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results in reaffirming our original midpoint expectation for same-store NOI at minus 1.3%. In addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we are revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. These adjustments combined with the $0.02 to $0.03 of estimated impact of clean-up cost related to storms in the fourth quarter resulted in us to maintain the midpoint of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share, while narrowing the range to $8.80 to $8.96 per share. Including the fourth quarter, we estimate our 2024 results will include approximately $0.08 to $0.09 of total storm clean-up costs compared to $0.01 of cost included in our initial 2024 guidance. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Julianne, we will now turn the call back to you for questions. Yes. There are a couple of markets. Austin, as we've talked about all year, continues to be our most-challenging market and we saw new lease rates in Austin pick up in a negative way quite a bit from Q2 to Q3. We saw a little bit in Raleigh. But I think the point as far as Q3 is concerned, it was pretty targeted to a couple of markets. I made a comment in the prepared comments that out of our 15 highest concentration markets, we actually saw 10 of those 15 new lease rates accelerate. And so, actually if you pull out -- if you focus on just Austin and pull that -- pull the new lease rates in Austin out of both the Q2 and Q3 numbers, we actually would have seen new lease rate from Q2 to Q3 accelerate about 10 basis points, as opposed to a 30 basis point decline. Certainly, Austin was a big driver. Atlanta continues to be a struggle, but obviously, we feel really good about Austin long-term and it's just working through a lot of supply but it did have an outsized impact on what we saw with new lease rates. Yes. I mean, it impacts renewals to some extent. If you think about for the third quarter, renewals were what somewhere in the 4% range, 4.1%. Austin was 1.5% to give you some perspective on that. It does tend to impact renewal rates a little bit but we certainly see much stronger renewal spreads than we do even for some of those more challenging markets. Yes. Right now, that's kind of where we're leaning into. I mean, when we look at our cost of equity versus our cost of debt, right now, we're actually trading at probably a slight discount. So we're going to probably lean more into the debt side versus the equity for the time being. But as things begin to change and we expect to get a little bit more benefit there on the equity side at some point, and we'd probably lean a little bit more in that direction when the time is right. Yes, John, this is Clay. So I think whenever you kind of look at what the cost that we had -- that we were projecting for the full year this year, it's going to be somewhere around $10 million, $9 million, $10 million call it. When you look back at over the, call it, past seven years, six, seven years, we haven't had anything of this magnitude that we've had to deal with. And it's been spread across each quarter this year. It hasn't been just one quarter or one storm. It's been multiple storms impacting us throughout the year. So I think as we look towards next year, that's not something we've traditionally done in the past as far as including some storm cost in our guidance, but we did include $0.01 in our guidance this past year [inaudible] earnings back in February and then released our 2024 guidance in February. So we reflected that but that's the only cost that we reflected in our guidance. But as we look forward to next year, I think that you expect to see something in there. It will not be at the levels that we experienced this year just because history has shown that that's the norm. But I would expect it will include something in our guidance to account for that. Well the one that's -- the insurance cost in Florida gets a lot of publicity. Of course, one thing you have to consider is just our overall portfolio and that we're able to defer a little bit of that risk across all of our markets, not just in the Florida market. So we're still committed to Florida. Yes, there's some higher costs related to insurance there but just given our size and portfolio of our platform that we have across the portfolio, we can still take advantage of some opportunities there. Yes. We -- you got to think over these -- the damage that we've seen has been extremely moderate, so damage is probably a strong word. It's more of a cleanup that we see whenever we -- these properties are typically impacted. If you do have a property that was significantly damaged, lost a number of units that had to -- that would not be able to be occupied, we would probably remove that property from same-store while it was being repaired and put back into service. So we'll treat that particular property as appropriate based on our general policy of how we include stores and same-store versus non-same store. But to your point, these cleanup costs, we've reflected those as non-same store costs in our earnings calls, we don't want it to impact the comparability of the same-store portfolio."

Core FFO results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as the strong demand for apartment housing across our markets is steadily absorbing the new supply being delivered. This strong demand continues to support steady occupancy performance from our portfolio as well as blended lease-over-lease pricing that has consistently increased since Q4 of last year. These positive trends are continuing into July. MAA's strategy has long focused on positioning our portfolio to capture higher full cycle demand to drive superior long-term value growth. To best mitigate the occasional periods of supply pressure, we have a unique portfolio diversification strategy involving both large and mid-tier markets. Further by appealing to a broad segment of the rental market with a more affordable price point, as evidenced by our strong rent income ratios and sector leading low delinquency performance, we believe, we are able to drive higher demand and absorption across our portfolio. We continue to believe that new supply deliveries across our markets are currently peaking and we expect to see the volume of new deliveries decline over the back half of this year with 2025 ushering in a multi-year period where the growing demand for apartment housing will exceed the level of new competing supply. As detailed in yesterday's earnings release, we continue to find compelling opportunities to deploy capital in new acquisitions and development that will, we believe, deliver meaningful earnings accretion over the next few years. Our balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to deliver on this future value pipeline that we are building. We believe that with the combination of the evolving market conditions poised to decline with the level of new supply delivering across our markets, the redevelopment and repositioning opportunities available to harvest within our existing portfolio, and the new growth pipeline that we're building through in-house development, our pre-purchase program with third-party developers, and the acquisition of newly constructed properties, MAA is positioned for meaningful growth and value over the next few years. Before turning the call over to Brad, Tim, and Clay for more details, I'd like to send my thanks and appreciation to our MAA associates for their dedication and tremendous service to our residents. MAA is capturing record levels of resident retention, high resident satisfaction ratings, and strong lease renewal performance, thanks in large part to your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see solid demand in our markets supported by strong household formation and positive wage and job growth, leading to continued blended pricing momentum in July with stable occupancy. MAA's long-term strategy positions our portfolio as an attractive lower cost alternative to the higher priced new multi-family supply being delivered, as well as the available single-family housing options within our markets. Our renewal accept rates are at a record high and our Google scores continue to lead the sector, evidence of the value our residents find in living with MAA. With the backdoor controlled, we're very focused on the front door and encouraged by the improving traffic trends. Our property tours are higher than this time last year and our conversion of leads into leases is also up. With increased traffic, strong conversion, stable occupancy and lower exposure, our properties are well-positioned as we enter the back half of the year. As indicated in our release, we have made progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In addition to the two second quarter construction starts that bring our under construction pipeline at the end of the second quarter to 2,617 units at a cost of $866 million. In July, we provided financing to take out the equity partner on a 239 unit under construction development in the SouthPark area of Charlotte. The project suffered an early delay that put the project's investment horizon outside of the equities fund horizon. Our previous relationship with the developer and the equity partner provided us the unique opportunity to invest in an under construction project with no entitlement risk and a materially shortened construction schedule with first units scheduled to deliver in second quarter of 2025. The second quarter development starts -- the two second quarter development starts were expected to deliver first units in mid-2026 and all three projects are expected to deliver average initial stabilized NOI yields around 6.4%, similar to what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing. While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment, rents achieved at our developments are well above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOIs that should deliver stabilized NOI yields that exceed our original expectations by approximately 70 basis points. Pre-development work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which has increased to 11 projects, representing additional growth of over 3,100 units. We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, but we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year, bringing our development starts for the year to four to five at or slightly above our original guidance for the year and leading to a slight increase in our development spend for the year at $350 million. Construction costs have yet to decline broadly. But we are hopeful that as the current under construction pipeline winds down, we could see more improvement in construction costs and schedules as we progress through the year, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields. In the transaction market, volume remains low with cap rates generally in the low 5% range, with a number of transactions occurring well below 5%. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities generally in lease-up and on an aftermarket base -- on an off-market basis. In the second quarter, we closed on a 306 unit suburban property in Raleigh for approximately $81 million, which is 15% to 20% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease-up and finished the quarter at 62% occupied. We have two additional acquisition opportunities in due diligence and upon successfully concluding our inspections we expect the closings to occur over the next few months. The three acquisitions are expected to deliver stabilized NOI yields on average just under 6%. Based on the activity our team is seeing in the market, we believe, our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. We have two dispositions in the market, one in Charlotte and one in Richmond that we hope to execute on by the end of the year, but we are early in the process. Before I turn the call over to Tim, to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices, I want to say thank you for your hard work and dedication that you show on a daily basis to our prospects, residents, and fellow associates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.\nTim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As previously referenced, demand in our markets continue to be strong as evidenced by steadily improving lease-over-lease rates on new move-in residents and stable lease-over-lease rates on renewal residents. Pricing growth does continue to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but showed improvement over the first quarter as traffic patterns increased. These factors contributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of minus 5.1%, with renewal rates for the quarter staying strong, growing 4.6% on a lease-over-lease basis. These two components resulted in lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis that was an improvement of 70 basis points from the first quarter. Average physical occupancy was 95.5%, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same-store revenue growth of 0.7%. Our unique market diversification strategy that Eric mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. While some of our larger markets are being more heavily impacted by new supply deliveries, many of our mid-tier metros remain steady. Similar to last quarter, Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets and diversification of submarkets within the market help strengthen performance through the cycle. Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets. While we have slowed some of our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives, in this elevated supply environment, we do continue to execute where it makes sense with the expectation of reaccelerating next year. For the second quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,700 interior unit upgrades; achieving rent increases more than 8% above non-upgraded units. For our repositioning program, we have three active projects that are in the repricing phase. We will begin construction on an additional six projects in the third quarter with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025 in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment. With July now wrapped up, we're encouraged by the early third quarter trends. Average physical occupancy for the month of July of 95.5% is in line with second quarter and current occupancy is 95.8%. This stability in occupancy combined with the lower 60-day exposure that Brad noted sets us up for more pricing power for the remainder of the summer as we also start to lap weaker new lease pricing that became evident beginning in August of last year. Accordingly, July, blended pricing of positive 0.3% is up from the first and second quarters and the month of June. And new lease pricing has improved each month since March. Furthermore, the year-over-year change in asking rents for August is expected to be positive for the first time since February of 2023, 18 months ago. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, and it is resulting in prospects shopping longer and being more selective. However, we still believe the long-term outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter. That is, we expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, but we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease-over-lease pricing growth and that the supply/demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in mid-2022 and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction start. While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the second quarter in our markets was the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Wage growth remained strong with our rent to income ratio in the second quarter dropping a bit to 21%, the lowest level in three years. Additionally, we saw resident turnover continued to decline in the second quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. The 12.4% of move-outs in the second quarter that were due to resident buying a home was the lowest ever for MAA, slightly lower than what we saw in the first quarter. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.\nClay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.03 per share above the mid-point of our second quarter guidance. Just under $0.02 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses and $0.015 was driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense, and non-operating income partially offset by about $0.01 in storm cost. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, we saw sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in both blended pricing and occupancy while same-store revenues again benefited from strong rent collections. Our same-store expense performance, particularly in repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and personnel costs was favorable compared to our expectations for the quarter. Repair and maintenance costs continue to show moderation growing at 1.8% compared to second quarter last year. At this point in the year, we have better visibility into our real estate tax expense for 2024, which we will discuss more with our revised guidance in a moment. During the quarter, we funded nearly $80 million of development cost of the current expected $866 million pipeline, leaving an expected $328 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. Considering the Charlotte opportunity and the additional development starts that Brad mentioned and adjusting for those properties we will complete over the remainder of 2024, we expect our development pipeline to grow to just under $1 billion, which our balance sheet is well-positioned to support. During the quarter, we invested approximately $12 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning, and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.7x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 93% fixed with an average maturity of 7.4 years at an effective rate of 3.8%. During May, we issued $400 million of seven-year public bonds at an effective rate just below 5.4%, using the proceeds to effectively pay off a $400 million bond maturity in June that had an effective rate of 4%. While our next scheduled bond maturity isn't until the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect to be in the market prior to that date to support ongoing investment opportunities. Finally, we are reaffirming the mid-point of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the second quarter, we are making slight adjustments to our guidance associated with rent growth and occupancy. We are lowering the mid-point of effective rent growth guidance by 35 basis points to 0.5% and average physical occupancy guidance by 20 basis points to 95.5% for the year. Total same-store revenue guidance for the year was revised to 0.65%, which also reflects stronger expected rent collection performance over the back half of the year. We are lowering our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 4.25% at the mid-point. As previously mentioned we have better insight into our real estate tax expense for 2024 and have lowered the mid-point of our guidance to 4%. The lower guidance is primarily due to favorable Texas property valuations as compared to our original expectations. Also, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program on July 1 and have achieved a combined premium decrease of around 1%. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results and reaffirming our original expectation for same-store NOI at negative 1.3%. In addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we were revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. As Brad previously mentioned, we also increased the mid-point of our development spend to $350 million. The impact of these adjustments, combined with the $0.03 of expected storm costs associated with Hurricane Beryl in the third quarter, resulted in us maintaining the mid-point of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share on narrowing the range of $8.74 to $9.02 per share. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Julianne, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I was hoping you could discuss your seasonality assumptions and what you're expecting for the fourth quarter this year versus what you saw last year.\nTim Argo: Eric, can you repeat that a little -- I lost you a little bit there at the beginning.\nEric Wolfe: Sure. I was hoping you could discuss your seasonality assumptions and what you expect for the fourth quarter this year.\nTim Argo: Okay. Got you. Yes, I mean, I think from a seasonality standpoint, we've seen it play out kind of like we thought so far where we continue to see some acceleration through about this time of the year. And then I think as we get later into the fall and winter, we'll see that normal seasonality. Now having said that, and I alluded to it a little bit in my opening comments. We're in a really good spot right now with our current occupancy. We're in a good spot with exposure lower than what it was this time last year. And so we feel like with what we're seeing particularly, I mentioned to the asking rents for August are a little bit higher than what they were this time 12 months ago. It's the first time we've seen that 18 months. So I'd see that all to say, I think the normal seasonality, could extend out a little bit longer. July is typically when it peaks in a normal seasonality. We think that could extend for a month or six weeks or two months and then start to moderate as we get into the back half of the year. But the adjustments we made to the pricing guidance was really just on new lease pricing, and most of that was -- would occurred in the second quarter. We made a couple of minor tweaks to Q3 and Q4, but essentially held our expectations for what we saw for that. So net-net, it was really about a 100 basis point decrease in our new lease pricing assumption renewals holding steady, and that seasonality is standing out a little bit more than it typically would.\nEric Wolfe: Thanks. That's helpful. And then it looks like your guidance includes some uplift from other revenues. Could you just talk about what the opportunity looks like there and whether that contribution could potentially increase as we go into 2025.\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean I think it's not a huge piece. I mean, it's growing a little bit more than rents currently with where our occupancy is there's fee income, application fee, that sort of thing. So it's providing a little bit, nothing out of the ordinary, I think, in a normal environment, it would be somewhat in line with rents. I mean, we do have some opportunities over the long-term with Wi-Fi -- ubiquitous Wi-Fi that we're testing this year. And I think over the next several years that will be a big opportunity for us, but nothing material necessarily in the short-term.\nEric Wolfe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thank you. I just wanted to see, I think, I don't know if you gave this, apologies. But is there a way to get just sort of the blended lease pricing that is assumed to the back half of the year? I know you said you adjusted in the full year; I just want to make sure we're clear on that.\nTim Argo: Yes. So for blended for the back half of the year, we're on average were I would say this, for full year new lease we're somewhere in the 4.25% range, which is about 100 basis points lower than what it was in our original guidance. And we're still in that mid-4 to 5 range on renewals. And so somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% blended in the back half of the year is how that plays out.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just second question is, you talked about some of the markets where you're seeing more impact from supply, Austin, Atlanta, Jacksonville. As you look at some of the supply deliveries or what's happening with competitive concessions in those markets. I mean do you have any sort of visibility right now when you think some of those markets would be not as much of a drag on overall new lease pricing? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, I think all those markets are in somewhat of a similar timeline, saw similar peak and starts and deliveries that frankly, pretty consistent across the portfolio where we saw start peak in mid-2022 and kind of seeing the peak of it right now. So market like Austin still going to be elevated next year, not going to be quite as much supply as we had this year. Job growth is really strong. So I mean, I think for all three of those, in particular, I would expect 2025 to look better than what it does in 2024. It's not going to flip to be in our lead markets, but I think it will be more in line with the portfolio and be less of a drag in 2025 for sure.\nNick Yulico: And just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, is there anything you're seeing just on the ground right now that would point to some of that concessionary impact already easing? Or is it still a wait and see?\nTim Argo: Well, we haven't seen it get worse. We saw concessions pick up quite a bit in the back part of 2023 and then come back down, I would say, at early 2024 and then pretty steady throughout 2024. Somewhere -- broadly somewhere between half a month and a month is pretty consistent across markets. There are some pockets with more lease-ups, Downtown Austin probably closer to two months. Midtown Atlanta probably our worst concessionary environment right now, sometimes pushing three months where there's lease-ups, but not really any heavier than it was the last couple of quarters. And I think we're in a much more stable environment, both in terms of interest rates and when the supply picture is going to start to look better. So I don't see that necessarily getting any worse from here.\nEric Bolton: And Nick, this is Eric. Just to follow on what Tim is saying, last -- late last year in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty out there surrounding the demand side of the business and the overall economy and the job market and the supply delivery is really starting to make an impact. And I think that, that's what prompted a lot of pretty aggressive concessionary practices in the marketplace late last year. But as the year has continued to unfold, I think we've all been pleasantly surprised with the very strong demand that we continue to see taking place. Stability is more evident than I think people initially feared it was possible, and as a consequence of the strong demand that we're seeing and clear visibility that new supply deliveries are poised to start declining. I think the market is starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with the practices I have and the lease-up programs I have in place.\nNick Yulico: Thanks, Eric, Tim. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yes. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch based on the insurance renewal looked pretty favorable versus maybe what you were forecasting before. Just kind of any changes to maybe what you're covering or just any kind of color on how you got that pretty decent renewal.\nRob DelPriore: Yes, hi, Josh, this is Rob. I guess kind of framing it up, if you look at the last three years of insurance renewals in the aggregate, our costs have gone up about 50%. And we've had some good positive claims here. We've got long relationships -- positive relationships with our insurers. So I think given the claims history and where this wound up, we wound up with the same coverage levels that we had last year. And we just -- we caught a break with a kind of stabilizing insurance market and favorable claims history.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. All right. Great. And then on the real estate taxes, are there -- is there any more variability across the rest of the year? Or you kind of locked in at this point for the back half on real estate taxes? And then just how should we think about like maybe the cadence from here? I think some of the states have like different assessment times. So just trying to think through like maybe some kind of lag on a go-forward basis?\nClay Holder: Hey Josh, this is Clay. Yes, I think we have pretty good visibility across the portfolio at this point with the exception of Florida. And that's the one -- that's the one state that typically lags the rest. I think keep in mind now that Florida has a cap on their valuations. And so we have a pretty good idea of where they'll ultimately end up. We just don't have the final valuation onto at this point. The other missing piece is around the millage rates. And that's fairly across the Board. But we, again, kind of same story with Florida property valuations. We have pretty good visibility as to what we think that those will be as we wrap up the rest of this year.\nJosh Dennerlein: All right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It sounds like the adjustments to the guidance reflects the pressure in the first half and the original assumptions for the second half remain relatively unchanged. So what gives you confidence in that just given seasonal slowing trends and also elevated supply? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. And I mentioned a couple on that. I think, one, we're at a really good spot from an occupancy exposure standpoint. As we said here this time last year, we were a little bit more of a hole in terms of occupancy and exposure. We're in a better spot this year. And I think, frankly, a couple of things that I didn't mention in the prior question is about mid-July of last year is when new lease rates really started to drop off, they hit sort of a cliff there in mid-July and continue that way through December. So that frankly creates an easier comp scenario for us as well. So now as we sit here at the beginning of August, we're starting to lap some of those comparisons. And then I think as we've said, too, we do expect the impact from supply to start to moderate a little bit in the back part of the year. I mean it won't manifest itself too much with seasonality. But we were in a period of increasing supply this time last year, while we think we're in a little bit of a period of decreasing price from supply this year. So I think where we are with occupancy exposure the comps, the supply situation, and the continued demand turnover being low, more of our mixes and renewals, which continues to be our strongest point for pricing. Rent to income continuing to be solid. So don't see any change on the demand scenario either other than some of the normal seasonality that we'll see later this year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is on the renewals. How are they trending at an ask versus take rate basis? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Yes. So we were at 4% in June. We're actually 4% -- or in July, sorry, the next couple of months, August, September, where we expect to be in the 4% to 4.5% range with actually September being more towards the higher end of that range. So we're seeing -- and on top of that, our renewal accept rates are higher than they were last year, really higher than they've been in the last few years. So continue to see strength there and expect that to hold up pretty well through the rest of the year.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half.\nTim Argo: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I just want to talk some more about the development opportunities. I appreciate your comments of ramping up to $1 billion of potential spend. I think a lot of people are excited about all the major pullback in starts and what 2026, 2027 could look like in your markets. Can you talk more about how much more you think you could ramp up? Is the land already on your balance sheet? Would you need to go out and buy it? And just kind of how large and how would you fund as you throttle up the development pipeline?\nBrad Hill: Yes. Jamie, this is Brad. As we've said in the past, we would feel comfortable given our balance sheet strength and size really ramping up our development pipeline to about 4% to 5% of our enterprise value, which would take our pipeline to call it, $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and that's really what we've been working with over the last few years. We -- this time in 2022, our pipeline was about $450 million. And today, we've almost doubled that. So we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We do have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we've got a sufficient pipeline of owned and controlled sites on our balance sheet. We've got about 11 projects now that that we currently control. A number of those would be ready to start very quickly if construction costs come down or rents improve sufficiently enough to drive the returns up to where we think they need to be. So we've got a good pipeline ahead of us. We're in a really good spot. And Clay, I'll let you handle the other part of that question.\nClay Holder: Yes. Jamie, I'll add on to that as far as where we think that, that funding would come from, I mean, where we would look to first is to fund that through additional debt, given our leverage at the 3.7x. And so we would look to move that up at least to the 4.5x or maybe 5x. And that's a significant number. That's almost over $1 billion. So we've got plenty of opportunity there of how we would go about funding that. Especially in an environment where rates will -- we expect would continue to decline over the next year or so.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. So you mentioned if construction costs decline, I mean where do you -- what line items are you watching the most to see if they pull back, where would that be the most helpful.\nBrad Hill: Certainly, we don't need a lot of decrease in construction cost because the other piece of the puzzle, I think, that we're likely to see a little bit of improvement on is on the schedules side of things, which has extended a bit over the last few years just given the amount of product that's in the pipeline. So we don't need construction costs to come down a whole lot to make some of these projects feasible or to get the economics more in line. But -- and we have seen that. The project that we started in Charlotte in the second quarter, we saw construction costs come down a few million dollars. So we don't need it to come down a lot. I think where you're likely to see that is some of the margins for some of the contractors out there. We've seen those margins -- profit margins increased substantially over the last couple of years. I think framing and lumber and things of that nature are down right now. So I'm not sure you'll get a whole lot of that, but I think it's going to come from some of the margins.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then also, as we think about your historically low turnover, do you expect to maintain that kind of retention and renewal pricing power in a potentially lower interest rate environment despite some of the pent-up demand for homeownership. We're just trying to understand some of the key drivers that could pull that number back. And I don't know if it's in your surveys that you get when people move out or just your own tens of cycles. Is it -- is there a certain mortgage rate, we think will make a difference? Or just how are you guys thinking about it over the next year or so, if rates continue to decline or do decline?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, we certainly track the reason for move out as part -- when somebody does move out and track those reasons where they're trending. And certainly, the decrease and move out to my home has been helpful to overall turnover decreasing. So I mean, I do think it will tick back up if and when rates start to drop. I mean, it's still it probably needs to be a fairly material drop. If you think about single-family home prices even ignoring the level of interest rates. Those have continued to go up even as rents have started to moderate. And so with current interest rates, somebody buying a house is going to be -- their average payment is going to be about 40% to 50% higher than our average rent. So to fill that gap, it would take quite a decrease in interest rates. So I do expect at some point, turnover pick up a little bit, but usually when that happens, if interest rates are dropping, people buy in homes that typically speaks to a pretty strong economy as well. So we typically see that hold up okay as rents start to move as a part of that. So I don't think it would be as big of a -- I don't think it would be a one-for-one trade-off. It would have some benefits on the revenue side as well.\nEric Bolton: And Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim said. Right now, the median house principal interest payment in our markets is about 40% higher on average than our average rent. So there is a pretty significant modification or moderation in the purchase of single-family housing that's going to have to take place before I think we get back to the level of turnover that we saw going back four or five years ago, I think that we've been in a steady decline of resident turnover for quite a few years. And I think it will likewise take a few years to get back to perhaps where we were some years ago.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Great. Thanks for your thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Anderson from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So if you can help me sort of marry a few things here. It sounded very optimistic looking out beyond the near-term supply maximum impact to new lease is behind you, as you said, and August is looking good, yet you lowered your new lease rate guidance. I'm just curious, is this kind of like final hurdle to clear type of thing or the beatable situation in the back half of this year? I'm just curious if you can sort of bring those two pieces together for me?\nTim Argo: Yes. I'll comment just on the new lease rate piece. I mean, it was -- the biggest modification, if you will was the Q2 new lease rates being a little bit lower than what we had initially dialed in. And as I commented just people shopping a little longer, being a little more selective in this elevated environment, we tweaked new lease rate -- the cadence of new lease rates a little bit in the back half of the year, but I do think, as I said, that seasonality extends out a little more. So really, the impact to our -- to the revenue guidance and the new lease pricing was primarily what occurred in Q2, then you obviously had that carried over in the back half of the year, whereas as good or better new lease rates in the back half don't impact quite as much as the current year but certainly play into 2025.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Great. And then the second question is, when you think about kind of looking into 2025, just in your experience and history in dealing with pockets of supply that have happened in your careers many times you're accustomed to this. How does the cadence of 2025 kind of look when you think about what you know is coming to be delivered and then the tail of that as it leases up does 2025 sort of hit the ground running? Or is it sort of a slow evolution and you don't really get back to a real growth story of significance until a year into the year, if that makes sense.\nTim Argo: Yes, it does. I mean, I think the seasonality will be pretty typical and there will still be supply pressure next year. It's going to be less in, but it's not nothing. It's still going to be there. So I think what you'll see play out as -- particularly as we get into the spring and summer, that we'll start to see the new lease rates accelerate. We'll see that blended lease-over-lease improve, but that's going to obviously take 12 months kind of feed through all the leases. So what I would expect is to start to see some pricing power on blended lease-over-lease in spring, summer 2025 and then really not hugely play out in terms of revenue growth until you get late 2025 into 2026. And I think it really sets up for a good earn-in into 2026 and then even less supply pressure there where you really start to see that revenue growth pick up late 2025 and into 2026.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. Thanks, everybody. And piggyback a little bit off the last question there, Tim, and circling back to Tim's comments on asking rents turning positive in August. I guess with comps easing from here, what's sort of your expectation for the trend in asking rents through this year and into 2025 and maybe seasonality aside later this year, when do you expect positive asking rents to translate into positive new lease rate growth?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean I think similar probably gets into early mid next year. I mean, we have seen if you want to use kind of our new lease rates as a proxy for market rents. We have seen with where July new lease rents were about 4% or so higher than we were at the beginning of the year. So it's certainly closing that gap. And I don't -- it will moderate some in the winter time with the seasonality. But I would think probably it's going to be kind of spring, early summer that we start to see that manifest itself into positive new lease rates would be my guess.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And then I guess with this move in asking rents, where does that put the portfolio today from a loss or gain to lease perspective?\nTim Argo: If you look -- so if you look, be clear on how I'm defining this, if you look at all the leases we did in July, it's about 2% higher, so 2% loss to lease compared to our in-place rents. Certainly, we're sitting at kind of the peak demand, if you will, or the peak pricing and a typical seasonality. So I think that edges back down a little bit later in the year, but it's about 2% right now.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned absorption is the highest it's been since the third quarter of 2021. And I'm wondering what's driving this. A few years ago, we did have the strong net migration trends to your markets, but that seems to have softened a bit. So I just wanted to know what do you think is driving demand right now?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean I think it's a little bit a lot of factors. I mean we have -- job growth has been a little bit stronger. We still have certainly stronger job growth in our markets than the broader nationally. And even within migration, we saw it tick back up a little bit at 12% of our move-ins were from out of our footprint in Q2 into MAA, which is ticked up a little bit and back to where it was about 12 months ago, continue to see wage growth and population growth, household formation and then just the turnover being quite a bit lower, obviously, as well helps in that absorption as there's less existing units, if you will, to be absorbed that that spreads out into those new units coming online. So the absorption has been strong now for several quarters. It's keeping up, if you will, with the new supply, which is why we don't think it gets worse. But I think all those factors that I mentioned are combining to help drive that demand.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And I wanted to clarify your views on renewal rates. So you had 4.5% to 5% in the first half of the year. That's what you're expecting in the second half of the year. I think that's the answer you gave to Nick Yulico. But July opined to 4%. So I'm wondering why this month was relatively lower than what you're expecting. And are you basically expecting this to ramp up in the fourth quarter?\nTim Argo: Well, I mean, we have 4% to 5% is kind of our full year expectation. We are on the higher end of that in the first half of the year. I think, probably a little bit lower end of that in the back half of the year. But we are seeing, I think, August probably is a little better than July and September is trending a little bit better than August. So I do think as we get into the back part of the year, I mean, our renewals have always held up pretty strong. And with new lease rates increasing that that gap between the two has started to narrow a bit. So I think, again, with the easier comps, I think that will tend to help renewals as well. But -- so I think you start to trend a little bit more towards that 4.5% as you get right at the back quarter in late Q4.\nJohn Kim: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So first one, I guess, is on the transaction market cap rates. Seemed like early this year, cap rates were closer to 6%. Now we're getting into the low 5%. Interest rates coming down a bit more I wouldn't necessarily call it confidence or clarity, but a better feeling of how fundamentals could be trending in the Sunbelt over the next 6, 12 months. I'm curious. Are sellers now more willing to engage in not only conversations about selling assets? Do you expect the cap rate to be lower from here? And then some color on how you're underwriting IRRs for the assets you bought in the second quarter. Thanks.\nBrad Hill: Yes, Haendel, this is Brad. I think, certainly, the cap rates that we're seeing in the market are kind of in that 5% range, which, frankly, has been consistent for the last couple of quarters. I think we saw cap rates tick up a little bit in the fourth quarter of last year, and that's since come down around that 5% mark. So given where the expectations are with interest rates and some of the market not being quite as uncertain as it was last year. I mean I would expect cap rates to kind of stay in that range going forward. There is a lot of optimism as we've talked about in 2026/2027 fundamentals. And so that's certainly being reflected a bit in the transaction market. Interest rates today are, call it, in that 5.5%, 5.75% range. So there is a little bit of negative leverage that folks are willing to accept when there's growth on the horizon. So that's kind of where we're seeing cap rates today. In terms of where we're underwriting deals and the IRRs that we're looking at. So based on our kind of long-term cost of capital, our levered IRR hurdles, call it, 8%. Most of our acquisitions are delivering substantially more than that. North of that, just to remind you, we're not buying at 5 caps. The acquisitions that we've executed on and the ones that we have under contract today or in the NOI yields high 5%, close to 6% range. So we're not active at a 5 cap at the moment. But given where our cost of capital is we're achieving yields and IRRs substantially above our current cost of capital.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. You mentioned in your comments earlier that the rent to income in the portfolios around, I think you said 21%, the lowest in three years. I was curious if you're sensing any rent fatigue, any change in the move-outs due to rents you're seeing in the portfolio? And then can you add some color on concessions usage in the portfolio today, how that compares to last quarter or last year? Thanks.\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean we did see rent income drop in Q2, and that's based on all the residents that moved in, in Q2. And we track move-in -- our move-ins or move-outs due to rent increase is certainly down significantly. So I think that and the move-outs to buy a house are the two components that are driving the lower turnover as rental started to moderate. But on the concession question, pretty consistent for us as a portfolio, it's very minimal; somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% of overall rent is our concession practice. But as I alluded to a little bit earlier, I'd say, broadly, kind of half a month to month is pretty typical in most markets. There are a few pockets where you might see two where there's some lease-up scenarios, and I mentioned Midtown Atlanta is probably our worst we might see two to three kind of uptown South and Charlotte, kind of in that two-month range in downtown Austin in that two-month range. Those are the three pockets I would say; we're seeing a little bit higher concession usage. But overall, pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last -- all throughout 2024 I would say.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And one last one, I appreciate the commentary on the insurance costs coming in the commentary in the marketplace. So I'm curious if there's anything that perhaps you're doing any differently in your approach if you're perhaps self-insuring a bit more? Thanks.\nRob DelPriore: Hey Haendel, it's Rob again. Yes, our retentions are all the same as they were last year, one exception. We did have to increase our retention by $250,000 on our general liability to kind of our slip and fall protection there, just kind of got some pressure from the insurance companies to do that. But the rest of everything stayed the same in terms of what we're doing on retentions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great. Thanks, guys, and best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning, down there. Two questions. The first is bad debt. Can you just talk a bit about your resident credit profile now versus pre-pandemic? Are you back to where you were pre-pandemic? And if there are any markets in particular that are still elevated and thoughts on why any elevated markets are remain as such?\nTim Argo: Yes. We're mostly back to pre-pandemic level. I mean I think we're probably on average over the long-term, 10 to 15 bps higher in terms of delinquency than where we consistently were pre-COVID but you're talking about 0.3 to 0.4 maybe up to 0.5% of rent. So it's still very low for us and not much of an issue. Atlanta is the market has been talked about a lot that has had more pressure. We actually saw that drop to about 0.5% of rents in Q2 down from about 1.3% where it was a year ago. So I think the practices we've put in place to try to sort of catch that fraud before they come in the front door, and it's starting to play out and help us there. So outside of that, not a lot of pressure across portfolio, and it continues to be mostly a non-issue for us.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And just confirming what you said. You said normal bad debt is 30 to 40 bps and currently, you're 15 above that. I just want to make sure I heard that right.\nTim Argo: Well, I would say, our delinquency in Q2, I think was around 0.3% or 0.4%. There's a little bit of seasonality too. I would say pre-COVID, longer-term, delinquency was somewhere in the 0.3 range. I would guess, long-term in this new environment is probably between 0.4, 0.5 roughly.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then second question is a lot of discussion on the call about the changes in your same-store assumptions changes in rent profile and occupancy. And yet big picture is your FFO mid-point stayed the same and that's despite $0.03 hurricane charge in the third quarter. So I mean it sounds like there's a lot of focus on same-store, but ultimately to earnings, it's almost a non-issue. So what's the best way you gave a lot of stats on rents, on revenue, occupancy, et cetera? But ultimately, it matters what you guys deliver on the bottom line. So what's really the key focus or the key driver of the FFO versus all these puts and takes?\nClay Holder: Yes. Alex, just a couple of points that I would make. I mean, obviously, the revenue plays into that. And so as we kind of dial those in and adjusted for that first half performance and what it's going to look like in the back half of the year, and then achieving what we were looking forward for the back half of the year. Those will all play into that from a revenue standpoint. We feel good about all that. That feels very achievable and for all the reasons that Tim previously mentioned, we feel like that's in a good spot. And you kind of get down into the operating expense section, we talked about the real estate taxes and the insurance renewal. Those are really kind of -- those two things are really offsetting the changes that we have adjusted for and the revenue guidance. And so if you look back at kind of where we've been running and trending in personal costs, repair and maintenance costs started with the first half of the year, there is potential upside there. We've -- but we'll see how that plays out. But those two things can really talking to each other and offsetting one another, then it just gets down into below the line there. And then there's been some favorable G&A costs, interest expense, and some other items that's really offsetting that $0.03 that we noted for the hurricane during the third quarter.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. And overall --\nEric Bolton: Alex, this is Eric. Just to add to what Clay is saying. I mean, what really drives FFO performance long-term is NOI. And as you point out, I mean, a lot of gives and takes and lot of details that we dig into and the market most part trying to understand sort of what's driving that NOI. But for me, sort of the key takeaway is that in the midst of clearly what sort of record levels of new supply coming into our market. And we kind of feel like we're in the worst of the storm right now. We think that we're seeing sort of bottoming out occurring as it relates to sort of what's happening with new lease pricing. And we think that, particularly as you get into next year, we think that new lease price is going to hang in there. Next year, we think it starts to really take off. It will take a while for it to really build into revenues and ultimately into NOI just because of seasonal factors. But when you look at what's happening with new lease pricing and recognizing we're kind of the worst of the storm now, renewal pricing is hanging in there, and we do think that we are likely going to see continued relief on the overall operating expense side of the business as a function of some of the new technology we continue to introduce as well as inflationary pressures beginning to moderate. So ultimately, what really drives FFO is NOI, same-store NOI. And we think that when you look at the variables that make up that NOI performance, we think that it's poised to really show some recovery over the next few years.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks. I want to ask about the delta between the commenced and the signed leases in July?\nTim Argo: Say that again, the delta between what?\nAdam Kramer: Yes. Just between the leases that were signed in July and the leases that were commenced or effective in July, what you reported?\nTim Argo: There's about a 50 basis point delta. So I mean, obviously, with sign, you've got some that will go in effect into that month and some that will go effect later, could be ones that end up getting canceled. So we don't -- we frankly don't pay a ton of attention to sign, but that's what the delta is.\nAdam Kramer: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about some of capital allocation from a high level, maybe a little bit of focus on this call on development and maybe the possibility of leaning a little bit more into that. So I guess, just kind of given kind of where acquisitions and cap rates are today and maybe that market showing some green shoots given the development opportunity that you talked about, how would you kind of stack rank those two and any other kind of capital allocation opportunities and priorities.\nBrad Hill: Yes, Adam, this is Brad. Well, I think our plan from a capital allocation perspective is to certainly continue to allocate both to acquisition and development. We would like to lean a little bit more into the acquisition area given just the immediacy of earnings associated with that. But honestly, given the returns that we've been able to achieve, where our yields are 6% and the market was substantially less than that, we've been a little bit slower in the acquisition market, I still feel good about our guidance for the year at $400 million development. Again, we've seen opportunities there that have really come up. We've got additional opportunities that we're looking at where developers -- third-party developers are not able to get their financing lined up. And so we're seeing additional opportunities come to us through that area. So I wouldn't be surprised if in the short-term we do find additional development opportunities versus acquisition. But from a long-term perspective, we like both of those avenues. And I think generally, they'll be pretty evenly split in terms of the acquisition in development on our spend on a yearly basis.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning. My question is more from a regulatory perspective. Again, you have President Biden up there kind of talking about implementing further rent control. We're going into an election cycle. Just curious what you think about that? And specifically, if you're also kind of hearing anything in any of your key states where you have exposure about potential rent control laws and kind of going into this current election cycle.\nRob DelPriore: Hi Omotayo, it's Rob. I'll start off, I guess, with President Biden's 5% rent control proposal. And we do think that there's some election year politicking going on there. It does require an active Congress that in this year with the divided Congress. We don\u2019t really see that -- that, that particular effort will gain a lot of traction at the federal level and then following-up on your state-level question. 13 of the states where we operate that represents about 90% of our NOI as a state-level prohibition on local rent control. So we're really not seeing any movement at the state level. And in most of the instances, it's blocked at the local level. So in terms of rent control, we're not that concerned about the impact of rent control on our markets.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ann Chan from Green Street. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAnn Chan: Hey, good morning. Quick question for me. Do you expect a reacceleration in growth of any expense line items heading into next year?\nClay Holder: This is Clay. We kind of look at it next year, we think that, that property taxes, I'll start there since it's the biggest line item. But the property taxes will continue to run in this 3% to 4% range as we've adjusted our guidance is at 4% today. We think it can run probably in there for a period of time, especially given what we've seen and just for the property performance over these past couple of years given the high supply and seeing some of those income levels come down from those properties. Insurance, we saw -- we had our renewal this year, so we'll enjoy a little bit of that going into the first half of next year as well. And then it will be another negotiation at that point. And look, I wouldn't expect it to be necessarily another decrease by any stretch, but I also don't know that we would expect to see levels of what we saw in the couple of -- past couple of years of 15%, 20%. So I think it would be a much more reasonable growth with that level, assuming claims experience stays pretty effective with what they've been for us in the past. And then looking at personnel costs, repair and maintenance, marketing costs and those types of items, we think that those will continue to run at a pretty normal rate. We've seen some moderation in all those mix categories over the past year. And so we would think that those -- we would definitely would expect those to jump to a level of what they were going around 2021, 2022. So big more of the 3% to 4% growth range there.\nAnn Chan: Thanks. And second question, Tim, can you share what your expectations are for new lease growth in Atlanta for this year? And when you believe the markets will start seeing a stronger rate and occupancy trends?\nTim Argo: Yes. I mean, Atlanta has been pretty -- new lease rates has been pretty consistently high-single-digits in the negative -- high negative single-digits in the negative 8% to 9% range. We've seen it improve a little bit the last couple of months, and we've seen a little bit of traction in occupancy in July for Atlanta. So I think it will follow a similar trend in terms of the slowly getting better and starting to show some signs as we get into 2025, but probably take a little while for that one to get back to positive, a little bit longer than some of the other markets we're looking at.\nAnn Chan: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLinda Tsai: Yes. Hi, where are you sending out renewals for August? And what are you getting for those? And how does that compare to last year and historically?\nTim Argo: So for both August, September, we're getting in the 4% to 4.5% range. We sent out around 4% and depending on who accepts and what lease term. That's how you can get a variance there. But -- so I think this time last year, it was somewhere around 4.5% to 5%, so we're a little bit shy of that, but expect to be in that 4% to 4.5% range for a period of time.\nLinda Tsai: And then with rent to income dropping to 21%, do you track how much average incomes of your residents have increased over the past few years?\nTim Argo: Yes, we do. It is -- so right now, in Q2, we're about $91,000 or so is the average income that was -- if I go back to beginning of -- kind of right at the beginning of COVID, beginning of 2020, it was about $75,000. So it has trended up quite a bit and generally followed rent growth pretty well because as we said, that rent income ratio has been between, call it, 20% and 23% for the last four or five years. So it's pretty consistent across the market. I think our highest is 24% our lowest is 19%. So it's pretty consistent across markets as well.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will turn the call to MAA for closing remarks.\nEric Bolton: Okay. No further comments and we appreciate everyone joining us reach out if you have any other questions you'd like to ask. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's program.

            "name": "Rob DelPriore",
            "content": "Yes, hi, Josh, this is Rob. I guess kind of framing it up, if you look at the last three years of insurance renewals in the aggregate, our costs have gone up about 50%. And we've had some good positive claims here. We've got long relationships -- positive relationships with our insurers. So I think given the claims history and where this wound up, we wound up with the same coverage levels that we had last year. And we just -- we caught a break with a kind of stabilizing insurance market and favorable claims history. Hey Haendel, it's Rob again. Yes, our retentions are all the same as they were last year, one exception. We did have to increase our retention by $250,000 on our general liability to kind of our slip and fall protection there, just kind of got some pressure from the insurance companies to do that. But the rest of everything stayed the same in terms of what we're doing on retentions. Hi Omotayo, it's Rob. I'll start off, I guess, with President Biden's 5% rent control proposal. And we do think that there's some election year politicking going on there. It does require an active Congress that in this year with the divided Congress. We don't really see that -- that, that particular effort will gain a lot of traction at the federal level and then following-up on your state-level question. 13 of the states where we operate that represents about 90% of our NOI as a state-level prohibition on local rent control. So we're really not seeing any movement at the state level. And in most of the instances, it's blocked at the local level. So in terms of rent control, we're not that concerned about the impact of rent control on our markets."

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Core FFO results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as the strong demand for apartment housing across our markets is steadily absorbing the new supply being delivered. This strong demand continues to support steady occupancy performance from our portfolio as well as blended lease-over-lease pricing that has consistently increased since Q4 of last year. These positive trends are continuing into July. MAA's strategy has long focused on positioning our portfolio to capture higher full cycle demand to drive superior long-term value growth. To best mitigate the occasional periods of supply pressure, we have a unique portfolio diversification strategy involving both large and mid-tier markets. Further by appealing to a broad segment of the rental market with a more affordable price point, as evidenced by our strong rent income ratios and sector leading low delinquency performance, we believe, we are able to drive higher demand and absorption across our portfolio. We continue to believe that new supply deliveries across our markets are currently peaking and we expect to see the volume of new deliveries decline over the back half of this year with 2025 ushering in a multi-year period where the growing demand for apartment housing will exceed the level of new competing supply. As detailed in yesterday's earnings release, we continue to find compelling opportunities to deploy capital in new acquisitions and development that will, we believe, deliver meaningful earnings accretion over the next few years. Our balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to deliver on this future value pipeline that we are building. We believe that with the combination of the evolving market conditions poised to decline with the level of new supply delivering across our markets, the redevelopment and repositioning opportunities available to harvest within our existing portfolio, and the new growth pipeline that we're building through in-house development, our pre-purchase program with third-party developers, and the acquisition of newly constructed properties, MAA is positioned for meaningful growth and value over the next few years. Before turning the call over to Brad, Tim, and Clay for more details, I'd like to send my thanks and appreciation to our MAA associates for their dedication and tremendous service to our residents. MAA is capturing record levels of resident retention, high resident satisfaction ratings, and strong lease renewal performance, thanks in large part to your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Brad. And Nick, this is Eric. Just to follow on what Tim is saying, last -- late last year in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty out there surrounding the demand side of the business and the overall economy and the job market and the supply delivery is really starting to make an impact. And I think that, that's what prompted a lot of pretty aggressive concessionary practices in the marketplace late last year. But as the year has continued to unfold, I think we've all been pleasantly surprised with the very strong demand that we continue to see taking place. Stability is more evident than I think people initially feared it was possible, and as a consequence of the strong demand that we're seeing and clear visibility that new supply deliveries are poised to start declining. I think the market is starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with the practices I have and the lease-up programs I have in place. And Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim said. Right now, the median house principal interest payment in our markets is about 40% higher on average than our average rent. So there is a pretty significant modification or moderation in the purchase of single-family housing that's going to have to take place before I think we get back to the level of turnover that we saw going back four or five years ago, I think that we've been in a steady decline of resident turnover for quite a few years. And I think it will likewise take a few years to get back to perhaps where we were some years ago. Alex, this is Eric. Just to add to what Clay is saying. I mean, what really drives FFO performance long-term is NOI. And as you point out, I mean, a lot of gives and takes and lot of details that we dig into and the market most part trying to understand sort of what's driving that NOI. But for me, sort of the key takeaway is that in the midst of clearly what sort of record levels of new supply coming into our market. And we kind of feel like we're in the worst of the storm right now. We think that we're seeing sort of bottoming out occurring as it relates to sort of what's happening with new lease pricing. And we think that, particularly as you get into next year, we think that new lease price is going to hang in there. Next year, we think it starts to really take off. It will take a while for it to really build into revenues and ultimately into NOI just because of seasonal factors. But when you look at what's happening with new lease pricing and recognizing we're kind of the worst of the storm now, renewal pricing is hanging in there, and we do think that we are likely going to see continued relief on the overall operating expense side of the business as a function of some of the new technology we continue to introduce as well as inflationary pressures beginning to moderate. So ultimately, what really drives FFO is NOI, same-store NOI. And we think that when you look at the variables that make up that NOI performance, we think that it's poised to really show some recovery over the next few years. Okay. No further comments and we appreciate everyone joining us reach out if you have any other questions you'd like to ask. Thanks very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see solid demand in our markets supported by strong household formation and positive wage and job growth, leading to continued blended pricing momentum in July with stable occupancy. MAA's long-term strategy positions our portfolio as an attractive lower cost alternative to the higher priced new multi-family supply being delivered, as well as the available single-family housing options within our markets. Our renewal accept rates are at a record high and our Google scores continue to lead the sector, evidence of the value our residents find in living with MAA. With the backdoor controlled, we're very focused on the front door and encouraged by the improving traffic trends. Our property tours are higher than this time last year and our conversion of leads into leases is also up. With increased traffic, strong conversion, stable occupancy and lower exposure, our properties are well-positioned as we enter the back half of the year. As indicated in our release, we have made progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In addition to the two second quarter construction starts that bring our under construction pipeline at the end of the second quarter to 2,617 units at a cost of $866 million. In July, we provided financing to take out the equity partner on a 239 unit under construction development in the SouthPark area of Charlotte. The project suffered an early delay that put the project's investment horizon outside of the equities fund horizon. Our previous relationship with the developer and the equity partner provided us the unique opportunity to invest in an under construction project with no entitlement risk and a materially shortened construction schedule with first units scheduled to deliver in second quarter of 2025. The second quarter development starts -- the two second quarter development starts were expected to deliver first units in mid-2026 and all three projects are expected to deliver average initial stabilized NOI yields around 6.4%, similar to what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing. While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment, rents achieved at our developments are well above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOIs that should deliver stabilized NOI yields that exceed our original expectations by approximately 70 basis points. Pre-development work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which has increased to 11 projects, representing additional growth of over 3,100 units. We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, but we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year, bringing our development starts for the year to four to five at or slightly above our original guidance for the year and leading to a slight increase in our development spend for the year at $350 million. Construction costs have yet to decline broadly. But we are hopeful that as the current under construction pipeline winds down, we could see more improvement in construction costs and schedules as we progress through the year, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields. In the transaction market, volume remains low with cap rates generally in the low 5% range, with a number of transactions occurring well below 5%. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities generally in lease-up and on an aftermarket base -- on an off-market basis. In the second quarter, we closed on a 306 unit suburban property in Raleigh for approximately $81 million, which is 15% to 20% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease-up and finished the quarter at 62% occupied. We have two additional acquisition opportunities in due diligence and upon successfully concluding our inspections we expect the closings to occur over the next few months. The three acquisitions are expected to deliver stabilized NOI yields on average just under 6%. Based on the activity our team is seeing in the market, we believe, our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. We have two dispositions in the market, one in Charlotte and one in Richmond that we hope to execute on by the end of the year, but we are early in the process. Before I turn the call over to Tim, to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices, I want to say thank you for your hard work and dedication that you show on a daily basis to our prospects, residents, and fellow associates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim. Yes. Jamie, this is Brad. As we've said in the past, we would feel comfortable given our balance sheet strength and size really ramping up our development pipeline to about 4% to 5% of our enterprise value, which would take our pipeline to call it, $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and that's really what we've been working with over the last few years. We -- this time in 2022, our pipeline was about $450 million. And today, we've almost doubled that. So we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We do have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we've got a sufficient pipeline of owned and controlled sites on our balance sheet. We've got about 11 projects now that that we currently control. A number of those would be ready to start very quickly if construction costs come down or rents improve sufficiently enough to drive the returns up to where we think they need to be. So we've got a good pipeline ahead of us. We're in a really good spot. And Clay, I'll let you handle the other part of that question. Certainly, we don't need a lot of decrease in construction cost because the other piece of the puzzle, I think, that we're likely to see a little bit of improvement on is on the schedules side of things, which has extended a bit over the last few years just given the amount of product that's in the pipeline. So we don't need construction costs to come down a whole lot to make some of these projects feasible or to get the economics more in line. But -- and we have seen that. The project that we started in Charlotte in the second quarter, we saw construction costs come down a few million dollars. So we don't need it to come down a lot. I think where you're likely to see that is some of the margins for some of the contractors out there. We've seen those margins -- profit margins increased substantially over the last couple of years. I think framing and lumber and things of that nature are down right now. So I'm not sure you'll get a whole lot of that, but I think it's going to come from some of the margins. Yes, Haendel, this is Brad. I think, certainly, the cap rates that we're seeing in the market are kind of in that 5% range, which, frankly, has been consistent for the last couple of quarters. I think we saw cap rates tick up a little bit in the fourth quarter of last year, and that's since come down around that 5% mark. So given where the expectations are with interest rates and some of the market not being quite as uncertain as it was last year. I mean I would expect cap rates to kind of stay in that range going forward. There is a lot of optimism as we've talked about in 2026/2027 fundamentals. And so that's certainly being reflected a bit in the transaction market. Interest rates today are, call it, in that 5.5%, 5.75% range. So there is a little bit of negative leverage that folks are willing to accept when there's growth on the horizon. So that's kind of where we're seeing cap rates today. In terms of where we're underwriting deals and the IRRs that we're looking at. So based on our kind of long-term cost of capital, our levered IRR hurdles, call it, 8%. Most of our acquisitions are delivering substantially more than that. North of that, just to remind you, we're not buying at 5 caps. The acquisitions that we've executed on and the ones that we have under contract today or in the NOI yields high 5%, close to 6% range. So we're not active at a 5 cap at the moment. But given where our cost of capital is we're achieving yields and IRRs substantially above our current cost of capital. Yes, Adam, this is Brad. Well, I think our plan from a capital allocation perspective is to certainly continue to allocate both to acquisition and development. We would like to lean a little bit more into the acquisition area given just the immediacy of earnings associated with that. But honestly, given the returns that we've been able to achieve, where our yields are 6% and the market was substantially less than that, we've been a little bit slower in the acquisition market, I still feel good about our guidance for the year at $400 million development. Again, we've seen opportunities there that have really come up. We've got additional opportunities that we're looking at where developers -- third-party developers are not able to get their financing lined up. And so we're seeing additional opportunities come to us through that area. So I wouldn't be surprised if in the short-term we do find additional development opportunities versus acquisition. But from a long-term perspective, we like both of those avenues. And I think generally, they'll be pretty evenly split in terms of the acquisition in development on our spend on a yearly basis."

            "name": "Tim Argo",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As previously referenced, demand in our markets continue to be strong as evidenced by steadily improving lease-over-lease rates on new move-in residents and stable lease-over-lease rates on renewal residents. Pricing growth does continue to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but showed improvement over the first quarter as traffic patterns increased. These factors contributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of minus 5.1%, with renewal rates for the quarter staying strong, growing 4.6% on a lease-over-lease basis. These two components resulted in lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis that was an improvement of 70 basis points from the first quarter. Average physical occupancy was 95.5%, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same-store revenue growth of 0.7%. Our unique market diversification strategy that Eric mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. While some of our larger markets are being more heavily impacted by new supply deliveries, many of our mid-tier metros remain steady. Similar to last quarter, Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets and diversification of submarkets within the market help strengthen performance through the cycle. Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets. While we have slowed some of our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives, in this elevated supply environment, we do continue to execute where it makes sense with the expectation of reaccelerating next year. For the second quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,700 interior unit upgrades; achieving rent increases more than 8% above non-upgraded units. For our repositioning program, we have three active projects that are in the repricing phase. We will begin construction on an additional six projects in the third quarter with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025 in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment. With July now wrapped up, we're encouraged by the early third quarter trends. Average physical occupancy for the month of July of 95.5% is in line with second quarter and current occupancy is 95.8%. This stability in occupancy combined with the lower 60-day exposure that Brad noted sets us up for more pricing power for the remainder of the summer as we also start to lap weaker new lease pricing that became evident beginning in August of last year. Accordingly, July, blended pricing of positive 0.3% is up from the first and second quarters and the month of June. And new lease pricing has improved each month since March. Furthermore, the year-over-year change in asking rents for August is expected to be positive for the first time since February of 2023, 18 months ago. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, and it is resulting in prospects shopping longer and being more selective. However, we still believe the long-term outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter. That is, we expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, but we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease-over-lease pricing growth and that the supply/demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in mid-2022 and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction start. While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the second quarter in our markets was the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Wage growth remained strong with our rent to income ratio in the second quarter dropping a bit to 21%, the lowest level in three years. Additionally, we saw resident turnover continued to decline in the second quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. The 12.4% of move-outs in the second quarter that were due to resident buying a home was the lowest ever for MAA, slightly lower than what we saw in the first quarter. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay. Eric, can you repeat that a little -- I lost you a little bit there at the beginning. Okay. Got you. Yes, I mean, I think from a seasonality standpoint, we've seen it play out kind of like we thought so far where we continue to see some acceleration through about this time of the year. And then I think as we get later into the fall and winter, we'll see that normal seasonality. Now having said that, and I alluded to it a little bit in my opening comments. We're in a really good spot right now with our current occupancy. We're in a good spot with exposure lower than what it was this time last year. And so we feel like with what we're seeing particularly, I mentioned to the asking rents for August are a little bit higher than what they were this time 12 months ago. It's the first time we've seen that 18 months. So I'd see that all to say, I think the normal seasonality, could extend out a little bit longer. July is typically when it peaks in a normal seasonality. We think that could extend for a month or six weeks or two months and then start to moderate as we get into the back half of the year. But the adjustments we made to the pricing guidance was really just on new lease pricing, and most of that was -- would occurred in the second quarter. We made a couple of minor tweaks to Q3 and Q4, but essentially held our expectations for what we saw for that. So net-net, it was really about a 100 basis point decrease in our new lease pricing assumption renewals holding steady, and that seasonality is standing out a little bit more than it typically would. Yes. I mean I think it's not a huge piece. I mean, it's growing a little bit more than rents currently with where our occupancy is there's fee income, application fee, that sort of thing. So it's providing a little bit, nothing out of the ordinary, I think, in a normal environment, it would be somewhat in line with rents. I mean, we do have some opportunities over the long-term with Wi-Fi -- ubiquitous Wi-Fi that we're testing this year. And I think over the next several years that will be a big opportunity for us, but nothing material necessarily in the short-term. Yes. So for blended for the back half of the year, we're on average were I would say this, for full year new lease we're somewhere in the 4.25% range, which is about 100 basis points lower than what it was in our original guidance. And we're still in that mid-4 to 5 range on renewals. And so somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% blended in the back half of the year is how that plays out. Yes. I mean, I think all those markets are in somewhat of a similar timeline, saw similar peak and starts and deliveries that frankly, pretty consistent across the portfolio where we saw start peak in mid-2022 and kind of seeing the peak of it right now. So market like Austin still going to be elevated next year, not going to be quite as much supply as we had this year. Job growth is really strong. So I mean, I think for all three of those, in particular, I would expect 2025 to look better than what it does in 2024. It's not going to flip to be in our lead markets, but I think it will be more in line with the portfolio and be less of a drag in 2025 for sure. Well, we haven't seen it get worse. We saw concessions pick up quite a bit in the back part of 2023 and then come back down, I would say, at early 2024 and then pretty steady throughout 2024. Somewhere -- broadly somewhere between half a month and a month is pretty consistent across markets. There are some pockets with more lease-ups, Downtown Austin probably closer to two months. Midtown Atlanta probably our worst concessionary environment right now, sometimes pushing three months where there's lease-ups, but not really any heavier than it was the last couple of quarters. And I think we're in a much more stable environment, both in terms of interest rates and when the supply picture is going to start to look better. So I don't see that necessarily getting any worse from here. Yes, this is Tim. And I mentioned a couple on that. I think, one, we're at a really good spot from an occupancy exposure standpoint. As we said here this time last year, we were a little bit more of a hole in terms of occupancy and exposure. We're in a better spot this year. And I think, frankly, a couple of things that I didn't mention in the prior question is about mid-July of last year is when new lease rates really started to drop off, they hit sort of a cliff there in mid-July and continue that way through December. So that frankly creates an easier comp scenario for us as well. So now as we sit here at the beginning of August, we're starting to lap some of those comparisons. And then I think as we've said, too, we do expect the impact from supply to start to moderate a little bit in the back part of the year. I mean it won't manifest itself too much with seasonality. But we were in a period of increasing supply this time last year, while we think we're in a little bit of a period of decreasing price from supply this year. So I think where we are with occupancy exposure the comps, the supply situation, and the continued demand turnover being low, more of our mixes and renewals, which continues to be our strongest point for pricing. Rent to income continuing to be solid. So don't see any change on the demand scenario either other than some of the normal seasonality that we'll see later this year. Yes. So we were at 4% in June. We're actually 4% -- or in July, sorry, the next couple of months, August, September, where we expect to be in the 4% to 4.5% range with actually September being more towards the higher end of that range. So we're seeing -- and on top of that, our renewal accept rates are higher than they were last year, really higher than they've been in the last few years. So continue to see strength there and expect that to hold up pretty well through the rest of the year. Thanks. Yes. I mean, we certainly track the reason for move out as part -- when somebody does move out and track those reasons where they're trending. And certainly, the decrease and move out to my home has been helpful to overall turnover decreasing. So I mean, I do think it will tick back up if and when rates start to drop. I mean, it's still it probably needs to be a fairly material drop. If you think about single-family home prices even ignoring the level of interest rates. Those have continued to go up even as rents have started to moderate. And so with current interest rates, somebody buying a house is going to be -- their average payment is going to be about 40% to 50% higher than our average rent. So to fill that gap, it would take quite a decrease in interest rates. So I do expect at some point, turnover pick up a little bit, but usually when that happens, if interest rates are dropping, people buy in homes that typically speaks to a pretty strong economy as well. So we typically see that hold up okay as rents start to move as a part of that. So I don't think it would be as big of a -- I don't think it would be a one-for-one trade-off. It would have some benefits on the revenue side as well. Yes. I'll comment just on the new lease rate piece. I mean, it was -- the biggest modification, if you will was the Q2 new lease rates being a little bit lower than what we had initially dialed in. And as I commented just people shopping a little longer, being a little more selective in this elevated environment, we tweaked new lease rate -- the cadence of new lease rates a little bit in the back half of the year, but I do think, as I said, that seasonality extends out a little more. So really, the impact to our -- to the revenue guidance and the new lease pricing was primarily what occurred in Q2, then you obviously had that carried over in the back half of the year, whereas as good or better new lease rates in the back half don't impact quite as much as the current year but certainly play into 2025. Yes, it does. I mean, I think the seasonality will be pretty typical and there will still be supply pressure next year. It's going to be less in, but it's not nothing. It's still going to be there. So I think what you'll see play out as -- particularly as we get into the spring and summer, that we'll start to see the new lease rates accelerate. We'll see that blended lease-over-lease improve, but that's going to obviously take 12 months kind of feed through all the leases. So what I would expect is to start to see some pricing power on blended lease-over-lease in spring, summer 2025 and then really not hugely play out in terms of revenue growth until you get late 2025 into 2026. And I think it really sets up for a good earn-in into 2026 and then even less supply pressure there where you really start to see that revenue growth pick up late 2025 and into 2026. Yes. I mean I think similar probably gets into early mid next year. I mean, we have seen if you want to use kind of our new lease rates as a proxy for market rents. We have seen with where July new lease rents were about 4% or so higher than we were at the beginning of the year. So it's certainly closing that gap. And I don't -- it will moderate some in the winter time with the seasonality. But I would think probably it's going to be kind of spring, early summer that we start to see that manifest itself into positive new lease rates would be my guess. If you look -- so if you look, be clear on how I'm defining this, if you look at all the leases we did in July, it's about 2% higher, so 2% loss to lease compared to our in-place rents. Certainly, we're sitting at kind of the peak demand, if you will, or the peak pricing and a typical seasonality. So I think that edges back down a little bit later in the year, but it's about 2% right now. Yes. I mean I think it's a little bit a lot of factors. I mean we have -- job growth has been a little bit stronger. We still have certainly stronger job growth in our markets than the broader nationally. And even within migration, we saw it tick back up a little bit at 12% of our move-ins were from out of our footprint in Q2 into MAA, which is ticked up a little bit and back to where it was about 12 months ago, continue to see wage growth and population growth, household formation and then just the turnover being quite a bit lower, obviously, as well helps in that absorption as there's less existing units, if you will, to be absorbed that that spreads out into those new units coming online. So the absorption has been strong now for several quarters. It's keeping up, if you will, with the new supply, which is why we don't think it gets worse. But I think all those factors that I mentioned are combining to help drive that demand. Well, I mean, we have 4% to 5% is kind of our full year expectation. We are on the higher end of that in the first half of the year. I think, probably a little bit lower end of that in the back half of the year. But we are seeing, I think, August probably is a little better than July and September is trending a little bit better than August. So I do think as we get into the back part of the year, I mean, our renewals have always held up pretty strong. And with new lease rates increasing that that gap between the two has started to narrow a bit. So I think, again, with the easier comps, I think that will tend to help renewals as well. But -- so I think you start to trend a little bit more towards that 4.5% as you get right at the back quarter in late Q4. Yes. I mean we did see rent income drop in Q2, and that's based on all the residents that moved in, in Q2. And we track move-in -- our move-ins or move-outs due to rent increase is certainly down significantly. So I think that and the move-outs to buy a house are the two components that are driving the lower turnover as rental started to moderate. But on the concession question, pretty consistent for us as a portfolio, it's very minimal; somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% of overall rent is our concession practice. But as I alluded to a little bit earlier, I'd say, broadly, kind of half a month to month is pretty typical in most markets. There are a few pockets where you might see two where there's some lease-up scenarios, and I mentioned Midtown Atlanta is probably our worst we might see two to three kind of uptown South and Charlotte, kind of in that two-month range in downtown Austin in that two-month range. Those are the three pockets I would say; we're seeing a little bit higher concession usage. But overall, pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last -- all throughout 2024 I would say. Yes. We're mostly back to pre-pandemic level. I mean I think we're probably on average over the long-term, 10 to 15 bps higher in terms of delinquency than where we consistently were pre-COVID but you're talking about 0.3 to 0.4 maybe up to 0.5% of rent. So it's still very low for us and not much of an issue. Atlanta is the market has been talked about a lot that has had more pressure. We actually saw that drop to about 0.5% of rents in Q2 down from about 1.3% where it was a year ago. So I think the practices we've put in place to try to sort of catch that fraud before they come in the front door, and it's starting to play out and help us there. So outside of that, not a lot of pressure across portfolio, and it continues to be mostly a non-issue for us. Well, I would say, our delinquency in Q2, I think was around 0.3% or 0.4%. There's a little bit of seasonality too. I would say pre-COVID, longer-term, delinquency was somewhere in the 0.3 range. I would guess, long-term in this new environment is probably between 0.4, 0.5 roughly. Say that again, the delta between what? There's about a 50 basis point delta. So I mean, obviously, with sign, you've got some that will go in effect into that month and some that will go effect later, could be ones that end up getting canceled. So we don't -- we frankly don't pay a ton of attention to sign, but that's what the delta is. Yes. I mean, Atlanta has been pretty -- new lease rates has been pretty consistently high-single-digits in the negative -- high negative single-digits in the negative 8% to 9% range. We've seen it improve a little bit the last couple of months, and we've seen a little bit of traction in occupancy in July for Atlanta. So I think it will follow a similar trend in terms of the slowly getting better and starting to show some signs as we get into 2025, but probably take a little while for that one to get back to positive, a little bit longer than some of the other markets we're looking at. So for both August, September, we're getting in the 4% to 4.5% range. We sent out around 4% and depending on who accepts and what lease term. That's how you can get a variance there. But -- so I think this time last year, it was somewhere around 4.5% to 5%, so we're a little bit shy of that, but expect to be in that 4% to 4.5% range for a period of time. Yes, we do. It is -- so right now, in Q2, we're about $91,000 or so is the average income that was -- if I go back to beginning of -- kind of right at the beginning of COVID, beginning of 2020, it was about $75,000. So it has trended up quite a bit and generally followed rent growth pretty well because as we said, that rent income ratio has been between, call it, 20% and 23% for the last four or five years. So it's pretty consistent across the market. I think our highest is 24% our lowest is 19%. So it's pretty consistent across markets as well."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.03 per share above the mid-point of our second quarter guidance. Just under $0.02 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses and $0.015 was driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense, and non-operating income partially offset by about $0.01 in storm cost. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, we saw sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in both blended pricing and occupancy while same-store revenues again benefited from strong rent collections. Our same-store expense performance, particularly in repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and personnel costs was favorable compared to our expectations for the quarter. Repair and maintenance costs continue to show moderation growing at 1.8% compared to second quarter last year. At this point in the year, we have better visibility into our real estate tax expense for 2024, which we will discuss more with our revised guidance in a moment. During the quarter, we funded nearly $80 million of development cost of the current expected $866 million pipeline, leaving an expected $328 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. Considering the Charlotte opportunity and the additional development starts that Brad mentioned and adjusting for those properties we will complete over the remainder of 2024, we expect our development pipeline to grow to just under $1 billion, which our balance sheet is well-positioned to support. During the quarter, we invested approximately $12 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning, and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.7x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 93% fixed with an average maturity of 7.4 years at an effective rate of 3.8%. During May, we issued $400 million of seven-year public bonds at an effective rate just below 5.4%, using the proceeds to effectively pay off a $400 million bond maturity in June that had an effective rate of 4%. While our next scheduled bond maturity isn't until the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect to be in the market prior to that date to support ongoing investment opportunities. Finally, we are reaffirming the mid-point of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the second quarter, we are making slight adjustments to our guidance associated with rent growth and occupancy. We are lowering the mid-point of effective rent growth guidance by 35 basis points to 0.5% and average physical occupancy guidance by 20 basis points to 95.5% for the year. Total same-store revenue guidance for the year was revised to 0.65%, which also reflects stronger expected rent collection performance over the back half of the year. We are lowering our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 4.25% at the mid-point. As previously mentioned we have better insight into our real estate tax expense for 2024 and have lowered the mid-point of our guidance to 4%. The lower guidance is primarily due to favorable Texas property valuations as compared to our original expectations. Also, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program on July 1 and have achieved a combined premium decrease of around 1%. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results and reaffirming our original expectation for same-store NOI at negative 1.3%. In addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we were revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. As Brad previously mentioned, we also increased the mid-point of our development spend to $350 million. The impact of these adjustments, combined with the $0.03 of expected storm costs associated with Hurricane Beryl in the third quarter, resulted in us maintaining the mid-point of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share on narrowing the range of $8.74 to $9.02 per share. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Julianne, we will now turn the call back to you for questions. Hey Josh, this is Clay. Yes, I think we have pretty good visibility across the portfolio at this point with the exception of Florida. And that's the one -- that's the one state that typically lags the rest. I think keep in mind now that Florida has a cap on their valuations. And so we have a pretty good idea of where they'll ultimately end up. We just don't have the final valuation onto at this point. The other missing piece is around the millage rates. And that's fairly across the Board. But we, again, kind of same story with Florida property valuations. We have pretty good visibility as to what we think that those will be as we wrap up the rest of this year. Yes. Jamie, I'll add on to that as far as where we think that, that funding would come from, I mean, where we would look to first is to fund that through additional debt, given our leverage at the 3.7x. And so we would look to move that up at least to the 4.5x or maybe 5x. And that's a significant number. That's almost over $1 billion. So we've got plenty of opportunity there of how we would go about funding that. Especially in an environment where rates will -- we expect would continue to decline over the next year or so. Yes. Alex, just a couple of points that I would make. I mean, obviously, the revenue plays into that. And so as we kind of dial those in and adjusted for that first half performance and what it's going to look like in the back half of the year, and then achieving what we were looking forward for the back half of the year. Those will all play into that from a revenue standpoint. We feel good about all that. That feels very achievable and for all the reasons that Tim previously mentioned, we feel like that's in a good spot. And you kind of get down into the operating expense section, we talked about the real estate taxes and the insurance renewal. Those are really kind of -- those two things are really offsetting the changes that we have adjusted for and the revenue guidance. And so if you look back at kind of where we've been running and trending in personal costs, repair and maintenance costs started with the first half of the year, there is potential upside there. We've -- but we'll see how that plays out. But those two things can really talking to each other and offsetting one another, then it just gets down into below the line there. And then there's been some favorable G&A costs, interest expense, and some other items that's really offsetting that $0.03 that we noted for the hurricane during the third quarter. This is Clay. We kind of look at it next year, we think that, that property taxes, I'll start there since it's the biggest line item. But the property taxes will continue to run in this 3% to 4% range as we've adjusted our guidance is at 4% today. We think it can run probably in there for a period of time, especially given what we've seen and just for the property performance over these past couple of years given the high supply and seeing some of those income levels come down from those properties. Insurance, we saw -- we had our renewal this year, so we'll enjoy a little bit of that going into the first half of next year as well. And then it will be another negotiation at that point. And look, I wouldn't expect it to be necessarily another decrease by any stretch, but I also don't know that we would expect to see levels of what we saw in the couple of -- past couple of years of 15%, 20%. So I think it would be a much more reasonable growth with that level, assuming claims experience stays pretty effective with what they've been for us in the past. And then looking at personnel costs, repair and maintenance, marketing costs and those types of items, we think that those will continue to run at a pretty normal rate. We've seen some moderation in all those mix categories over the past year. And so we would think that those -- we would definitely would expect those to jump to a level of what they were going around 2021, 2022. So big more of the 3% to 4% growth range there."

[Operator Instructions] Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session.\n [Operator Instructions]\n This conference call is being recorded today. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. \nAndrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning with prepared comments are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo and Clay Holder. DelPriore and Joe Fracchia are also participating and available for questions as well.\n Before we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.\n During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial debt.\n Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.\n I will now turn the call over to Eric. \nH. Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and performance trends in the first quarter were in line with our expectations, and we enter the summer leasing season well positioned. Pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets.\n Our renewal pricing remained strong. Encouragingly, blended lease-over-lease pricing in the first quarter captured 100 basis points improvement as compared to the prior quarter, followed by April pricing that was ahead of the first quarter performance. While the bulk of the leasing year is still in front of us, we do like our early positioning as we head into the summer leasing season.\n We continue to believe that our high-growth markets are producing solid demand sufficient to absorb the new supply in a steady manner that will enable continued stable occupancy, strong renewal pricing, strong collections and overall revenue results that are aligned with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance.\n Our leasing traffic remains strong and record low resident turnover, favorable net migration trends and stable employment conditions across our diversified portfolio and markets continue to drive solid demand. While we expect leasing conditions will remain pressured by new supply deliveries through the year, our on-site teams actively supported by our asset management group are doing a terrific job.\n Superior Resident Services as reflected by our sector-leading Google ratings and record-high resident retention rates, along with several new technology capabilities introduced over the past couple of years are making a meaningful difference in this competitive environment. With new supply deliveries poised to begin tapering later this year, demand trends remaining stable and occupancy remaining strong, we remain optimistic that leasing conditions should recover quickly and begin improving in early 2025.\n While the transaction market remains slow, we are seeing more acquisition opportunities for new lease-up projects, which Brad will touch on in his comments, and we remain comfortable with our transaction expectation for the year.\n I continue to be optimistic about our ability to work through the current supply cycle with in our high-growth markets ability to absorb new supply. With a 30-year performance record focused on these high-growth markets, we've operated through prior supply cycles.\n Today, we believe our diversified and higher-quality portfolio, our stronger operating platform our stronger balance sheet have us positioned to compete at an even higher level. We're excited about the outlook over the next few years.\n Our high-growth markets continue to offer attractive long-term appeal for employers, households and real estate investors. We have a meaningful future growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries decline and leasing conditions strengthen. Several new technology initiatives will drive further efficiencies and higher operating margins from our existing portfolio and a pipeline of redevelopment opportunities will also drive higher rent growth from our existing properties.\n And finally, our external growth pipeline continues to expand, setting the stage for a meaningful additional NOI growth. I'd like to send my appreciation to our MAA team for a solid start to 2024.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. \nBrad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. In preparation for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in 2025 through at least 2028, we continue to make progress in putting our balance sheet capacity to work to deliver future earnings growth.\n Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on a 302-unit prepurchase development in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we expect to start construction this quarter on a 345-unit project under our prepurchase development platform in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA.\n Both projects are expected to deliver first units by mid-2026, and deliver stabilized NOI yields in the mid-6% range consistent with what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing.\n With the addition of these two projects, our active development pipeline represents 2,617 units at a total cost of approximately $866 million. With continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains low. But we have seen cap rates firm up a bit from fourth quarter with market cap rates on deals we track that closed in the first quarter, averaging approximately 5.1%, 30 basis points lower than the previous quarter.\n Despite the low transaction volume, our team continues to find compelling select acquisition opportunities. We currently have an off-market 306-unit suburban property in Raleigh under contract to acquire for approximately $81 million that we expect to close this month. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease up at 49% occupancy and is expected to stabilize in mid- to late 2025.\n At this point, we believe our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. Despite the increased pressure from new supply, our 4 developments that are actively leasing 3 of which are under construction and 1 that has completed and is in lease-up continue to deliver good performance.\n While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment with concessions on select units, up from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, we continue to achieve rents on average approximately 18% above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOI and earnings and creating additional long-term shareholder value.\n For these 4 projects, we expect to achieve an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%, exceeding our original expectations by 70 basis points. We continue to make progress on the predevelopment work for a number of projects. In addition to the two 2nd quarter development starts I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year.\n While we have not seen a broad reduction in construction costs, encouragingly, we have achieved some level of reduction on our recent pricing supporting our ability to start construction on these projects. We have seen better subcontractor bid participation, which we expect to lead to better execution with stronger subs throughout the construction process for our new starts.\n We are hopeful that the significant drop in construction starts that we've seen in our region will lead to more substantial construction cost declines. As we progress through the year, allowing us to start construction on additional opportunities in our development pipeline, which today consists of 10 well-located sites that we either own or control, representing additional growth of nearly 2,800 units.\n We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined in our execution timing. Any project we start this year will deliver first units in 2026 and 2027 aligning with what is likely to be a strong leasing environment, supported by significantly lower supply.\n Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this liquidity-constrained environment, it's possible we could add additional in-house and prepurchase development opportunities to our current and future pipeline.\n While we continue to pursue numerous external growth opportunities, our existing portfolio remains in a good position heading into the busier leasing season. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets currently outperforming.\n As Tim will outline further, despite the high level of new supply, we continue to see solid demand and absorption, leading to improved current occupancy with future exposure better than this time last year.\n Our collections are strong and near pre-COVID levels at 99.6% of billed rents. Our resident base is stable with more residents choosing to live with us longer, supported by our focus on customer service, coupled with high single-family housing costs.\n Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for all you do to improve our business and serve our residents and those around you while exceeding expectations of those that depend on us.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim. \nTim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Eric mentioned, new lease pricing in the first quarter continued to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries in several of our markets. This, combined with typically slower traffic patterns that are evident this time of the year attributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of negative 6.2%.\n Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong, growing 5%. Because traffic tends to be relatively low as compared to the second and third quarters, we intentionally repriced less than 20% of our leases in the first quarter. The new lease to renewal pricing resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of negative 0.6% for the quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter.\n Average physical occupancy was 95.3%, and collections outperformed expectations with net delinquency representing less than 0.4% of build rents. All these factors drove the resulting revenue growth of 1.4%. From a market perspective, in the first quarter, larger markets such as the Washington, D.C. metro area and Houston continue to hold up well and Nashville showed improvement.\n Many of our mid-tier metros also continue to be steady with Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville, all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint.\n Our diversification between larger and mid-tier markets helps balance performance through the cycle. The improving performance of a market like Nashville, which is getting a lot of new supply, demonstrates the benefit of submarket diversification along with the market diversification. Austin and Jacksonville are two markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets.\n Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives. For the first quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,100 interior unit upgrades. Given the number of units and lease up across our portfolio currently, we expect to renovate fewer units in 2024 than we would in a typical year, but would expect to reaccelerate the program in 2025.\n We have now completed over 94,000 smart home upgrades since the inception of the program, and we expect to complete the remaining few properties this year. For our repositioning program, we have 4 active projects that are in the repricing phase, and we have targeted an additional 6 projects to begin later in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025.\n Regarding April metrics, we are encouraged by the accelerating trends from both the first quarter and March in both pricing and occupancy. April blended pricing is negative 0.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the first quarter and a 70 basis point improvement from March. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter and notably a 70 basis point improvement from March. And renewal pricing of 5.1%, slightly ahead of the first quarter and an improvement of 50 basis points from March.\n Average physical occupancy for April was 95.5%, also up from both the first quarter and March. And as Brad noted, 60-day exposure also remained lower than this time last year at 8.5% versus the prior year of 8.8%. As we've discussed, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, but we still believe the outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter.\n While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, with demand and leasing traffic expected to increase in the spring and summer, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in early to mid-2022. And we've seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about 2 years after construction store.\n While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the first quarter in our markets was the highest for any first quarter in the last 2 decades and the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Job growth is still expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but has recently been revised upwards and growth still expected to be strongest in the Sun Belt region in the country.\n Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerate the key demand factor of household formation. Additionally, we saw a resident turnover continued to decline in the first quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. In fact, the 12.9% of move-outs in the first quarter that were due to a resident buying a home with the lowest ever for MAA.\n That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Clay. \nClay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About half of the favorability was related to the timing of real estate taxes, while the remaining outperformance is related to the collective timing of overhead cost, interest expense and nonoperating income.\n Our same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong rent collections. Excluding the favorable timing of real estate tax expenses, same-store operating expenses were slightly higher than our first quarter guidance, primarily due to onetime property costs.\n During the quarter, we funded approximately $44 million of development cost of the current expected $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $202 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. Although we expect to complete three projects in the second half of 2024 with the additional starts that Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to grow our development pipeline over the remainder of the year, which our balance sheet is well positioned to support.\n During the quarter, we invested a total of $9.4 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio.\n Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments.\n Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.6x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed with an average maturity of 7.2 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. During January, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.\n We have an upcoming $400 million maturity in June that has an effective rate of 4%. Following this maturity, the next scheduled bond maturity is in the fourth quarter of 2025. Finally, with the bulk of leasing season ahead of us, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our core FFO guidance for the year while slightly tightening the full year range to $8.70 to $9.06 per share. We are also maintaining our same store as well as other key guidance ranges for the year.\n That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions. \nOperator: We will now open the call up for questions.\n [Operator Instructions]\n Our first question will come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Just want to hit a little bit on the operating side of the business. And I was hoping you could provide some detail on sort of the operating playbook in the next couple of months and how you're thinking about pushing on lease rate growth and occupancy. And has the breakdown between new and renewal lease rate growth that you embedded in guidance changed at all at this point? \nTim Argo: Austin this is Tim. Yes, I'll give you a little bit of an overview. I mean I think we're -- as I mentioned in my comments, with where we are in exposure, where we are with occupancy we feel like we're in a good place there. So we'll continue as we get into that, certainly, busier part of the season now, the push on new lease rent growth where we can and balance a little bit depending on property by property.\n It's not necessarily a portfolio-wide decision. We look at everything based on occupancy and exposure by property, but we're comfortable with where occupancy is. We'll continue to push on pricing where we can. As far as the mix between new lease renewal, first quarter was about where we expected it to be with renewals, probably 51% to 49% in terms of the total leases that we did in Q1. I would expect it to blend a little more towards renewals over the next couple of quarters.\n So that's a key thing to keep in mind as you think about pricing trajectory for the rest of the year is that we do expect turnover to remain low, and that the renewals have a little bit heavier weight than the new leases. \nAustin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then the March data implies there was a pocket of softness, which I think you alluded to a little bit in your prepared remarks, comparing the March versus April. I mean anything from a comp issue or a 60-day exposure perspective that caused you to pull back in March to just position the portfolio better heading into April and May? Just looking for some additional detail there. \nTim Argo: Yes. I mean there was a little bit more of a push towards occupancy, I would say, in late February and early March is based again looking at it on a targeted basis where exposure was. And that's late February or early March time frame is always the time of the year where you start to see lease expirations pick up and you're kind of waiting on that demand to pick up as it as it has and it starts to do in March.\n So there was a little bit of a lean towards occupancy during that period. And as you saw, as we got into April, we saw acceleration both in pricing and in occupancy from where we're in March. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. \nBrad Heffern: Just sticking with the leasing spreads. Typically, you see a decent sized uptick in April. Obviously, I know March was weak and so there was an uptick, but it seems like it's not tremendously different than what you saw in January and February. So I guess has traffic picked up a lot in April? And are you surprised that the leasing spreads didn't increase more sequentially? \nTim Argo: To the first question, yes, we have seen traffic pick up leads, lead volume, and we look at it kind of going back to the exposure factor. We look at leads for exposed unit, and that's as good as what it was. We've kind of talked about we haven't seen a normal year since probably 2018, 2019. So we're sort of exceeding those levels when you think about traffic volume and leads for exposed and all the things that we look at internally for demand.\n I mean, with the March new lease pricing, I mean, it's -- when you get into individual months, it can be volatility, and there's not a ton of leases getting done in the first quarter. So it's going to ebb and flow from month-to-month. What we're looking to see is kind of quarter-to-quarter, see that general trajectory moving up, and we're seeing that and it will play out over the next 3 or 4 months.\n I mean we will reprice about 50% of our leases for the year between May, June, July and August. Obviously, that will be  the biggest part of the impact of what it has on the year, and that's also when we start to see the traffic really pick up. So that's where it will really play out as over these next 3 or 4 months. \nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, you said a stronger leasing environment through at least 2028 when the supply drops off, I think a lot of people would agree on 2026. But I'm curious why you would project strength that far out is the expectation that a low level of starts is just maintained indefinitely and that's what's driving it? Or if you could give your thinking there? \nBrad Hill: Brad, this is Brad. Yes, I think relative to that comment, it's a realization that the high level of supply that we are seeing today is partly a result of cheap financing that's been available over the last couple of years and just realizing that in general, those times are behind us. And so getting back to a more normal supply environment going forward into the future.\n I do think over the next couple of years, the supply environment will be below long-term averages, but perhaps we get back closer to long-term averages as we get out a few years. But then when you layer on top of that, just the demand strength that we are seeing in our region of the country leads us to believe that the fundamentals could be very, very good for a number of years. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. \nStephen Chen: This is Stephen Chen on for Josh. Just a quick question on the concession usage. Wondering whether you can kind of comment on that, like across your markets. Where you see the biggest concession and where you see maybe the improvements? \nTim Argo: Yes. This is Tim. I mean at a high level, concession usage is pretty similar to what we saw in Q4. We haven't seen it get materially worse or better. For us as a portfolio was about 0.5% of rents last quarter. It's about 0.4% of rents this quarter. At a market level, it obviously varies a little bit. I would say, again, not a lot of movement from last quarter.\n One market where we've seen it probably get a little bit heavier concession usage is in Charlotte, where we're seeing 1.5 to 2 months there. Austin continues to be, obviously, a heavy concession market, but no worse than really than what we were seeing before, where you've got 1 to 5 months and most of the submarkets in Austin with probably closer to 2, if you think about Central Austin.\n And then the other one we're keeping an eye on, I would say, is Atlanta, we're certainly in the Midtown area, we've seen concession uses pick up a little bit. But broadly, as I said, kind of stable and not seeing quite the usage from developers that we saw late last year. \nStephen Chen: And then on a different subject on the development yield, sorry if I missed that, but can you comment on like what's the yield you're underwriting for the new starts? And maybe also some comments on the construction costs you're seeing right now? \nBrad Hill: This is Brad. Yes, I would comment that the yields that we're expecting on our new starts for this year are in the mid-6% range, which is consistent with what we're delivering today on our existing development portfolio. So that is a pretty good spread from where current cap rates are, call it, low 5s as I mentioned in my comments. So we're still in that call it, 150 basis points spread or so range with current cap rates, which feels really good to us.\n And in terms of construction costs, I mentioned in my comments, we haven't seen a broad reduction in construction costs. It's really market specific. There are some markets where the supply pipeline is really dropped faster and quicker and earlier than other markets, we're seeing some cost reduction in those markets.\n There are others, for example, the two projects that we are starting, we have seen our partners have been able to get construction cost reductions without scope reductions in those projects, which I think is a positive for both of those, but we're not seeing across the board construction cost reduction in our markets in general. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: It seems like the quarter was generally in line with expectations just above the midpoint, yet demand was unseasonably strong. So does that mean that demand needs to stay at unseasonably strong levels to kind of hit the high point of the guidance going forward? \nTim Argo: I mean I don't think it needs to necessarily stay at higher levels than what we expected. I think it needs to be at levels that we've seen pretty consistently now for a while. I mean the demand has been there in our markets for a while. Job growth in migration continues. The number of move-outs that we're seeing outside of our -- to outside of our footprint has declined. So that net in migration is pretty consistent with where it's been.\n So it's really just continuing to see the demand at a steady level. And then now as we get into a heavier traffic period, we would expect that to obviously benefit, which is what you didn't see in Q4, Q1 is obviously the lower traffic patterns. But demand is there, and now we're getting into the heavier traffic season and heavier lease expirations, which will have a greater benefit.\n So I think mainly just seeing that demand at a high level, it would take some sort of economic shock, I think, to move it to where it's something that is not attainable in terms of thinking about our guidance. \nMichael Goldsmith: And my follow-up is, what is your expectations of leasing spreads during the peak leasing season? And how much momentum can be picked up on the new lease side? And along with that, can you hold renewals at 5% when new leases are down 6%? Does that lead to increased negotiation on renewals? \nTim Argo: Yes. I mean we're -- this time of the year, there's always a fairly wide spread when you're looking at new leases first renewals. It's gapped out a little bit from where it typically is, but not hugely different, and I expect those spreads to narrow a little bit as we get into the spring and summer.\n Our expectation for renewals, and I think we've talked about a little bit last quarter, it's kind of in that 4.5% to 5% range. We've been closer to 5% right now. We think somewhere in that 4.5%, 4.75% range is reasonable for the rest of the year. And keeping in mind, too, when you think about the lower turnover, those renewals are going to have an outsized impact on the blended leasing spreads more so the new lease pricing.\n And our expectation for new lease pricing, while it is for it to accelerate from here over the next few months and then moderate back down as we get into Q4, still, but it's going to be negative for the full year. We don't expect to see new lease pricing get to 0 or get positive. I think it's probably well into the spring season, spring and summer 2025 before we see that. But that's a high level how we're thinking about it. \nH. Bolton: And Michael, this is Eric. Just to add on to what Tim is saying. I think another thing to keep in mind is when you look at that negative 6% on new lease pricing versus 5% of renewal in terms of a lease-over-lease comparison, that implies, I think, in some people's mind a bigger dollar difference than what's at play really. \n If you look at the actual rent amount that we're achieving on new leases and the actual rent amount that we're achieving on renewals is only -- the spread is only about $150, and that, of course, as Tim mentioned, is kind of the biggest spread we see from a seasonal perspective. And then it tends to narrow a bit over the course of the spring and the summer.\n So the friction cost of moving and some of the other issues you run into moving suggest to us that spread is -- and again, recognizing it's going -- we think, narrow a bit over the spring and summer. We think yields an opportunity for us to continue to achieve the renewal pricing performance along the lines of what we've outlined, and we don't see any particular concerns about the spread in terms of what you're referring to. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. \nEric Wolfe: Maybe just a follow-up on Michael's question there a second ago. Based on your guidance, it looks like you need around 1.7%, 1.8% sort of blended growth that to hit your blended spread guidance for the year. I mean, is that the right way to think about it? And I guess when do you think we'll hit that level? \nTim Argo: When you say, are you talking about blended spreads or new lease, you talking about blended? \nEric Wolfe: Blended spread. I mean blended spread, I mean, I think your guidance before is 1%. So if you're based on what you've done thus far, we were calculating like 1.7%, 1.8% for the rest of the year? And then I guess, on the new lease side, right, if you assume 5% renewal for the rest of the year, you probably need like negative 2% on new lease. But I was just trying to understand sort of what's embedded for the rest of the year and when you think we'll see those levels. \nTim Argo: Yes. I mean I don't think it's quite to the level you said on new leases. I mean, a couple of things to keep in mind that we sort of alluded to is one, the Q2 and Q3 will represent about 60%, 65% of all the leases. So -- which is also the strongest period. So that will weigh heavier into the full year blended. And then along with that, we tend to see the renewal portion of that mix tick up even more in Q2 and Q3 as well.\n So you have to -- when you're thinking about a dialed in a heavier weighting on the renewals and dialed in a heavier weighting on the lease spread throughout the year. So yes, I mean, I think we talked about kind of 4.5% to 5% in the renewal range and new leases staying negative, but certainly accelerating from where they are now.\n And then as you get into kind of September and beyond, would expect it to drop back down, not quite to the level we saw in Q4 of last year, but certainly a little bit further negative. But I think the main thing to keep in mind is just the weighting both in terms of leases per quarter and then the weighting between new leases renewals. \nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then there was a comment in the release and you alluded to it in your remarks about a quick turnaround in rental performance later this year, next year. Sort of what markets do you think we'll see that turnaround the fastest. So based on your supply projections, where do you think we'll see that quicker turnaround? \nTim Argo: Yes. I would say that at a high level, the markets that have been strong, continue to be strong, and I would expect to remain strong. And then I'm thinking about D.C. and Houston and then some of the mid-tier markets like Charleston and Richmond and Savannah and Greenville to some extent.\n The ones I would keep an eye on that I think can start really helping some of the Florida markets, both Orlando and Tampa are starting to show some improvement, and we're, I think, a little bit further along in that supply absorption, if you will, than some other markets.\n So those are a couple. And then I remarked about Nashville in the prepared comments as well. That's another one that I think continue to see some benefit from. It's getting a lot of supply and working through it, but where we are in that market is pretty well positioned. So I would say those three beyond the ones that have been pretty steady for us right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nDaniel Tricarico: It's Daniel Tricarico for Nick. Maybe for Brad, can you expand on the confidence in the acquisition opportunity that you highlighted in your prepared remarks? And also, what is the initial and stabilized yield on the Raleigh lease-up deal? \nBrad Hill: Yes. So the Raleigh lease-up deal is a 6% NOI yield is what we're expecting out of that. And I'm sorry, I missed the very first part of your question. \nDaniel Tricarico: Just a general commentary you had in the prepared remarks on the confidence in the acquisition opportunity set. \nBrad Hill: Yes. I mean I think if you look at where we sit today, as we've said over the last few quarters, the transaction market has been quiet for a couple of years, but the supply is up. So we just feel like the need to transact continues to build while we're not seeing transactions I think the difficulty has been the volatility on interest rates has really slowed the market down from transactions occurring.\n But I'll tell you, just looking at our underwriting deals that we've reviewed, the volume is up. There's more coming out. There's more in the market right now. I think we -- first quarter, what we underwrote was double what it was in fourth quarter. It's still not to where it was a couple of years ago. So we do believe that, that volume just continues to grow from where we sit today. And I would say the other thing that gives us confidence really is just our history in the Sun Belt.\n Eric mentioned we've been focused exclusively on this region for 30 years, and we have a reputation of performance in our region of the country, whether it's on the operating side or transaction side. So we get a lot of looks and opportunities that perhaps others do not get. The Raleigh opportunity specifically was an off-market opportunity that we got, and I think we'll have other opportunities like that.\n Our relationships are pretty strong and deep in this region of the country, especially with the merchant developers who are the largest builders in this region. If you look at what we purchased over the last 10 years, almost $2 billion, over 80% of that was from merchant developers. So we have a very good relationship with all of those folks. And we think that will lead to additional opportunities as we go through the year. \nDaniel Tricarico: And then just going back to the revenue outlook, the job growth numbers you talked about an initial guidance obviously seem pretty conservative now 4 months into the year, but no change to the revenue components in guidance. How should we be interpreting that? \nTim Argo: I think really just interpreting to the fact that we have the heavier leasing season ahead of us. Like I said, the first quarter leasing is about 19% of our leases. So we'll do 50% over the next 4 months. That's really when driving -- it's just seeing how it plays out over the next few months, but certainly encourage where the demand side is. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. \nHaendel St. Juste: So I'm encouraged to hear that your development pipeline is leasing up better than expected and concessions are stabilizing. But my question is, one, I guess, more so on the private market. Are you tracking how the private market to supply is getting leased up their absorption? I'm thinking back to last summer when the private guys blink and they dropped pricing late in the summer to achieve some target goals and end up obviously impacting demand and pricing on your end.\n So I guess I'm curious if you're seeing anything on the data or behavior that can give you any insight into how their progress is coming along or if we could be facing the same risk later this summer? \nBrad Hill: This is Brad, and I'll start, Tim can add to it. We do have a little bit of insight in that just via a couple of avenues. One, the comp properties all of our properties. We monitor specifically how our comps are performing. And then also, as I mentioned earlier, we just have relationships with all the developers in the market.\n And I would say just in general, from the information that we have, we're seeing a more measured approach to concession usage this time this year than we did in the third, fourth quarter of last year. And we're not seeing as much pressure from the developers at this point in terms of pushing to get ahead of the supply wave. We're in the supply wave now.\n So now they're starting to look at potentially monetizing and transacting their properties and leaning too heavily into concessions at this point is going to severely impact their valuation. So they're being a bit more measured at this time of the year than they were last year from what we can see at this point. \nTim Argo: Yes. And I'll add to that. I mean, we do track properties in our markets that are in lease-up and how quickly they're leasing up and that sort of thing. And right now that would suggest any concerns from that point. I mean, certainly, as we get later in this year and you get to the fourth quarter, things can change quickly based on what they're doing, but we're not seeing it right now, but that is part of why we certainly dial in, particularly on the new lease side that we think it will moderate back down as you get into the fourth quarter.\n And even though we think supply will be less than it is today, it probably doesn't manifest itself in terms of seeing that in the numbers probably until you get into 2025. \nHaendel St. Juste: And can you remind us, you mentioned the number of good markets that are hitting peak supply this quarter. Which markets are still left to hit peak supply amongst your larger markets? \nTim Argo: Yes. I mean it's pretty consistent, to be honest, where again, we kind of look back to when construction starts and do a lot of looks at different markets of how long it takes to that peak pressure to hit. But -- and most of them are in sort of that Q2 time frame. I would say Atlanta is probably one, that's maybe a little bit behind that curve. Charlotte is one that's probably a little bit behind that curve. And then I would think of a market like Phoenix and we're landing in Tampa probably a little bit ahead of that curve. But at a high level, most are within that range and certainly within a quarter, give or take, of that same range. \nHaendel St. Juste: My second question is just -- I'm sorry if you provided this, but what's the indicative pricing today for your June debt maturity? Curious what kind of rates you're seeing in the market right now, what we should assume? \nClay Holder: Haendel, this is Clay. Right now, we're seeing anywhere between 5.6% and 5.7% as we look to that maturity. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. \nAdam Kramer: Just wondering where you've gone out for May, June and maybe even July at this point for your renewals? \nTim Argo: Yes, for the next couple of months, and we're just wrapping up July now, but for the next couple of months, we're in the 4.6%, 4.7%, 4.8% range. \nAdam Kramer: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the development starts, Look, I really appreciate the disclosure and color on kind of the couple of starts that you had in the last quarter and beginning of second quarter. And look, I think given where your balance sheet is and given I think what you've described as a really compelling opportunity to deliver into much less supply in '26, '27, '28, what would prevent you or what would encourage you kind of drive you to do more developments today, again, given where the balance sheet is, I would think you have the capacity to start a bunch more?\n So maybe just walk us kind of the puts and the takes? And maybe just at a higher conceptual level, the thought process around whether to do more development, start more now to deliver into that kind of undersupply period in '26, '27 and '28. \nBrad Hill: Adam, this is Brad. Certainly, we have been building development as a capability and a tool for us to lean into over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have a pipeline of projects that we could start and really deliver value over the next couple of years. Really what's preventing us from doing that more broadly, has just been hitting the returns that we need on our developments.\n As I mentioned, the two that we're starting in the second quarter we're able to get some construction cost reductions out of those to get the yields to where we think, call it that 100 to 150 basis point spread to cap rates puts us in that 6% to 6.5% range. And the two that we're starting are in that 6.5% range.\n So we feel really good about those developments where they're located. The markets, the ability to layer our platform onto those when they deliver and drive additional efficiencies long term. But we expect, as I mentioned, we've started -- we'll start two here in the second quarter, another one to two by the end of this year. And then we have another three that we have approvals in place and ready to go, if we're able to get construction costs down far enough to make the numbers work at those hurdles that I mentioned.\n But aside from those, again, we are continuing to evaluate the land market. We're continuing to evaluate our prepurchase opportunities. There could be opportunities that emerge in that area where a merchant developer that we have a relationship with perhaps has an equity partner that backs out or can't raise debt or something along those lines that provides us another opportunity to lean into that area.\n So development is an area that we continue to focus on and believe strongly in terms of creating long-term value through that avenue. So to the extent that we continue to get the returns that make sense, we'll continue to execute in that area. \nH. Bolton: Adam, this is Eric. Just to add on to what Brad is saying. We spend a lot of time thinking about just how much development risk that we want to put on the platform. And one of the things that we centered around is the idea that we'd like to keep our exposure in forward funding obligations, if you will, no more than around sort of 5% of enterprise values, which based on sort of where pricing is today for us, that would put it at around $1 billion.\n Also recognizing that we've got a lot more of our development increasingly has been through this repurchase program where we are effectively partnering with merchant developers that we know quite well throughout the region, and it enables us to share in some of the risk and some of the downside issues that you could sometimes run into with development.\n So taking our pipeline up a bit from where it is today, not something we would hesitate to do given both the approach that we're taking and just the capacity we have on the balance sheet and in terms of overall enterprise value. So we feel pretty good about pushing on this agenda as much as the numbers will support in terms of what Brad was discussing. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: I believe Adrian mentioned in his prepared remarks that acquisition cap rates have compressed to 5.1% despite the raise in interest rates. So I guess my question is, is it your view that the appetite for negative leverage has come back? Or were these transactions one-off with below market debt? \nBrad Hill: John, this is Brad. I don't think that these cap rates are representative of below-market debt. I mean I don't think there's many loan assumptions that are in these numbers that I'm quoting. And some of these are reflective of very recent transactions as of a few days ago, where we've gotten the cap rate information.\n So these are very current numbers in terms of yields. I mean, honestly, the spread of cap rates is wider than what it has been in the past. I mean the spread that we're seeing right now is from 4.5% to, call it, 5.5% and really, again, averaging in that low 5% range.\n So in terms of where debt is today, it's in the -- debt rates are in the high 5% range, almost 6%. So my assumption would be that these underwritings either are assuming a run-up in fundamentals or refinance in a couple of years where they're able to take the interest rate back down. \nJohn Kim: And are you willing to transact at these levels because this is the market now? \nBrad Hill: Well, we're not. If you look at the Raleigh acquisition, for example, that's representative and the two acquisitions that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. That's representative of where we're willing to transact, which from a yield perspective, has been in the high 5s and then the Raleigh transaction was a 6% yield.\n That's where we are comfortable transacting. And we believe, again, based on our ability our balance sheet strength, ability to close all cash and things of that nature, focusing on properties that are in lease-up that are hard to finance that selectively, we'll be able to find some opportunities to help us hit our $400 million forecast. But at a broad market level of a 5% or so cap rate, at this point, we're not active in that in that price range. \nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question, if I could squeeze one in, is on your turnover at a record low level, which is surprising given market dynamics I realize a lot of residents are not moving out to buy a home. But is there anything else about the residents today that are different than maybe a few years ago, whether it's the less mobile now or the cost of moving has gone up just more reluctant to move or maybe they're more aware of the concession came and land was used?. \nTim Argo: This is Tim, John. I don't think there's anything especially different in the resident. We look at all the sort of the resident demographics are pretty consistent with what they've been the last couple of years. But certainly, it's much more difficult to buy a house. And if you look at our markets in particular, given where interest rates are now, it's about 70% more expensive household than it is our average rent.\n So that's a very significant difference and then you consider cost moving and all that. And so that plays into it. And the other reason that's down is certainly move out to a rent increase or down pretty significantly than what we've seen in the last couple of years as well.\n So I think those two things are driving it and primarily just the cost of buying, which is -- that's always historically along with job transfer by houses that are our highest reason for move out. So I think that's driving it down, combined with the move-out increase. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJames Feldman: I guess just shifting gear to the expense side. Can you talk more about the kind of outsized expenses in the first quarter? And just as you're thinking about your guidance for the rest of the year, has anything changed? Are there any areas where you're more or less confident on being able to hit the decline item in your numbers or just things you may want to point out that we should be paying attention to? \nClay Holder: Sure, Jamie. This is Clay. Just speaking to the first quarter and what we saw there. The biggest -- the slight unfavorable we had there that we called out in the comments, was really around some onetime property costs around some storm damages that we had at a number of properties, nothing significant, but it was a bit of -- a bit outside of what we were dialing in for the quarter.\n As we think about going forward through the rest of the year, I mean, we're still early on. And when you look to what our larger expense line items are specifically real estate expenses, we still need some more information there before we can really peg that number, but we still feel very confident about our guidance that we set forth on real estate tax expenses at about 4.75% growth year-over-year.\n Also, insurance expenses will, although a much smaller component of our operating expense stack, still some more information to come on it as well. When you think about personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and the other line items that are touching there, we feel confident about those, and those trended in line with what we were expecting for first quarter, and we expect those to continue in that same manner over the remainder of the year. \nJames Feldman: Okay. I mean, so it sounds like you kind of baked in some risk there on all of those, if you're not quite sure what the outcome looks like, but you're pretty comfortable... \nTim Argo: I'd say that's fair. I mean, again, real estate taxes will get the majority of the valuation around that. In late second quarter, early third quarter, we'll probably have a little bit more to say about that in the second quarter call. Same for insurance expense as well. And again, the other expenses pretty much in line with what we've dialed in. \nJames Feldman: Okay. Great. And then I guess just thinking about where we are in the cycle and the opportunities you're seeing if you think about where you may be buying, I mean, you've got your more supply-challenged markets or some of the larger MSAs then your footprint, you've also got access -- you've also got exposure in markets like Kansas City, Birmingham, Fredericksburg. Do you think the opportunities this cycle are going to show up in those types of markets more? And when we look back in 5 years and think about the portfolio footprint, maybe that's where you guys grow more? Or no, you want to stick with the larger population, faster job growth market as you build out the portfolio and put your capital to work? \nBrad Hill: Jamie, this is Brad. I think as we look at where we want to deploy capital, broadly speaking, the high-growth regions of where we're located is what we're targeting. And that's going to be both our larger markets as well as some of our mid-tier markets that you mentioned. I mean in Tim's prepared comments, he noted some of the mid-tier markets that are performing quite well right now.\n Our larger markets. We are committed to those. I think when we combine both of those components as part of our story, it's part of the diversification that we're looking for, for our earnings stream, and I think they perform well together.\n So I would say you would see us focus on both components there in terms of growing. I would also just say that as we focus on buying new properties generally that are in lease-up, where the average age over the last 10 years that we purchased has been 1 year.\n So these are brand-new properties generally, those are going to follow a little bit of where the supply is. That's where the opportunities are going to be that we're going to find. But broadly speaking, both segments of our portfolio will be areas that we focus on. \nJames Feldman: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. Like when you're underwriting acquisitions, what is your rent growth outlook? What are you guys modeling in '24, '25, '26, the time for the deal? \nBrad Hill: Yes, it's going to be different based on each market. But I would say, in general, '24 is going to be flattish. But you also have to remember that on our deals that we're underwriting on an acquisition, the leases are predominantly new leases, which is different than our existing portfolio, but we're generally bringing all new leases into the portfolio.\n So it's going to be flattish year 1, 2025 is going to have a positive uptick and '26 and '27 are going to be higher than long-term averages on average. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldvarg with Piper Sandler. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Two questions. The first is jobs have definitely been stronger than everyone collectively as imagined. And my question is, were you guys just overly conservative in job expectations? Or have the jobs truly been like much better than anyone would have expected? Just trying to understand the difference, what's going on because clearly, it's allowing you guys and others to handle the supply much better than was originally believed to be the case. \nH. Bolton: Well, we use a number of different sources to compile our view of what the demand horizon and the job growth is going to be. Obviously, a year or so ago, there was more nervousness surrounding the prospects of a more material slowdown in the economy. We have seen some moderation in '24 as compared to certainly '23 and '22, but broadly speaking, we've long believed that these Sun Belt markets had underpinnings associated with them surrounding employer stability and job growth and new jobs coming such that we felt pretty good about the job growth or about the employment markets broadly holding up.\n What has probably been, frankly, more surprising for us is just what's happening in terms of our resident behavior who slightly move-outs to buying a home. The real decline in people leaving to go buy a home and resulting impact that has on demand has probably been the more surprising factor in our thinking about demand projections.\n We weren't really that surprised by the employment market and the migration trends have continued to hold up very similar to what we've experienced for the last few years. So I would say the home buying scenario has probably been the biggest surprise variable for us. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is transaction market really tough. But in fairness, it's -- I mean, the transaction market almost, I guess, you'd have to go back to the RTC days for it to be sort of lucrative. And over the past decade or so since the credit crisis, we've never seen assets dumped onto the market.\n So was there a thinking that -- what is your sense? Is it the bank regulators are just getting a lot more lenient with the banks? On the banks for them dealing with developers and saying, look, if the guy is sort of doing a good effort, don't force a foreclosure, don't force a sale or what do you think has changed? Because it sounds like it's more on the lending side that the owners or developers aren't being pushed to transact in assets that maybe 15, 20 years ago, they would have been.\n So would you attribute that more to the regulators or to something else out there that's not forcing the deals that you would have otherwise expected to happen? \nBrad Hill: Yes. This is Brad. I think there's really two components of that. I would say, number one, we have seen a number of loans, specifically in 2023. The last number I saw was 85% of the loans that were coming due, we're pushed. We're extended in 2023.\n So I do think there is a component of that, that has occurred. I think relative to developers, specifically, I think for them, over the last couple of years, there's been a change in how they have approached their construction lending, in the term that they're able to get in their construction loans now is longer than what I have ever seen it before, where they're able to get 4 to 5 years in their term of their construction loans.\n And a lot of times, they have the ability built in if they're hitting certain coverage ratios, they're able to extend that 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. there are certain components built into those loans that I think are allowing developers to be a little bit more runway before they're forced to sell on new construction loans. So I think those two components are really addressing that. \nH. Bolton: And Alex, this is Eric. I'll add on to what Brad is saying. A couple of other things that I think I would point to as well, when you try to contrast and compare the buying environment, the buying opportunity that we thought was going to be forthcoming, contrast that to historical cycles in the past, like coming out of the great financial recession in 2008, 2009, that 2-year period following that fall off. We bought 9,000 apartments in 2 years.\n But a lot of that was a function of, if you will, a real recession, real demand fell off considerably. And anytime you have an environment where the demand is really negatively impacted that can really create some distress. And we just haven't seen that play out this time. Demand has remained very strong.\n And I think that has confidence among a lot of merchant builders and banks to have the ability to sort of hang in there because the demand has been so strong. And then secondly, the thing that's at play here as compared to past cycles where buying opportunities were more plentiful is that there is so much capital on the sidelines now ready to pounce and people know that.\n And so I think just the backdrop of strong demand a lot of investor capital ready to jump into multifamily, particularly in the Sun Belt has enabled the markets in pricing to hold up better than what I think some people thought was likely to happen. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. \nLinda Yu Tsai: Just wondering if you're doing anything differently on the marketing side to drive traffic in the higher supply markets? \nTim Argo: This is Tim. I mean, probably not necessarily anything differently on a market-by-market basis, but we've actually updated our website back toward the end of February, which is intended to drive more traffic organically and through to our site as opposed to using some IOSs, which can be quite a bit more expensive. We're getting more involved in some social media things and that type of thing. But it's really just trying to drive people and traffic towards our website and really be able to experience what's there and have a better feel for the community in the neighborhood, and we have everything you want to look at there with floor plans and unit types and all that sort of thing.\n So it's really just continuing to expand how we think about that and how we use technology there as well as getting a little more involved in some of the social media channels. \nLinda Yu Tsai: And then along those lines, any automation or efficiency initiatives? Any updates to highlight there? \nTim Argo: Yes. I mean there's the one highlight that we talked about is something that we think will not only drive down marketing costs but increased demand and the traffic coming in that way. There's a smart home initiative that we've been talking about that we're wrapping up this year. I mean I think over the next 2, 3, 4 years, the biggest initiative in terms of what it can do for margin is continuing sort of our ubiquitous or full property WiFi.\n We have half of our property on a bulk Internet program now. We've been doing that for 3 or 4 years, but there's opportunities for the other half with this even enhanced version of higher margin. I think there's a $30 million more opportunity there. Just on the part of the portfolio that's not on bulk. And then I think as we renegotiate some of those existing contracts, there's huge opportunities there as we look over the next several years. \nOperator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks. \nH. Bolton: We appreciate everyone joining us this morning, and feel free to reach out for other questions and see most of you at NAREIT I'm sure. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and performance trends in the first quarter were in line with our expectations, and we enter the summer leasing season well positioned. Pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets.\n Our renewal pricing remained strong. Encouragingly, blended lease-over-lease pricing in the first quarter captured 100 basis points improvement as compared to the prior quarter, followed by April pricing that was ahead of the first quarter performance. While the bulk of the leasing year is still in front of us, we do like our early positioning as we head into the summer leasing season.\n We continue to believe that our high-growth markets are producing solid demand sufficient to absorb the new supply in a steady manner that will enable continued stable occupancy, strong renewal pricing, strong collections and overall revenue results that are aligned with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance.\n Our leasing traffic remains strong and record low resident turnover, favorable net migration trends and stable employment conditions across our diversified portfolio and markets continue to drive solid demand. While we expect leasing conditions will remain pressured by new supply deliveries through the year, our on-site teams actively supported by our asset management group are doing a terrific job.\n Superior Resident Services as reflected by our sector-leading Google ratings and record-high resident retention rates, along with several new technology capabilities introduced over the past couple of years are making a meaningful difference in this competitive environment. With new supply deliveries poised to begin tapering later this year, demand trends remaining stable and occupancy remaining strong, we remain optimistic that leasing conditions should recover quickly and begin improving in early 2025.\n While the transaction market remains slow, we are seeing more acquisition opportunities for new lease-up projects, which Brad will touch on in his comments, and we remain comfortable with our transaction expectation for the year.\n I continue to be optimistic about our ability to work through the current supply cycle with in our high-growth markets ability to absorb new supply. With a 30-year performance record focused on these high-growth markets, we've operated through prior supply cycles.\n Today, we believe our diversified and higher-quality portfolio, our stronger operating platform our stronger balance sheet have us positioned to compete at an even higher level. We're excited about the outlook over the next few years.\n Our high-growth markets continue to offer attractive long-term appeal for employers, households and real estate investors. We have a meaningful future growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries decline and leasing conditions strengthen. Several new technology initiatives will drive further efficiencies and higher operating margins from our existing portfolio and a pipeline of redevelopment opportunities will also drive higher rent growth from our existing properties.\n And finally, our external growth pipeline continues to expand, setting the stage for a meaningful additional NOI growth. I'd like to send my appreciation to our MAA team for a solid start to 2024.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. And Michael, this is Eric. Just to add on to what Tim is saying. I think another thing to keep in mind is when you look at that negative 6% on new lease pricing versus 5% of renewal in terms of a lease-over-lease comparison, that implies, I think, in some people's mind a bigger dollar difference than what's at play really. \n If you look at the actual rent amount that we're achieving on new leases and the actual rent amount that we're achieving on renewals is only -- the spread is only about $150, and that, of course, as Tim mentioned, is kind of the biggest spread we see from a seasonal perspective. And then it tends to narrow a bit over the course of the spring and the summer.\n So the friction cost of moving and some of the other issues you run into moving suggest to us that spread is -- and again, recognizing it's going -- we think, narrow a bit over the spring and summer. We think yields an opportunity for us to continue to achieve the renewal pricing performance along the lines of what we've outlined, and we don't see any particular concerns about the spread in terms of what you're referring to. Adam, this is Eric. Just to add on to what Brad is saying. We spend a lot of time thinking about just how much development risk that we want to put on the platform. And one of the things that we centered around is the idea that we'd like to keep our exposure in forward funding obligations, if you will, no more than around sort of 5% of enterprise values, which based on sort of where pricing is today for us, that would put it at around $1 billion.\n Also recognizing that we've got a lot more of our development increasingly has been through this repurchase program where we are effectively partnering with merchant developers that we know quite well throughout the region, and it enables us to share in some of the risk and some of the downside issues that you could sometimes run into with development.\n So taking our pipeline up a bit from where it is today, not something we would hesitate to do given both the approach that we're taking and just the capacity we have on the balance sheet and in terms of overall enterprise value. So we feel pretty good about pushing on this agenda as much as the numbers will support in terms of what Brad was discussing. Well, we use a number of different sources to compile our view of what the demand horizon and the job growth is going to be. Obviously, a year or so ago, there was more nervousness surrounding the prospects of a more material slowdown in the economy. We have seen some moderation in '24 as compared to certainly '23 and '22, but broadly speaking, we've long believed that these Sun Belt markets had underpinnings associated with them surrounding employer stability and job growth and new jobs coming such that we felt pretty good about the job growth or about the employment markets broadly holding up.\n What has probably been, frankly, more surprising for us is just what's happening in terms of our resident behavior who slightly move-outs to buying a home. The real decline in people leaving to go buy a home and resulting impact that has on demand has probably been the more surprising factor in our thinking about demand projections.\n We weren't really that surprised by the employment market and the migration trends have continued to hold up very similar to what we've experienced for the last few years. So I would say the home buying scenario has probably been the biggest surprise variable for us. And Alex, this is Eric. I'll add on to what Brad is saying. A couple of other things that I think I would point to as well, when you try to contrast and compare the buying environment, the buying opportunity that we thought was going to be forthcoming, contrast that to historical cycles in the past, like coming out of the great financial recession in 2008, 2009, that 2-year period following that fall off. We bought 9,000 apartments in 2 years.\n But a lot of that was a function of, if you will, a real recession, real demand fell off considerably. And anytime you have an environment where the demand is really negatively impacted that can really create some distress. And we just haven't seen that play out this time. Demand has remained very strong.\n And I think that has confidence among a lot of merchant builders and banks to have the ability to sort of hang in there because the demand has been so strong. And then secondly, the thing that's at play here as compared to past cycles where buying opportunities were more plentiful is that there is so much capital on the sidelines now ready to pounce and people know that.\n And so I think just the backdrop of strong demand a lot of investor capital ready to jump into multifamily, particularly in the Sun Belt has enabled the markets in pricing to hold up better than what I think some people thought was likely to happen. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning, and feel free to reach out for other questions and see most of you at NAREIT I'm sure. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Eric mentioned, new lease pricing in the first quarter continued to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries in several of our markets. This, combined with typically slower traffic patterns that are evident this time of the year attributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of negative 6.2%.\n Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong, growing 5%. Because traffic tends to be relatively low as compared to the second and third quarters, we intentionally repriced less than 20% of our leases in the first quarter. The new lease to renewal pricing resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of negative 0.6% for the quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter.\n Average physical occupancy was 95.3%, and collections outperformed expectations with net delinquency representing less than 0.4% of build rents. All these factors drove the resulting revenue growth of 1.4%. From a market perspective, in the first quarter, larger markets such as the Washington, D.C. metro area and Houston continue to hold up well and Nashville showed improvement.\n Many of our mid-tier metros also continue to be steady with Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville, all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint.\n Our diversification between larger and mid-tier markets helps balance performance through the cycle. The improving performance of a market like Nashville, which is getting a lot of new supply, demonstrates the benefit of submarket diversification along with the market diversification. Austin and Jacksonville are two markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets.\n Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives. For the first quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,100 interior unit upgrades. Given the number of units and lease up across our portfolio currently, we expect to renovate fewer units in 2024 than we would in a typical year, but would expect to reaccelerate the program in 2025.\n We have now completed over 94,000 smart home upgrades since the inception of the program, and we expect to complete the remaining few properties this year. For our repositioning program, we have 4 active projects that are in the repricing phase, and we have targeted an additional 6 projects to begin later in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025.\n Regarding April metrics, we are encouraged by the accelerating trends from both the first quarter and March in both pricing and occupancy. April blended pricing is negative 0.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the first quarter and a 70 basis point improvement from March. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter and notably a 70 basis point improvement from March. And renewal pricing of 5.1%, slightly ahead of the first quarter and an improvement of 50 basis points from March.\n Average physical occupancy for April was 95.5%, also up from both the first quarter and March. And as Brad noted, 60-day exposure also remained lower than this time last year at 8.5% versus the prior year of 8.8%. As we've discussed, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, but we still believe the outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter.\n While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, with demand and leasing traffic expected to increase in the spring and summer, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in early to mid-2022. And we've seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about 2 years after construction store.\n While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the first quarter in our markets was the highest for any first quarter in the last 2 decades and the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Job growth is still expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but has recently been revised upwards and growth still expected to be strongest in the Sun Belt region in the country.\n Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerate the key demand factor of household formation. Additionally, we saw a resident turnover continued to decline in the first quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. In fact, the 12.9% of move-outs in the first quarter that were due to a resident buying a home with the lowest ever for MAA.\n That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Clay. Austin this is Tim. Yes, I'll give you a little bit of an overview. I mean I think we're -- as I mentioned in my comments, with where we are in exposure, where we are with occupancy we feel like we're in a good place there. So we'll continue as we get into that, certainly, busier part of the season now, the push on new lease rent growth where we can and balance a little bit depending on property by property.\n It's not necessarily a portfolio-wide decision. We look at everything based on occupancy and exposure by property, but we're comfortable with where occupancy is. We'll continue to push on pricing where we can. As far as the mix between new lease renewal, first quarter was about where we expected it to be with renewals, probably 51% to 49% in terms of the total leases that we did in Q1. I would expect it to blend a little more towards renewals over the next couple of quarters.\n So that's a key thing to keep in mind as you think about pricing trajectory for the rest of the year is that we do expect turnover to remain low, and that the renewals have a little bit heavier weight than the new leases. Yes. I mean there was a little bit more of a push towards occupancy, I would say, in late February and early March is based again looking at it on a targeted basis where exposure was. And that's late February or early March time frame is always the time of the year where you start to see lease expirations pick up and you're kind of waiting on that demand to pick up as it as it has and it starts to do in March.\n So there was a little bit of a lean towards occupancy during that period. And as you saw, as we got into April, we saw acceleration both in pricing and in occupancy from where we're in March. To the first question, yes, we have seen traffic pick up leads, lead volume, and we look at it kind of going back to the exposure factor. We look at leads for exposed unit, and that's as good as what it was. We've kind of talked about we haven't seen a normal year since probably 2018, 2019. So we're sort of exceeding those levels when you think about traffic volume and leads for exposed and all the things that we look at internally for demand.\n I mean, with the March new lease pricing, I mean, it's -- when you get into individual months, it can be volatility, and there's not a ton of leases getting done in the first quarter. So it's going to ebb and flow from month-to-month. What we're looking to see is kind of quarter-to-quarter, see that general trajectory moving up, and we're seeing that and it will play out over the next 3 or 4 months.\n I mean we will reprice about 50% of our leases for the year between May, June, July and August. Obviously, that will be  the biggest part of the impact of what it has on the year, and that's also when we start to see the traffic really pick up. So that's where it will really play out as over these next 3 or 4 months. Yes. This is Tim. I mean at a high level, concession usage is pretty similar to what we saw in Q4. We haven't seen it get materially worse or better. For us as a portfolio was about 0.5% of rents last quarter. It's about 0.4% of rents this quarter. At a market level, it obviously varies a little bit. I would say, again, not a lot of movement from last quarter.\n One market where we've seen it probably get a little bit heavier concession usage is in Charlotte, where we're seeing 1.5 to 2 months there. Austin continues to be, obviously, a heavy concession market, but no worse than really than what we were seeing before, where you've got 1 to 5 months and most of the submarkets in Austin with probably closer to 2, if you think about Central Austin.\n And then the other one we're keeping an eye on, I would say, is Atlanta, we're certainly in the Midtown area, we've seen concession uses pick up a little bit. But broadly, as I said, kind of stable and not seeing quite the usage from developers that we saw late last year. I mean I don't think it needs to necessarily stay at higher levels than what we expected. I think it needs to be at levels that we've seen pretty consistently now for a while. I mean the demand has been there in our markets for a while. Job growth in migration continues. The number of move-outs that we're seeing outside of our -- to outside of our footprint has declined. So that net in migration is pretty consistent with where it's been.\n So it's really just continuing to see the demand at a steady level. And then now as we get into a heavier traffic period, we would expect that to obviously benefit, which is what you didn't see in Q4, Q1 is obviously the lower traffic patterns. But demand is there, and now we're getting into the heavier traffic season and heavier lease expirations, which will have a greater benefit.\n So I think mainly just seeing that demand at a high level, it would take some sort of economic shock, I think, to move it to where it's something that is not attainable in terms of thinking about our guidance. Yes. I mean we're -- this time of the year, there's always a fairly wide spread when you're looking at new leases first renewals. It's gapped out a little bit from where it typically is, but not hugely different, and I expect those spreads to narrow a little bit as we get into the spring and summer.\n Our expectation for renewals, and I think we've talked about a little bit last quarter, it's kind of in that 4.5% to 5% range. We've been closer to 5% right now. We think somewhere in that 4.5%, 4.75% range is reasonable for the rest of the year. And keeping in mind, too, when you think about the lower turnover, those renewals are going to have an outsized impact on the blended leasing spreads more so the new lease pricing.\n And our expectation for new lease pricing, while it is for it to accelerate from here over the next few months and then moderate back down as we get into Q4, still, but it's going to be negative for the full year. We don't expect to see new lease pricing get to 0 or get positive. I think it's probably well into the spring season, spring and summer 2025 before we see that. But that's a high level how we're thinking about it. When you say, are you talking about blended spreads or new lease, you talking about blended? Yes. I mean I don't think it's quite to the level you said on new leases. I mean, a couple of things to keep in mind that we sort of alluded to is one, the Q2 and Q3 will represent about 60%, 65% of all the leases. So -- which is also the strongest period. So that will weigh heavier into the full year blended. And then along with that, we tend to see the renewal portion of that mix tick up even more in Q2 and Q3 as well.\n So you have to -- when you're thinking about a dialed in a heavier weighting on the renewals and dialed in a heavier weighting on the lease spread throughout the year. So yes, I mean, I think we talked about kind of 4.5% to 5% in the renewal range and new leases staying negative, but certainly accelerating from where they are now.\n And then as you get into kind of September and beyond, would expect it to drop back down, not quite to the level we saw in Q4 of last year, but certainly a little bit further negative. But I think the main thing to keep in mind is just the weighting both in terms of leases per quarter and then the weighting between new leases renewals. Yes. I would say that at a high level, the markets that have been strong, continue to be strong, and I would expect to remain strong. And then I'm thinking about D.C. and Houston and then some of the mid-tier markets like Charleston and Richmond and Savannah and Greenville to some extent.\n The ones I would keep an eye on that I think can start really helping some of the Florida markets, both Orlando and Tampa are starting to show some improvement, and we're, I think, a little bit further along in that supply absorption, if you will, than some other markets.\n So those are a couple. And then I remarked about Nashville in the prepared comments as well. That's another one that I think continue to see some benefit from. It's getting a lot of supply and working through it, but where we are in that market is pretty well positioned. So I would say those three beyond the ones that have been pretty steady for us right now. I think really just interpreting to the fact that we have the heavier leasing season ahead of us. Like I said, the first quarter leasing is about 19% of our leases. So we'll do 50% over the next 4 months. That's really when driving -- it's just seeing how it plays out over the next few months, but certainly encourage where the demand side is. Yes. And I'll add to that. I mean, we do track properties in our markets that are in lease-up and how quickly they're leasing up and that sort of thing. And right now that would suggest any concerns from that point. I mean, certainly, as we get later in this year and you get to the fourth quarter, things can change quickly based on what they're doing, but we're not seeing it right now, but that is part of why we certainly dial in, particularly on the new lease side that we think it will moderate back down as you get into the fourth quarter.\n And even though we think supply will be less than it is today, it probably doesn't manifest itself in terms of seeing that in the numbers probably until you get into 2025. Yes. I mean it's pretty consistent, to be honest, where again, we kind of look back to when construction starts and do a lot of looks at different markets of how long it takes to that peak pressure to hit. But -- and most of them are in sort of that Q2 time frame. I would say Atlanta is probably one, that's maybe a little bit behind that curve. Charlotte is one that's probably a little bit behind that curve. And then I would think of a market like Phoenix and we're landing in Tampa probably a little bit ahead of that curve. But at a high level, most are within that range and certainly within a quarter, give or take, of that same range. Yes, for the next couple of months, and we're just wrapping up July now, but for the next couple of months, we're in the 4.6%, 4.7%, 4.8% range. This is Tim, John. I don't think there's anything especially different in the resident. We look at all the sort of the resident demographics are pretty consistent with what they've been the last couple of years. But certainly, it's much more difficult to buy a house. And if you look at our markets in particular, given where interest rates are now, it's about 70% more expensive household than it is our average rent.\n So that's a very significant difference and then you consider cost moving and all that. And so that plays into it. And the other reason that's down is certainly move out to a rent increase or down pretty significantly than what we've seen in the last couple of years as well.\n So I think those two things are driving it and primarily just the cost of buying, which is -- that's always historically along with job transfer by houses that are our highest reason for move out. So I think that's driving it down, combined with the move-out increase. I'd say that's fair. I mean, again, real estate taxes will get the majority of the valuation around that. In late second quarter, early third quarter, we'll probably have a little bit more to say about that in the second quarter call. Same for insurance expense as well. And again, the other expenses pretty much in line with what we've dialed in. This is Tim. I mean, probably not necessarily anything differently on a market-by-market basis, but we've actually updated our website back toward the end of February, which is intended to drive more traffic organically and through to our site as opposed to using some IOSs, which can be quite a bit more expensive. We're getting more involved in some social media things and that type of thing. But it's really just trying to drive people and traffic towards our website and really be able to experience what's there and have a better feel for the community in the neighborhood, and we have everything you want to look at there with floor plans and unit types and all that sort of thing.\n So it's really just continuing to expand how we think about that and how we use technology there as well as getting a little more involved in some of the social media channels. Yes. I mean there's the one highlight that we talked about is something that we think will not only drive down marketing costs but increased demand and the traffic coming in that way. There's a smart home initiative that we've been talking about that we're wrapping up this year. I mean I think over the next 2, 3, 4 years, the biggest initiative in terms of what it can do for margin is continuing sort of our ubiquitous or full property WiFi.\n We have half of our property on a bulk Internet program now. We've been doing that for 3 or 4 years, but there's opportunities for the other half with this even enhanced version of higher margin. I think there's a $30 million more opportunity there. Just on the part of the portfolio that's not on bulk. And then I think as we renegotiate some of those existing contracts, there's huge opportunities there as we look over the next several years."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About half of the favorability was related to the timing of real estate taxes, while the remaining outperformance is related to the collective timing of overhead cost, interest expense and nonoperating income.\n Our same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong rent collections. Excluding the favorable timing of real estate tax expenses, same-store operating expenses were slightly higher than our first quarter guidance, primarily due to onetime property costs.\n During the quarter, we funded approximately $44 million of development cost of the current expected $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $202 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. Although we expect to complete three projects in the second half of 2024 with the additional starts that Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to grow our development pipeline over the remainder of the year, which our balance sheet is well positioned to support.\n During the quarter, we invested a total of $9.4 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio.\n Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments.\n Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.6x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed with an average maturity of 7.2 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. During January, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.\n We have an upcoming $400 million maturity in June that has an effective rate of 4%. Following this maturity, the next scheduled bond maturity is in the fourth quarter of 2025. Finally, with the bulk of leasing season ahead of us, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our core FFO guidance for the year while slightly tightening the full year range to $8.70 to $9.06 per share. We are also maintaining our same store as well as other key guidance ranges for the year.\n That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions. Haendel, this is Clay. Right now, we're seeing anywhere between 5.6% and 5.7% as we look to that maturity. Sure, Jamie. This is Clay. Just speaking to the first quarter and what we saw there. The biggest -- the slight unfavorable we had there that we called out in the comments, was really around some onetime property costs around some storm damages that we had at a number of properties, nothing significant, but it was a bit of -- a bit outside of what we were dialing in for the quarter.\n As we think about going forward through the rest of the year, I mean, we're still early on. And when you look to what our larger expense line items are specifically real estate expenses, we still need some more information there before we can really peg that number, but we still feel very confident about our guidance that we set forth on real estate tax expenses at about 4.75% growth year-over-year.\n Also, insurance expenses will, although a much smaller component of our operating expense stack, still some more information to come on it as well. When you think about personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and the other line items that are touching there, we feel confident about those, and those trended in line with what we were expecting for first quarter, and we expect those to continue in that same manner over the remainder of the year."

In preparation for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in 2025 through at least 2028, we continue to make progress in putting our balance sheet capacity to work to deliver future earnings growth.\n Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on a 302-unit prepurchase development in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we expect to start construction this quarter on a 345-unit project under our prepurchase development platform in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA.\n Both projects are expected to deliver first units by mid-2026, and deliver stabilized NOI yields in the mid-6% range consistent with what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing.\n With the addition of these two projects, our active development pipeline represents 2,617 units at a total cost of approximately $866 million. With continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains low. But we have seen cap rates firm up a bit from fourth quarter with market cap rates on deals we track that closed in the first quarter, averaging approximately 5.1%, 30 basis points lower than the previous quarter.\n Despite the low transaction volume, our team continues to find compelling select acquisition opportunities. We currently have an off-market 306-unit suburban property in Raleigh under contract to acquire for approximately $81 million that we expect to close this month. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease up at 49% occupancy and is expected to stabilize in mid- to late 2025.\n At this point, we believe our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. Despite the increased pressure from new supply, our 4 developments that are actively leasing 3 of which are under construction and 1 that has completed and is in lease-up continue to deliver good performance.\n While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment with concessions on select units, up from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, we continue to achieve rents on average approximately 18% above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOI and earnings and creating additional long-term shareholder value.\n For these 4 projects, we expect to achieve an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%, exceeding our original expectations by 70 basis points. We continue to make progress on the predevelopment work for a number of projects. In addition to the two 2nd quarter development starts I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year.\n While we have not seen a broad reduction in construction costs, encouragingly, we have achieved some level of reduction on our recent pricing supporting our ability to start construction on these projects. We have seen better subcontractor bid participation, which we expect to lead to better execution with stronger subs throughout the construction process for our new starts.\n We are hopeful that the significant drop in construction starts that we've seen in our region will lead to more substantial construction cost declines. As we progress through the year, allowing us to start construction on additional opportunities in our development pipeline, which today consists of 10 well-located sites that we either own or control, representing additional growth of nearly 2,800 units.\n We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined in our execution timing. Any project we start this year will deliver first units in 2026 and 2027 aligning with what is likely to be a strong leasing environment, supported by significantly lower supply.\n Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this liquidity-constrained environment, it's possible we could add additional in-house and prepurchase development opportunities to our current and future pipeline.\n While we continue to pursue numerous external growth opportunities, our existing portfolio remains in a good position heading into the busier leasing season. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets currently outperforming.\n As Tim will outline further, despite the high level of new supply, we continue to see solid demand and absorption, leading to improved current occupancy with future exposure better than this time last year.\n Our collections are strong and near pre-COVID levels at 99.6% of billed rents. Our resident base is stable with more residents choosing to live with us longer, supported by our focus on customer service, coupled with high single-family housing costs.\n Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for all you do to improve our business and serve our residents and those around you while exceeding expectations of those that depend on us.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim. Brad, this is Brad. Yes, I think relative to that comment, it's a realization that the high level of supply that we are seeing today is partly a result of cheap financing that's been available over the last couple of years and just realizing that in general, those times are behind us. And so getting back to a more normal supply environment going forward into the future.\n I do think over the next couple of years, the supply environment will be below long-term averages, but perhaps we get back closer to long-term averages as we get out a few years. But then when you layer on top of that, just the demand strength that we are seeing in our region of the country leads us to believe that the fundamentals could be very, very good for a number of years. This is Brad. Yes, I would comment that the yields that we're expecting on our new starts for this year are in the mid-6% range, which is consistent with what we're delivering today on our existing development portfolio. So that is a pretty good spread from where current cap rates are, call it, low 5s as I mentioned in my comments. So we're still in that call it, 150 basis points spread or so range with current cap rates, which feels really good to us.\n And in terms of construction costs, I mentioned in my comments, we haven't seen a broad reduction in construction costs. It's really market specific. There are some markets where the supply pipeline is really dropped faster and quicker and earlier than other markets, we're seeing some cost reduction in those markets.\n There are others, for example, the two projects that we are starting, we have seen our partners have been able to get construction cost reductions without scope reductions in those projects, which I think is a positive for both of those, but we're not seeing across the board construction cost reduction in our markets in general. Yes. So the Raleigh lease-up deal is a 6% NOI yield is what we're expecting out of that. And I'm sorry, I missed the very first part of your question. Yes. I mean I think if you look at where we sit today, as we've said over the last few quarters, the transaction market has been quiet for a couple of years, but the supply is up. So we just feel like the need to transact continues to build while we're not seeing transactions I think the difficulty has been the volatility on interest rates has really slowed the market down from transactions occurring.\n But I'll tell you, just looking at our underwriting deals that we've reviewed, the volume is up. There's more coming out. There's more in the market right now. I think we -- first quarter, what we underwrote was double what it was in fourth quarter. It's still not to where it was a couple of years ago. So we do believe that, that volume just continues to grow from where we sit today. And I would say the other thing that gives us confidence really is just our history in the Sun Belt.\n Eric mentioned we've been focused exclusively on this region for 30 years, and we have a reputation of performance in our region of the country, whether it's on the operating side or transaction side. So we get a lot of looks and opportunities that perhaps others do not get. The Raleigh opportunity specifically was an off-market opportunity that we got, and I think we'll have other opportunities like that.\n Our relationships are pretty strong and deep in this region of the country, especially with the merchant developers who are the largest builders in this region. If you look at what we purchased over the last 10 years, almost $2 billion, over 80% of that was from merchant developers. So we have a very good relationship with all of those folks. And we think that will lead to additional opportunities as we go through the year. This is Brad, and I'll start, Tim can add to it. We do have a little bit of insight in that just via a couple of avenues. One, the comp properties all of our properties. We monitor specifically how our comps are performing. And then also, as I mentioned earlier, we just have relationships with all the developers in the market.\n And I would say just in general, from the information that we have, we're seeing a more measured approach to concession usage this time this year than we did in the third, fourth quarter of last year. And we're not seeing as much pressure from the developers at this point in terms of pushing to get ahead of the supply wave. We're in the supply wave now.\n So now they're starting to look at potentially monetizing and transacting their properties and leaning too heavily into concessions at this point is going to severely impact their valuation. So they're being a bit more measured at this time of the year than they were last year from what we can see at this point. Adam, this is Brad. Certainly, we have been building development as a capability and a tool for us to lean into over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have a pipeline of projects that we could start and really deliver value over the next couple of years. Really what's preventing us from doing that more broadly, has just been hitting the returns that we need on our developments.\n As I mentioned, the two that we're starting in the second quarter we're able to get some construction cost reductions out of those to get the yields to where we think, call it that 100 to 150 basis point spread to cap rates puts us in that 6% to 6.5% range. And the two that we're starting are in that 6.5% range.\n So we feel really good about those developments where they're located. The markets, the ability to layer our platform onto those when they deliver and drive additional efficiencies long term. But we expect, as I mentioned, we've started -- we'll start two here in the second quarter, another one to two by the end of this year. And then we have another three that we have approvals in place and ready to go, if we're able to get construction costs down far enough to make the numbers work at those hurdles that I mentioned.\n But aside from those, again, we are continuing to evaluate the land market. We're continuing to evaluate our prepurchase opportunities. There could be opportunities that emerge in that area where a merchant developer that we have a relationship with perhaps has an equity partner that backs out or can't raise debt or something along those lines that provides us another opportunity to lean into that area.\n So development is an area that we continue to focus on and believe strongly in terms of creating long-term value through that avenue. So to the extent that we continue to get the returns that make sense, we'll continue to execute in that area. John, this is Brad. I don't think that these cap rates are representative of below-market debt. I mean I don't think there's many loan assumptions that are in these numbers that I'm quoting. And some of these are reflective of very recent transactions as of a few days ago, where we've gotten the cap rate information.\n So these are very current numbers in terms of yields. I mean, honestly, the spread of cap rates is wider than what it has been in the past. I mean the spread that we're seeing right now is from 4.5% to, call it, 5.5% and really, again, averaging in that low 5% range.\n So in terms of where debt is today, it's in the -- debt rates are in the high 5% range, almost 6%. So my assumption would be that these underwritings either are assuming a run-up in fundamentals or refinance in a couple of years where they're able to take the interest rate back down. Well, we're not. If you look at the Raleigh acquisition, for example, that's representative and the two acquisitions that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. That's representative of where we're willing to transact, which from a yield perspective, has been in the high 5s and then the Raleigh transaction was a 6% yield.\n That's where we are comfortable transacting. And we believe, again, based on our ability our balance sheet strength, ability to close all cash and things of that nature, focusing on properties that are in lease-up that are hard to finance that selectively, we'll be able to find some opportunities to help us hit our $400 million forecast. But at a broad market level of a 5% or so cap rate, at this point, we're not active in that in that price range. Jamie, this is Brad. I think as we look at where we want to deploy capital, broadly speaking, the high-growth regions of where we're located is what we're targeting. And that's going to be both our larger markets as well as some of our mid-tier markets that you mentioned. I mean in Tim's prepared comments, he noted some of the mid-tier markets that are performing quite well right now.\n Our larger markets. We are committed to those. I think when we combine both of those components as part of our story, it's part of the diversification that we're looking for, for our earnings stream, and I think they perform well together.\n So I would say you would see us focus on both components there in terms of growing. I would also just say that as we focus on buying new properties generally that are in lease-up, where the average age over the last 10 years that we purchased has been 1 year.\n So these are brand-new properties generally, those are going to follow a little bit of where the supply is. That's where the opportunities are going to be that we're going to find. But broadly speaking, both segments of our portfolio will be areas that we focus on. Yes, it's going to be different based on each market. But I would say, in general, '24 is going to be flattish. But you also have to remember that on our deals that we're underwriting on an acquisition, the leases are predominantly new leases, which is different than our existing portfolio, but we're generally bringing all new leases into the portfolio.\n So it's going to be flattish year 1, 2025 is going to have a positive uptick and '26 and '27 are going to be higher than long-term averages on average. Yes. This is Brad. I think there's really two components of that. I would say, number one, we have seen a number of loans, specifically in 2023. The last number I saw was 85% of the loans that were coming due, we're pushed. We're extended in 2023.\n So I do think there is a component of that, that has occurred. I think relative to developers, specifically, I think for them, over the last couple of years, there's been a change in how they have approached their construction lending, in the term that they're able to get in their construction loans now is longer than what I have ever seen it before, where they're able to get 4 to 5 years in their term of their construction loans.\n And a lot of times, they have the ability built in if they're hitting certain coverage ratios, they're able to extend that 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. there are certain components built into those loans that I think are allowing developers to be a little bit more runway before they're forced to sell on new construction loans. So I think those two components are really addressing that."
