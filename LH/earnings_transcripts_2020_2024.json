At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Clarissa Willett.\nClarissa Willett: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 2021 guidance and the related assumptions including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company\u2019s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial conditions, our responses to and the expected future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business more generally as well as on general, economic, business and market conditions. Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change. And now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I cover 2020 results, I want to first thank Clarissa for her leadership in Investor Relations for the last several years. Clarissa has been promoted to lead our revenue cycle management team, which is a very important role. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Chas Cook, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations, and will continue to strengthen the foundation built upon by the IR team. Chad has been a strong leader in our finance organization since he joined LabCorp in 2018. Moving now to 2020 results. 2020 will be remembered for many things, including the fight against COVID and the tragic loss that it brought. It also emphasizes the critical importance of frontline healthcare workers and scientists, amongst others.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2021 guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, an increase of 52% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 50.1%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 46.4% and organic base business growth of 3.7%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 0.6%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or 28.8% of revenue compared to $336 million or 11.4% last year. During the quarter, we had $46 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $91 million of amortization, which was higher than recent quarters. As part of our new branding initiative, we are transitioning out of the Covance trading. As a result, we are accelerating the amortization of its trade name over the next year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 31.8% of revenue compared to $422 million or 14.3% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by PAMA, higher personnel costs and investments to support the company's new branding initiative. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% compared to 22.4% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.8% compared to 22.9% last year. The higher adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For modeling purposes, we expect the company's adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be comparable to 2020 at approximately 25%. This does not include any potential increase in the federal tax rate in 2021. Net earnings for the quarter were $938 million or $9.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items were $10.56 in the quarter, up from $2.86 last year. Operating cash flow was $775 million in the quarter, compared to $570 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital to support growth. The higher working capital was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivables and supplies related to COVID testing.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I was wondering if you could start and just provide a little additional color on the assumption in the guidance for 2021 COVID testing. By my math, it seems that it assumes the COVID sales are going to be essentially zero in the second half of the year. I think that's a world we all want to live in, but I'm not sure if that's exactly how it's going to play out. So it would just be great to be a little bit more on your philosophy there.\nAdam Schechter: Hi, Jack. Good morning and thanks for the question. The reason we had to give such a wide range, minus 35% to minus 50% for the testing is because, as you say, it's very difficult to have precision. And you could get to the minus 35% to minus 50% in several different ways. Right now, we've seen a decline in tests, if you look at the last several weeks versus the end of 2020. If that decline continued, and then you saw it continue throughout the whole year, you could get there. If the amount of testing we're doing today, on average, was maintained for the six months of this year - in the first six months, well, then you could do zero for the second half of the year and still be there. So there are multiple different ways to get there. My assumption going in is that the price is going to remain at where it is right now. So right now, it's $100. We're still in the emergency situation. That's been extended through the year. You have to hit the CMS guidelines, which is basically for the previous month. You have to have more than 50% at a two-day turnaround. And then they look at each sample for the current month. We're well within that range. I mean right now, we did 275,000 tests a day. We're not doing anywhere near that in our turnaround times about a day. So, I expect that the price you should assume is still about what we've averaged until now. I think for this quarter, it was about $90 on average. It then comes down to the volume. And I assume that the volume is going to continue to decline, albeit maybe at a lower rate than we saw from the end of last year into this year. And then for the second half of the year, they'll be significantly less than the first half of this year. That's our base case assumption.\nGlenn Eisenberg : And Jack, just to reinforce it, too, one of the reasons we did break out the level of COVID testing separate from our Base Business, just given that we put a wider range around something that we feel is more uncertain versus, frankly, having better visibility on just the performance of our Base Business.\nJack Meehan: Yes, I like the way you laid it out. I think it's helpful just for teasing out the parts. On that last point on the base business, Glenn, I was wondering if you could provide some more color. I think saw a little bit of the same dynamic from last quarter where it looks like maybe there's some mix benefit or additional test per rec. What's going on there between kind of core volume versus mix?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, Jack. As you saw from a revenue standpoint, what was nice is that we saw the 0.5% growth in revenues in the quarter. So it's the first time we've seen the positive to your point, it's a combination that we still saw lower volumes down 7.7%, but still that's an improvement as we trended through the earlier parts of the year. And it was more than offset by favorable price/mix and we continue to see an unusually high level of favorable mix, primarily driven by higher test prerecession. So the feeling is with the fewer visits that patients are going, they're conducting more tests per visit that they're going through. So again, as we think going forward and reflected in the guidance is we'll continue to see over time, the pickup in our base volumes. But with that, you'll see the core level core lever, if you will. You'll start to see that favorable mix start to come back down to more historical levels.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nDan Leonard: So first question, can you talk about on the drug development business, the contribution of COVID trials to either sales or bookings and the outlook there?\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So first thing is, if you look at the drug development business which is 16%, but if you take out the PCR testing, we had growth of 8.4% which was strong growth and we did well across all of our businesses. If you look at COVID right now, basically, the COVID trials accounted for about 12% of our net orders, if you look at the last 3 quarters. So you can see that it's meaningful, but a lot of our growth is coming from outside of COVID trials. And we mentioned in the last quarter that we won a large pharma's oncology book of business. I think that's helpful to us, but also we've won another pharma's non-oncology business. So we continue to show strength outside of COVID, which is very important as we move forward to the base business. That's what gives us confidence as we look at the range we provided for the drug development business for this year.\nDan Leonard: And then just a follow-up on the Diagnostics business. Adam, you mentioned the work with the CDC on sequencing for COVID surveillance. How do we think about the economics of that or frame that? Is that - could that be a meaningful part of your business? Or is it - or were you just trying to emphasize the high science there? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So right now, we're doing a couple of thousand sequences a week for the CDC. We can increase that significantly. We're working with them to see what numbers they might like us to go to. That's more science and more for the benefit of understanding the mutations. We could use it for drug development and understand what we need to do in the future with drug development. But I wouldn't look at that as a separate, significant revenue stream.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Adam, when we spoke about a month ago, I think, I asked you a question around the tie between diagnostics and drug development, and did it make sense for the two entities to be together. You clearly put up a great number, obviously, on both sides, but especially on the drug development side for book-to-bill. Can you talk about outside of COVID, the tie you're seeing between drug development and diagnostics for winning business? Is this helping in some way? Any of the correlation that you see between those two businesses? And then lastly, how do we think about virtual trials playing into all of this?\nAdam Schechter: Sure. So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having diagnostic and drug development together, is a winning scenario. And that you can do significantly better with drug development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no doubt in my mind that we've seen that with COVID. I mean, being able to do the diagnostic test of what we're doing drug development, enable us to win more than 400 opportunities across COVID. At the same time, I believe that people now have seen it in pharma and biotech. So it opens up the doors for other areas. We won large Pharmas oncology business. I think oncology is the next area that we'll be able to show the benefit of having diagnostic capabilities, particularly Companion Diagnostic capabilities along with drug development. And we are beginning to see in the biotech and pharma clients that this is mattering more and more. So I continue to be very bullish about the ability to have both these businesses together. I've always said that, I think that the drug development business benefits more by having diagnostic capabilities than diagnostics does by having drug development. But with that said, we've seen some synergies going the other way, where the drug development group has been working on Companion Diagnostics, and we're able to potentially launch that in the diagnostic area. So I'm actually seeing benefit to diagnostics over time from drug development. So we continue to make progress there. If you look at virtual and hybrid trials, the reason we've invested there is because I believe it's going to be more important than it's been in the past. And it's been talked about for quite some time. I don't think a lot of pharma companies were willing to go there because they know how to do the other trials, and we still have to get regulators to approve how to look at virtual hybrid trials. But with COVID, all that has changed. And \u2013 there are still about 20% to 30% of clinical sites that are not open. And if you start a trial now, you want to make sure if there's another event that, for example, if in November, there's a new variant and you need another vaccine. There could be another impact from COVID later this year. You don't want your trials to be interrupted. You want to have the possibility to do virtual and hybrid trials. So I think it's going to serve, number one, as a backup to, ensure that trials can continue. Number two, I believe that, particularly in specialty areas, you're going to see more and more use of the hybrid trials. Because what we're seeing is they can work and they can work well, and they can actually allow you to potentially enroll more patients faster. And therefore, I think it's here to stay now that we've seen it work.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nErin Wright: Quickly on the Diagnostics segment. Has anything changed in terms of your thoughts around serology testing here? Do you think that will pick up vaccine utilization? Or is that minimal in terms of your assumptions and the guidance at this point?\nAdam Schechter: That's an important question. It's a very important scientific question. We are very specific to say, COVID testing and not break apart PCR and serology because it could go in multiple different directions. I think if you end up having to have a vaccine every year, serology might not be that important. If you need a vaccine every several years, then I believe serology will be very important. And the real question is going to be, what level, what's the quantitative analysis that you need for a certain level of antibodies to feel like you're protected. If there is a quantitative number, that people can feel comfortable they can fly, they can go to events, that they can do many other things, then it will be very important. And what we're doing is we're preparing for that just in case. So we already have the ability to do a semi quantitative antibody test, which I think would help if you have to get to a certain level, know what that level is. And we're going to be prepared to scale that. We already have - we can run thousands, but I want to be prepared in case we need hundreds of thousands in the future. It's just too early to know from the science, and we're learning so much about the variance and so forth, that there'll be more to come as we go through this year.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Erin, the only other thing I'd add for that is that, as Adam said, COVID testing the guidance that we gave down under the $35 million to $50 million is our expectation for the full year. But while serology is a small piece of that, frankly, from our guidance in the range that we have, we would actually have a range where serology testing would go up at the upper end of the range, could go down again at the lower end of the range, versus the PCRs, to your point, is once the vaccines are readily available, more interest in seeing if the antibodies are there. But again, it's a smaller piece of the total COVID business that we have.\nErin Wright: And then on capital deployment, can you speak to the consolidation opportunity across the core lab business? What does the deal pipeline look like now? And does the broader installed base of wind care instruments and other concepts change or delay or your thought process, I guess, around deal activity in the near term? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So as I look at capital deployment, the first thing we look forward to see if there are hospital laboratories, local or regional laboratories that we can acquire. And those make a lot of sense. They are accretive in the first year, typically, you return your cost of capital in about two years, and we know how to integrate those. We are seeing more opportunities for those. We're spending a lot more time and discussions with various hospitals and local laboratories. And I can tell you, even as a senior management team, we're spending a lot more time in those discussions ourselves. So I feel good that there will be multiple opportunities as we go through this year. The second thing I look for is strategic acquisitions. So if there's something in one of the pillars of our strategy, for example, oncology, that we need to acquire in order to be successful, we would look to do something like that. And those would be kind of smaller tuck-in type of acquisitions versus large-scale mega deals. And then the third thing we look at is the share buybacks. If you ask me about large-scale acquisitions, so for example, another large CRO, I don't think we need to do that. I think we have what we need to be successful. So we're mostly interested in laboratory, hospital laboratories, local retail laboratories and strategic acquisitions helping us in the pillars.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Just wanted to go back on the commentary around visibility on the core trends and maybe the assumptions and comfort around those core trends. And more specifically, when I look at the numbers compared to 2019, and I look at the lab side, midpoint, looks like, it's about 4% growth. And then on the CRO side, it looks like it's about 15% growth off that sort of 2019 baseline. So anything to call out there on either side around sort of the visibility you talked about that bridges the growth?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, Ralph. Yeah. From our perspective, it's kind of an interesting viewpoint because as we go into 2021 and look at a comp to 2020, obviously, we see significant growth in both - in our base businesses because it's coming off of the pandemic here. As we look back to 2019 kind of pre pandemic levels, to your point, your growth rates, we actually look at it even on a compound growth rate, let's say, is that kind of fitting in within our historical growth rates. And the guidance range that we have kind of implies, obviously, we're getting a range. But for both businesses, clearly at the upper end of the range that we're back to kind of the normal historical growth. And so as we think about the pieces, so first, within diagnostics, while we've already seen a favorable revenue trend in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, so revenue is already there, but our volume wasn't. We were down, call it, around 8% in the fourth quarter. So the range that we have as we look to 2019 is that, for the most part, call it, the mid part of the guidance that the volume now will get back to 2019 levels, call it, in the midyear to second half of the year. And again, the price will come down to more historical levels as well. But similarly, within the drug development side of the business, we've already had good growth compared to a year ago, and we expect that to continue relative to 2019 levels, where, again, the range, if you looked at it as a CAGR to 2019 similarly, within the range, gets us back to our historical growth rates, again, depending where you are in the range. So with the recognition that there's still going to be some softness in the base business that's expected in the first half of 2021 because of the pandemic still here the vaccine not broadly available. But clearly, with the second half of the year expectations, we're now growing relative to 2019 at a more historical level.\nRalph Giacobbe: And then just a follow-up on the $100 commentary for COVID testing. I just want to make sure that's across your managed care book as well. And has there been any discussion or pushback, if you will, with managed care or perhaps the argument of a lower rate for maybe more favorable pricing terms on sort of that base business longer term? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So average price is about $90. And of course, we're happy discussion with managed care. But as the volume has gone down significantly, and we see the testing not where it was, say, back in December, those discussions continue to happen, but I think we have a very strong rationale based upon the CMS price and guidance.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Yes. Wouldn't you know, Ralph, got my two questions kind of wrapped up in the last one there, but I'm going to just jump off that a little bit. I mean, ultimately, I think I was going in the same direction, which is peeling back the layers of the onion on diagnostics on the base business. You clearly you have a lot of layers. You have hospital lab management, which impacts revenue and pricing, but not volumes, you have easy comps, you have no PAMA, M&A, even a little FX. It sounds like you're saying the 2021 core-based volumes maybe start the year below 2019, finish the year the second half above 2019. So are you basically seeing a flat year on volume in total or maybe a little bit of growth in total? And then I have a follow-up clarification after that.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Again, Eric, it's where you looking at it relative to the range. So part of the supplemental information that we provided, we actually did give, call it compound growth rates for the businesses based on the Base Business and COVID testing to kind of frame the growth. To your point, within that, obviously, there is some M&A and currency that impacts the numbers. But as we think about, again, the volume for Diagnostics, depending where you are in the range, at some point, we're going to cross over to being favorable volume. And so again, at the midpoint of the range, just assume that's relatively midpoint of the year. After that point, we're then looking at getting back to more historical growth rates. But even there, the trajectory of the recovery could be stronger. It could be a little softer. But overall, we do expect to see, depending on where you are from the range to - for the full year, we could be still below on volume for the full year, but favorable on price/mix. Or at the upper end of the range, we can be both favorable on volume as well as favorable on price for the full year. So again, just a very degree of how fast the recovery will come and how much it accelerates.\nEric Coldwell: My quick follow-up here is within Diagnostics, obviously, you are doing M& A. You have a positive outlook on M&A. I'm curious what percentage growth in that 11% to 13.5% base, what percent of that is actually M&A driven as opposed to not?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So when you look at the guidance that we provide for, call it, for both of our businesses. The M&A that's associated in our guidance range is all deals that have been done in the past. So you're just getting the annualization part of that growth, if you will. In our enterprise numbers, we do assume that part of our capital allocation will go to M&A. So we reflect some of that growth in revenue at the enterprise level for that. But if you think about just the level of M&A in the quarter that we had, for Diagnostics was 0.9%. So obviously, we'll look to see that number be a smaller piece within the guidance range that we had for 2021, subject to any deals that we do would be additive to that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eugene Kim with Wolfe Research.\nEugene Kim: Thank you, and congrats on the strong quarter. I guess a quick follow-up to Ralph's question earlier on the COVID side. You are expecting Base Business revenues to come in about 15% higher than 2019 at the midpoint. Can you maybe break down how much of that is driven by COVID related trials versus non-COVID business?\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes. So if you look at the growth that we had for the fourth quarter, it was very strong. It was about 8.4% if you take out the PCR testing. And its strength is coming from all three businesses. It's coming from the early stage, the central laboratory as well as the clinical development business. As we look at the COVID trials and what they accounted for, it was about 12% of our net orders across the last three quarters. So you can see that it's meaningful, but it's not that much. We still would have had great growth even without the COVID trials in terms of our net orders.\nEugene Kim: And quickly on share repo, apologies if I missed this, but have you provided how much buyback you're assuming in your full year EPS guidance?\nGlenn Eisenberg : No. Eugene, what we've said is that that we expect to target the free cash flow that we generate this year to both M&A and the buybacks. So assume that we will be in the market each quarter within buybacks, but the level of buybacks will be, as Adam commented earlier, driven off of the amount of acquisitions we do. And we have a good pipeline of deals. But like in most years, or at least most normal years, always expect it to be - they're not mutually exclusive that we expect to continue to do, strategic M&A acquisitions as well as repurchasing shares with our excess cash flow. But we've not quantified the amount, but obviously, it would be within a range of our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: So two quick ones here. As you think about deals for 2021, obviously, the COVID tailwinds helps out some of the smaller hospital labs are struggling previously. Do you think that deals will sort of pause during 2021 as COVID tailwinds normalize and so wait until 2022 until the normal environment comes back?\nAdam Schechter: No. I think the deals are going to continue to be at least at the same pace in Paseo. In fact, I think there might be some acceleration based upon the number of discussions that we're having. And I think there's a couple of reasons why one is, for example, hospitals have realized how capital-intensive this business is. So many hospitals had to update their labs to be able to do COVID testing at any scale. And as they start to look at keeping those labs updated outside of COVID, they realize they probably need to do some additional upgrading to the equipment. So they'd rather use that capital for example, for a new surgery suite versus us having to just update the lab to run the test that they've done in the past. The second thing is that even though COVID has been significant, many of the hospitals haven't had their base business back to the level that we've seen, and they don't have the COVID testing ability that we have. So the COVID testing has not necessarily offset the other base business issues that they face. So I feel pretty good about deals this year, and I don't think it will slow down. If anything, I think it will be the same or accelerate.\nPito Chickering: Next question, your capacity for COVID testing is obviously above the demand right now, and you're guiding to a decline throughout 2021. If I think about COVID testing globally, there's still a lot of countries that don't have the capacity to test as the U.S. does. Is there any opportunity to use the excess testing capacity to work with other countries to assist in their COVID testing?\nAdam Schechter: So we do testing in Canada. We also have the capacity to do some testing in the U.K. because we have a lab there that has the equipment. Outside of that, we don't necessarily do testing in any other country. The U.S. is obviously where we do the vast, vast majority of the testing. What I'd worry about with other countries has turned around time. Would it be easy to get the samples to the U.S. and turn those around fast enough. And then the ability to move equipment or have equipment in those other parts of the world, I don't think is necessarily that feasible. So the good news is that there are many additional alternatives that are coming to market. And I think that most countries right now have learned how to use the testing they have. In some countries don't use nearly as much testing as the U.S. So for example, in Japan, they do significantly less testing even though they have the capacity that they could do more if they chose to. So I think it really is country-by-country based on how they approach it. And it's not in our plan to expand outside of where we currently are for testing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of  with UBS.\nAdam Noble: This is Adam Noble on for Kevin. I just wanted to go back to kind of PCR volumes, understanding that the infection rates have gone down. And to the extent that those continue to go down, that would be a headwind to the PCR volumes. But I think from your previous comments, you guys have - because of the active infections, you haven't had a chance to go too far down the pipeline of back to work, back-to-school, asymptomatic testing. And just curious if you could comment on your pipeline there and what are your expectations for those volumes as the year progresses?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Adam. And again, the reason we gave such wide guidance of minus 35% to minus $50, because there's still so many unknowns. For back to work, back-to-school, we've been a big part of that. But many companies have not gone back to work yet, and you see more and more companies saying that they might not go back to work in the ways that they've done it in the past. Some of the companies that we're working with were actually using point-of-care testing to help them get up and running. Some were using our Pixel by LabCorp at home tests where they can send them to employees, particularly if they have large sales forces across the country. It's a very easy way for them to do it. So our LabCorp employee services, is very busy with back to work and back-to-school. And it really is just a matter of how many of those tests do you do while you're also vaccinating people. And then at the end of the day, frankly, it's going to come down to in the fall, where there'll be another strain, and will there be another outbreak will be a big flu season, and everybody has flu, you're going to want a test for both COVID and for flu. So, I do believe that there's opportunity in the second half of the year potentially, it's just too hard to know right now, and that's why we gave you such a wide range of possibilities.\nAdam Noble: That makes a ton of sense. Maybe just to sneak on in on Covance. Appreciate the guidance you guys gave on it breaking out the COVID side specifically. Just curious if you could kind of break that out further between COVID trial work versus the Central Lab impact that's obviously benefited at the end of this year. But if volumes come down for COVID testing, I guess we could probably expect that to come down as the year progresses as well.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I think if you look at the different parts. So for example, Central Laboratory work, we've been very busy, but we would probably fill that with other potential opportunities. So to me, it's kind of we're building capacity. We're doing both COVID and non-COVID Central Laboratory work, and we're very busy in Central Laboratories, as you can imagine. In terms of the trials, again, we're doing mostly non-COVID trials, clinical trials, but we're also doing some COVID clinical trials. I think the best way for you to kind of engage it is to know that the trials were 12% of our net orders over the last three quarters. That should give you the best sense of what that's going to look like over time. I don't think it's going to slow down a lot this year. I think there's going to be more work that you're going to need for variance for vaccines, for example. There's still a lot of anti-virals that are being studied. So I do think for this year, you're going to still see significant work for Covance. And then we'll have to see where it ends up as we go to next year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Adam, in response to one of the questions, I think you said something really interesting in terms of the pricing dynamics and the fact that you're seeing higher number of tests per visits or fewer visits and more tests. Do you think that this is sort of a new sort of step-up in the demand curve? Or is this sort of a temporary catch up?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, Ricky, it's a very important question. We have that discussion often amongst ourselves. I believe that because people are not going to their doctor as often as they have, where they may have missed their wellness programs that when the doctors are seeing the patients who are just trying to get as many tests on as they can to make sure they can treat that patient appropriately. I do not personally believe it's going to be a long-term sustainable number of tests per acquisition. I think we'll get back to closer to where it was. But we're also trying to understand the difference between telemedicine and doctor visits. And if there's a difference there, we don't think there is, but we're still trying to understand that. So our base case assumes that as the business comes back and starts to grow again, that it's not based upon increasing numbers of tests per acquisition. It's based upon more people going to their physicians.\nRicky Goldwasser: And to your point on telemedicine, it's interesting, right? Because is it about 50% of our acquisitions that are done in your sites versus physician offices. Do you think that there's anything that's going to impact physician behavior because they're not getting reimbursed for drawing the specimen when it's a telehealth visit?\nAdam Schechter: You know, Ricky, I think that, first of all, telemedicine has been very important as we've gone through the pandemic. I think that there have been some restrictions that have lifted that will probably stay lifted in terms of being able to do things over state lines and so forth. And I think it's going to be important to understand it more as we move forward. The good news for LabCorp is that we're involved with almost every major telemedicine company. So if they can easily access the ability to get testing done for patients. And we have so many service centers across the country, including the ones through Walgreens that I believe that we're easily accessible to patients, whether it's in their physicians' offices or through telemedicine. But I do believe it's here to stay, and a - that we're part of it and we're able to make it an easy transition through their EMRS.\nRicky Goldwasser: And then just one last one on the utilization. You broke for us the core revenue growth. I think, sort of, 4% for the year, half from M&A, half organic. How should we think about utilization exit run rate in 2021?\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes. So Ricky, the - as we talked about just thinking about it as organic core volume for us. We were down 7.7%. So we saw a good trend throughout the year. As you'll recall, we ended the third quarter - call it 8.9%, but the end of the quarter was more like an 8% number. So we have seen that the base volumes have stabilized. We've seen that throughout the quarter. And frankly, we've seen it also into January of this year. Obviously, we're going to start to see the favorable comps as we compare against a pandemic year in 2020. But again, as we talked about earlier, when we look at the range of guidance we gave for the business, depending upon where we are in the range of guidance that we do expect to see, call it midyear into the second half of the year as the midpoint of the guidance that you should see the organic volumes be picking up relative to 2019 levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair.\nMatt Larew: I appreciate that there's a wide range potential COVID volumes built into your guidance. But could you maybe comment on whether this is, sort of, your perspective on how the COVID testing market is going to evolve overtime? So in other words, is it going to evolve into more of a point-of-care market like flu where reference aren't really playing much of a role unlike it's a reflex? Or maybe do you think it's going to go away entirely? Just an update on how the broader market is going to evolve?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Hi, Matt. I think it's going to depend on the treatments that we have available and the anti-virals and how effective they are. If at the end of the day, you're diagnosed with COVID in the future, but we know you're not going to end up in a hospital, you're going to die because we have great ways to treat it, then I think it could become point-of-care testing like flu. If it's as serious as it is today, where people aren't vaccinated, they could end up in a hospital to end of time then I think it's going to end up PCR testing, particularly for people with symptoms. Because we do know that the point-of-care testing is not necessarily as accurate, and you do miss some people through that. I don't think you're going to want to miss people if they can end up in a hospital die. So I think it's really going to it takes some time for us to understand how good the therapeutics work outside of vaccinations. Because when you think about it, if 20% or 25% of the population doesn't get vaccinated, and if the vaccine doesn't work in 10% of the population, that's 35% of several hundred million people in the U.S., that's a big number of people that we're still going to have to worry about getting COVID overtime. And the real question, it's going to be how well are those therapeutics? And our hope is that we get great therapeutics and that we can keep everybody out of the hospital and from dying, but we just don't know yet. If it ends up there, it will be more point-of-care. I think that we're going to end up doing PCR testing for quite some time at some level.\nMatt Larew: And then just on the drug development side, as you look to create differentiation there. Obviously, there were two capability additions you made back in October with Snap and Global Care. Maybe just give us a sense for where you look to continue to create differentiation and how maybe to measure the success of some of these capability additions, if not through revenue as perhaps the through win rates or broader business?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So to me the differentiation is having diagnostic capabilities, including companion diagnostics with drug development. The ability to do virtual in hypercritical trials, I think, everybody is going to have to do that, and you have to do it extraordinarily well. But the difference that we have versus others is our companion diagnostics and our diagnostic capabilities. And you've seen it with COVID. I believe you're going to see it with oncology and then in other therapeutic areas as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Congrats on the quarter and the good guidance for 2021. I guess just a couple of questions. On the CRO side, would you be able to give us kind of, like a balance of the bookings across preclinical, central lab and clinical? Because obviously, that's pretty good growth you've shown on the bookings number for Q4?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So we don't break it out necessarily by the individual areas. What I would say is that we've shown strength across all three of the therapeutic areas. If you look historically, we have real strength in early clinical development. We're a leader there. We have strength in our central laboratories. We're a leader there where we're continuing to progress and where we want to grow more substantially moving forward, is in the clinical trials, in particular, late-stage III clinical trials. So you are going to see us continue to have a major focus to win more in that area as we move forward. And I would expect overtime that we would disproportionately grow from that area.\nBrian Tanquilut: And then, Glenn, I guess, just a quick question on working capital for the quarter. It was probably a little - there was a drag that we saw in Q4. Is that going to normalize in 2021? Or how should we be thinking about working capital trends?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. When you look at the fact that our guidance range for earnings is kind of flat to slightly down, but our free cash flow is kind of flat to slightly up, if you will, from a year ago. It's really from working capital. So to your point, we've used cash from working capital to support the strong growth that we had as that growth rate that tempers as the PCR or call it, the COVID testing comes down, we expect to monetize the cash from that working capital buildup. And then obviously, partially offsetting that, we do expect to see a higher level of our cash spend for capital expenditures and 2021 that we kind of held back a little bit in 2020 as we were obviously dealing through the pandemic.\nAdam Schechter: So we're going to try to get through two last questions as fast as we possibly can in respect of everybody's time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Thank you for squeezing me in. Can we talk a little bit about oncology testing trends and NIPT and consumer genomics. Can we talk about where those expectations are and sort of the esoteric testing businesses there and how they're picking up and sort of where you're exiting the year?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So if you look at the esoteric testing, that declined the least amount, frankly, as we began with the pandemic, and it's recovered the best, about the same, frankly, as our base business now. So it's still down a bit versus prior year, but nowhere near what it was down in March. In March, obviously, it was down less than our core business was I have no doubt that oncology testing is going to continue to be important. And as we think about things like liquid biopsy, I think that's going to be increasingly important in the future. So I was glad that we're part of that market now with our non-small cell lung cancer capabilities, and we're going to continue to look for opportunities to be involved in that moving forward.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. And if I can do one follow-up. We - there's - LabCorp has a very long history of doing more technology-focused acquisitions. And given sort of the expansion of at home and clinic care testing, do you have any desire to sort of become an equipment manufacturer or equipment provider as opposed to just a testing lab?\nAdam Schechter: So as I've said before, when we look at our capital allocation. First and foremost, we want to do additional laboratory acquisitions. But then I would say we want to look at our strategic pillars. And if we see something, for example, in oncology that makes sense that would be our next area that we would go for acquisitions. At this moment, we're not looking at equipment and paying equipment makers. But I can tell you, we are looking at other areas to kind of enhance our core focused strategic areas.\nDerik De Bruin: Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Okay last question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.\nDonald Hooker: All right. I made it in barely at the end. Those will be it. So I guess your relationships with some of the big managed care companies were probably fairly distracted, particularly the UNH relationship, preferred the PLN. Would it be fair for us to assume there's maybe some pent-up momentum with UnitedHealth and some of the big managed care companies as COVID went down, the distraction stayed away or are they going to kind of step up their - revisit their strategies, maybe more earnestly to kind of drive volumes to the more efficient labs like LabCorp and others?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Don, I think that's an important point. And we have a great relationship with UnitedHealthcare. We have great relationships with the managed care organizations across the country. And I do believe that as things go back to kind of more of a normal scenario, though I don't think it will ever be completely normal what we had in the past. I do think there will be opportunities for us to work with them closer. So for example, on the PLN, the Preferred Laboratory Network, I would have thought we'd make more progress together. But with the distraction of COVID, it's been nearly impossible to do that. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to get back to that when things normalize a bit.\nDonald Hooker: Okay, great. I'll leave it there and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end.\nAdam Schechter: Terrific. Thank you. So the last thing I wanted to say is, first of all, thank you for joining us. And there's no doubt that we achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. But the beginning of the pandemic, we've been focused on what we can do to help as best we can. And I think our agility, our ability to move quickly combined with our science, innovation and technology is what has really differentiated us. And what we learned about agility and we've equity in the marketplace is here to stay. And I think that's going to continue to serve us well as we go into the future. So thanks for your time today. We look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before I cover 2020 results, I want to first thank Clarissa for her leadership in Investor Relations for the last several years. Clarissa has been promoted to lead our revenue cycle management team, which is a very important role. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Chas Cook, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations, and will continue to strengthen the foundation built upon by the IR team. Chad has been a strong leader in our finance organization since he joined LabCorp in 2018. Moving now to 2020 results. 2020 will be remembered for many things, including the fight against COVID and the tragic loss that it brought. It also emphasizes the critical importance of frontline healthcare workers and scientists, amongst others. Hi, Jack. Good morning and thanks for the question. The reason we had to give such a wide range, minus 35% to minus 50% for the testing is because, as you say, it's very difficult to have precision. And you could get to the minus 35% to minus 50% in several different ways. Right now, we've seen a decline in tests, if you look at the last several weeks versus the end of 2020. If that decline continued, and then you saw it continue throughout the whole year, you could get there. If the amount of testing we're doing today, on average, was maintained for the six months of this year - in the first six months, well, then you could do zero for the second half of the year and still be there. So there are multiple different ways to get there. My assumption going in is that the price is going to remain at where it is right now. So right now, it's $100. We're still in the emergency situation. That's been extended through the year. You have to hit the CMS guidelines, which is basically for the previous month. You have to have more than 50% at a two-day turnaround. And then they look at each sample for the current month. We're well within that range. I mean right now, we did 275,000 tests a day. We're not doing anywhere near that in our turnaround times about a day. So, I expect that the price you should assume is still about what we've averaged until now. I think for this quarter, it was about $90 on average. It then comes down to the volume. And I assume that the volume is going to continue to decline, albeit maybe at a lower rate than we saw from the end of last year into this year. And then for the second half of the year, they'll be significantly less than the first half of this year. That's our base case assumption. Yes. So right now, we're doing a couple of thousand sequences a week for the CDC. We can increase that significantly. We're working with them to see what numbers they might like us to go to. That's more science and more for the benefit of understanding the mutations. We could use it for drug development and understand what we need to do in the future with drug development. But I wouldn't look at that as a separate, significant revenue stream. Sure. So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having diagnostic and drug development together, is a winning scenario. And that you can do significantly better with drug development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no doubt in my mind that we've seen that with COVID. I mean, being able to do the diagnostic test of what we're doing drug development, enable us to win more than 400 opportunities across COVID. At the same time, I believe that people now have seen it in pharma and biotech. So it opens up the doors for other areas. We won large Pharmas oncology business. I think oncology is the next area that we'll be able to show the benefit of having diagnostic capabilities, particularly Companion Diagnostic capabilities along with drug development. And we are beginning to see in the biotech and pharma clients that this is mattering more and more. So I continue to be very bullish about the ability to have both these businesses together. I've always said that, I think that the drug development business benefits more by having diagnostic capabilities than diagnostics does by having drug development. But with that said, we've seen some synergies going the other way, where the drug development group has been working on Companion Diagnostics, and we're able to potentially launch that in the diagnostic area. So I'm actually seeing benefit to diagnostics over time from drug development. So we continue to make progress there. If you look at virtual and hybrid trials, the reason we've invested there is because I believe it's going to be more important than it's been in the past. And it's been talked about for quite some time. I don't think a lot of pharma companies were willing to go there because they know how to do the other trials, and we still have to get regulators to approve how to look at virtual hybrid trials. But with COVID, all that has changed. And \u2013 there are still about 20% to 30% of clinical sites that are not open. And if you start a trial now, you want to make sure if there's another event that, for example, if in November, there's a new variant and you need another vaccine. There could be another impact from COVID later this year. You don't want your trials to be interrupted. You want to have the possibility to do virtual and hybrid trials. So I think it's going to serve, number one, as a backup to, ensure that trials can continue. Number two, I believe that, particularly in specialty areas, you're going to see more and more use of the hybrid trials. Because what we're seeing is they can work and they can work well, and they can actually allow you to potentially enroll more patients faster. And therefore, I think it's here to stay now that we've seen it work. That's an important question. It's a very important scientific question. We are very specific to say, COVID testing and not break apart PCR and serology because it could go in multiple different directions. I think if you end up having to have a vaccine every year, serology might not be that important. If you need a vaccine every several years, then I believe serology will be very important. And the real question is going to be, what level, what's the quantitative analysis that you need for a certain level of antibodies to feel like you're protected. If there is a quantitative number, that people can feel comfortable they can fly, they can go to events, that they can do many other things, then it will be very important. And what we're doing is we're preparing for that just in case. So we already have the ability to do a semi quantitative antibody test, which I think would help if you have to get to a certain level, know what that level is. And we're going to be prepared to scale that. We already have - we can run thousands, but I want to be prepared in case we need hundreds of thousands in the future. It's just too early to know from the science, and we're learning so much about the variance and so forth, that there'll be more to come as we go through this year. Yes. So as I look at capital deployment, the first thing we look forward to see if there are hospital laboratories, local or regional laboratories that we can acquire. And those make a lot of sense. They are accretive in the first year, typically, you return your cost of capital in about two years, and we know how to integrate those. We are seeing more opportunities for those. We're spending a lot more time and discussions with various hospitals and local laboratories. And I can tell you, even as a senior management team, we're spending a lot more time in those discussions ourselves. So I feel good that there will be multiple opportunities as we go through this year. The second thing I look for is strategic acquisitions. So if there's something in one of the pillars of our strategy, for example, oncology, that we need to acquire in order to be successful, we would look to do something like that. And those would be kind of smaller tuck-in type of acquisitions versus large-scale mega deals. And then the third thing we look at is the share buybacks. If you ask me about large-scale acquisitions, so for example, another large CRO, I don't think we need to do that. I think we have what we need to be successful. So we're mostly interested in laboratory, hospital laboratories, local retail laboratories and strategic acquisitions helping us in the pillars. Yes. So average price is about $90. And of course, we're happy discussion with managed care. But as the volume has gone down significantly, and we see the testing not where it was, say, back in December, those discussions continue to happen, but I think we have a very strong rationale based upon the CMS price and guidance. Yes. Again, Eric, it's where you looking at it relative to the range. So part of the supplemental information that we provided, we actually did give, call it compound growth rates for the businesses based on the Base Business and COVID testing to kind of frame the growth. To your point, within that, obviously, there is some M&A and currency that impacts the numbers. But as we think about, again, the volume for Diagnostics, depending where you are in the range, at some point, we're going to cross over to being favorable volume. And so again, at the midpoint of the range, just assume that's relatively midpoint of the year. After that point, we're then looking at getting back to more historical growth rates. But even there, the trajectory of the recovery could be stronger. It could be a little softer. But overall, we do expect to see, depending on where you are from the range to - for the full year, we could be still below on volume for the full year, but favorable on price/mix. Or at the upper end of the range, we can be both favorable on volume as well as favorable on price for the full year. So again, just a very degree of how fast the recovery will come and how much it accelerates. Yes. So when you look at the guidance that we provide for, call it, for both of our businesses. The M&A that's associated in our guidance range is all deals that have been done in the past. So you're just getting the annualization part of that growth, if you will. In our enterprise numbers, we do assume that part of our capital allocation will go to M&A. So we reflect some of that growth in revenue at the enterprise level for that. But if you think about just the level of M&A in the quarter that we had, for Diagnostics was 0.9%. So obviously, we'll look to see that number be a smaller piece within the guidance range that we had for 2021, subject to any deals that we do would be additive to that. No. I think the deals are going to continue to be at least at the same pace in Paseo. In fact, I think there might be some acceleration based upon the number of discussions that we're having. And I think there's a couple of reasons why one is, for example, hospitals have realized how capital-intensive this business is. So many hospitals had to update their labs to be able to do COVID testing at any scale. And as they start to look at keeping those labs updated outside of COVID, they realize they probably need to do some additional upgrading to the equipment. So they'd rather use that capital for example, for a new surgery suite versus us having to just update the lab to run the test that they've done in the past. The second thing is that even though COVID has been significant, many of the hospitals haven't had their base business back to the level that we've seen, and they don't have the COVID testing ability that we have. So the COVID testing has not necessarily offset the other base business issues that they face. So I feel pretty good about deals this year, and I don't think it will slow down. If anything, I think it will be the same or accelerate. So we do testing in Canada. We also have the capacity to do some testing in the U.K. because we have a lab there that has the equipment. Outside of that, we don't necessarily do testing in any other country. The U.S. is obviously where we do the vast, vast majority of the testing. What I'd worry about with other countries has turned around time. Would it be easy to get the samples to the U.S. and turn those around fast enough. And then the ability to move equipment or have equipment in those other parts of the world, I don't think is necessarily that feasible. So the good news is that there are many additional alternatives that are coming to market. And I think that most countries right now have learned how to use the testing they have. In some countries don't use nearly as much testing as the U.S. So for example, in Japan, they do significantly less testing even though they have the capacity that they could do more if they chose to. So I think it really is country-by-country based on how they approach it. And it's not in our plan to expand outside of where we currently are for testing. Yes. Thank you, Adam. And again, the reason we gave such wide guidance of minus 35% to minus $50, because there's still so many unknowns. For back to work, back-to-school, we've been a big part of that. But many companies have not gone back to work yet, and you see more and more companies saying that they might not go back to work in the ways that they've done it in the past. Some of the companies that we're working with were actually using point-of-care testing to help them get up and running. Some were using our Pixel by LabCorp at home tests where they can send them to employees, particularly if they have large sales forces across the country. It's a very easy way for them to do it. So our LabCorp employee services, is very busy with back to work and back-to-school. And it really is just a matter of how many of those tests do you do while you're also vaccinating people. And then at the end of the day, frankly, it's going to come down to in the fall, where there'll be another strain, and will there be another outbreak will be a big flu season, and everybody has flu, you're going to want a test for both COVID and for flu. So, I do believe that there's opportunity in the second half of the year potentially, it's just too hard to know right now, and that's why we gave you such a wide range of possibilities. Yes. So I think if you look at the different parts. So for example, Central Laboratory work, we've been very busy, but we would probably fill that with other potential opportunities. So to me, it's kind of we're building capacity. We're doing both COVID and non-COVID Central Laboratory work, and we're very busy in Central Laboratories, as you can imagine. In terms of the trials, again, we're doing mostly non-COVID trials, clinical trials, but we're also doing some COVID clinical trials. I think the best way for you to kind of engage it is to know that the trials were 12% of our net orders over the last three quarters. That should give you the best sense of what that's going to look like over time. I don't think it's going to slow down a lot this year. I think there's going to be more work that you're going to need for variance for vaccines, for example. There's still a lot of anti-virals that are being studied. So I do think for this year, you're going to still see significant work for Covance. And then we'll have to see where it ends up as we go to next year. Yes, Ricky, it's a very important question. We have that discussion often amongst ourselves. I believe that because people are not going to their doctor as often as they have, where they may have missed their wellness programs that when the doctors are seeing the patients who are just trying to get as many tests on as they can to make sure they can treat that patient appropriately. I do not personally believe it's going to be a long-term sustainable number of tests per acquisition. I think we'll get back to closer to where it was. But we're also trying to understand the difference between telemedicine and doctor visits. And if there's a difference there, we don't think there is, but we're still trying to understand that. So our base case assumes that as the business comes back and starts to grow again, that it's not based upon increasing numbers of tests per acquisition. It's based upon more people going to their physicians. You know, Ricky, I think that, first of all, telemedicine has been very important as we've gone through the pandemic. I think that there have been some restrictions that have lifted that will probably stay lifted in terms of being able to do things over state lines and so forth. And I think it's going to be important to understand it more as we move forward. The good news for LabCorp is that we're involved with almost every major telemedicine company. So if they can easily access the ability to get testing done for patients. And we have so many service centers across the country, including the ones through Walgreens that I believe that we're easily accessible to patients, whether it's in their physicians' offices or through telemedicine. But I do believe it's here to stay, and a - that we're part of it and we're able to make it an easy transition through their EMRS. Yes. Hi, Matt. I think it's going to depend on the treatments that we have available and the anti-virals and how effective they are. If at the end of the day, you're diagnosed with COVID in the future, but we know you're not going to end up in a hospital, you're going to die because we have great ways to treat it, then I think it could become point-of-care testing like flu. If it's as serious as it is today, where people aren't vaccinated, they could end up in a hospital to end of time then I think it's going to end up PCR testing, particularly for people with symptoms. Because we do know that the point-of-care testing is not necessarily as accurate, and you do miss some people through that. I don't think you're going to want to miss people if they can end up in a hospital die. So I think it's really going to it takes some time for us to understand how good the therapeutics work outside of vaccinations. Because when you think about it, if 20% or 25% of the population doesn't get vaccinated, and if the vaccine doesn't work in 10% of the population, that's 35% of several hundred million people in the U.S., that's a big number of people that we're still going to have to worry about getting COVID overtime. And the real question, it's going to be how well are those therapeutics? And our hope is that we get great therapeutics and that we can keep everybody out of the hospital and from dying, but we just don't know yet. If it ends up there, it will be more point-of-care. I think that we're going to end up doing PCR testing for quite some time at some level. Yes. So to me the differentiation is having diagnostic capabilities, including companion diagnostics with drug development. The ability to do virtual in hypercritical trials, I think, everybody is going to have to do that, and you have to do it extraordinarily well. But the difference that we have versus others is our companion diagnostics and our diagnostic capabilities. And you've seen it with COVID. I believe you're going to see it with oncology and then in other therapeutic areas as well. Yes. So we don't break it out necessarily by the individual areas. What I would say is that we've shown strength across all three of the therapeutic areas. If you look historically, we have real strength in early clinical development. We're a leader there. We have strength in our central laboratories. We're a leader there where we're continuing to progress and where we want to grow more substantially moving forward, is in the clinical trials, in particular, late-stage III clinical trials. So you are going to see us continue to have a major focus to win more in that area as we move forward. And I would expect overtime that we would disproportionately grow from that area. So we're going to try to get through two last questions as fast as we possibly can in respect of everybody's time. Yes. So if you look at the esoteric testing, that declined the least amount, frankly, as we began with the pandemic, and it's recovered the best, about the same, frankly, as our base business now. So it's still down a bit versus prior year, but nowhere near what it was down in March. In March, obviously, it was down less than our core business was I have no doubt that oncology testing is going to continue to be important. And as we think about things like liquid biopsy, I think that's going to be increasingly important in the future. So I was glad that we're part of that market now with our non-small cell lung cancer capabilities, and we're going to continue to look for opportunities to be involved in that moving forward. So as I've said before, when we look at our capital allocation. First and foremost, we want to do additional laboratory acquisitions. But then I would say we want to look at our strategic pillars. And if we see something, for example, in oncology that makes sense that would be our next area that we would go for acquisitions. At this moment, we're not looking at equipment and paying equipment makers. But I can tell you, we are looking at other areas to kind of enhance our core focused strategic areas. Okay last question. Yes. Don, I think that's an important point. And we have a great relationship with UnitedHealthcare. We have great relationships with the managed care organizations across the country. And I do believe that as things go back to kind of more of a normal scenario, though I don't think it will ever be completely normal what we had in the past. I do think there will be opportunities for us to work with them closer. So for example, on the PLN, the Preferred Laboratory Network, I would have thought we'd make more progress together. But with the distraction of COVID, it's been nearly impossible to do that. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to get back to that when things normalize a bit. Terrific. Thank you. So the last thing I wanted to say is, first of all, thank you for joining us. And there's no doubt that we achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. But the beginning of the pandemic, we've been focused on what we can do to help as best we can. And I think our agility, our ability to move quickly combined with our science, innovation and technology is what has really differentiated us. And what we learned about agility and we've equity in the marketplace is here to stay. And I think that's going to continue to serve us well as we go into the future. So thanks for your time today. We look forward to talking to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2021 guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, an increase of 52% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 50.1%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 46.4% and organic base business growth of 3.7%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 0.6%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or 28.8% of revenue compared to $336 million or 11.4% last year. During the quarter, we had $46 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $91 million of amortization, which was higher than recent quarters. As part of our new branding initiative, we are transitioning out of the Covance trading. As a result, we are accelerating the amortization of its trade name over the next year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 31.8% of revenue compared to $422 million or 14.3% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by PAMA, higher personnel costs and investments to support the company's new branding initiative. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% compared to 22.4% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.8% compared to 22.9% last year. The higher adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For modeling purposes, we expect the company's adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be comparable to 2020 at approximately 25%. This does not include any potential increase in the federal tax rate in 2021. Net earnings for the quarter were $938 million or $9.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items were $10.56 in the quarter, up from $2.86 last year. Operating cash flow was $775 million in the quarter, compared to $570 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital to support growth. The higher working capital was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivables and supplies related to COVID testing. And Jack, just to reinforce it, too, one of the reasons we did break out the level of COVID testing separate from our Base Business, just given that we put a wider range around something that we feel is more uncertain versus, frankly, having better visibility on just the performance of our Base Business. Yes, Jack. As you saw from a revenue standpoint, what was nice is that we saw the 0.5% growth in revenues in the quarter. So it's the first time we've seen the positive to your point, it's a combination that we still saw lower volumes down 7.7%, but still that's an improvement as we trended through the earlier parts of the year. And it was more than offset by favorable price/mix and we continue to see an unusually high level of favorable mix, primarily driven by higher test prerecession. So the feeling is with the fewer visits that patients are going, they're conducting more tests per visit that they're going through. So again, as we think going forward and reflected in the guidance is we'll continue to see over time, the pickup in our base volumes. But with that, you'll see the core level core lever, if you will. You'll start to see that favorable mix start to come back down to more historical levels. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So first thing is, if you look at the drug development business which is 16%, but if you take out the PCR testing, we had growth of 8.4% which was strong growth and we did well across all of our businesses. If you look at COVID right now, basically, the COVID trials accounted for about 12% of our net orders, if you look at the last 3 quarters. So you can see that it's meaningful, but a lot of our growth is coming from outside of COVID trials. And we mentioned in the last quarter that we won a large pharma's oncology book of business. I think that's helpful to us, but also we've won another pharma's non-oncology business. So we continue to show strength outside of COVID, which is very important as we move forward to the base business. That's what gives us confidence as we look at the range we provided for the drug development business for this year. Erin, the only other thing I'd add for that is that, as Adam said, COVID testing the guidance that we gave down under the $35 million to $50 million is our expectation for the full year. But while serology is a small piece of that, frankly, from our guidance in the range that we have, we would actually have a range where serology testing would go up at the upper end of the range, could go down again at the lower end of the range, versus the PCRs, to your point, is once the vaccines are readily available, more interest in seeing if the antibodies are there. But again, it's a smaller piece of the total COVID business that we have. Yes, Ralph. Yeah. From our perspective, it's kind of an interesting viewpoint because as we go into 2021 and look at a comp to 2020, obviously, we see significant growth in both - in our base businesses because it's coming off of the pandemic here. As we look back to 2019 kind of pre pandemic levels, to your point, your growth rates, we actually look at it even on a compound growth rate, let's say, is that kind of fitting in within our historical growth rates. And the guidance range that we have kind of implies, obviously, we're getting a range. But for both businesses, clearly at the upper end of the range that we're back to kind of the normal historical growth. And so as we think about the pieces, so first, within diagnostics, while we've already seen a favorable revenue trend in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, so revenue is already there, but our volume wasn't. We were down, call it, around 8% in the fourth quarter. So the range that we have as we look to 2019 is that, for the most part, call it, the mid part of the guidance that the volume now will get back to 2019 levels, call it, in the midyear to second half of the year. And again, the price will come down to more historical levels as well. But similarly, within the drug development side of the business, we've already had good growth compared to a year ago, and we expect that to continue relative to 2019 levels, where, again, the range, if you looked at it as a CAGR to 2019 similarly, within the range, gets us back to our historical growth rates, again, depending where you are in the range. So with the recognition that there's still going to be some softness in the base business that's expected in the first half of 2021 because of the pandemic still here the vaccine not broadly available. But clearly, with the second half of the year expectations, we're now growing relative to 2019 at a more historical level. Yes. So if you look at the growth that we had for the fourth quarter, it was very strong. It was about 8.4% if you take out the PCR testing. And its strength is coming from all three businesses. It's coming from the early stage, the central laboratory as well as the clinical development business. As we look at the COVID trials and what they accounted for, it was about 12% of our net orders across the last three quarters. So you can see that it's meaningful, but it's not that much. We still would have had great growth even without the COVID trials in terms of our net orders. No. Eugene, what we've said is that that we expect to target the free cash flow that we generate this year to both M&A and the buybacks. So assume that we will be in the market each quarter within buybacks, but the level of buybacks will be, as Adam commented earlier, driven off of the amount of acquisitions we do. And we have a good pipeline of deals. But like in most years, or at least most normal years, always expect it to be - they're not mutually exclusive that we expect to continue to do, strategic M&A acquisitions as well as repurchasing shares with our excess cash flow. But we've not quantified the amount, but obviously, it would be within a range of our guidance. Yes. So Ricky, the - as we talked about just thinking about it as organic core volume for us. We were down 7.7%. So we saw a good trend throughout the year. As you'll recall, we ended the third quarter - call it 8.9%, but the end of the quarter was more like an 8% number. So we have seen that the base volumes have stabilized. We've seen that throughout the quarter. And frankly, we've seen it also into January of this year. Obviously, we're going to start to see the favorable comps as we compare against a pandemic year in 2020. But again, as we talked about earlier, when we look at the range of guidance we gave for the business, depending upon where we are in the range of guidance that we do expect to see, call it midyear into the second half of the year as the midpoint of the guidance that you should see the organic volumes be picking up relative to 2019 levels. Yes. When you look at the fact that our guidance range for earnings is kind of flat to slightly down, but our free cash flow is kind of flat to slightly up, if you will, from a year ago. It's really from working capital. So to your point, we've used cash from working capital to support the strong growth that we had as that growth rate that tempers as the PCR or call it, the COVID testing comes down, we expect to monetize the cash from that working capital buildup. And then obviously, partially offsetting that, we do expect to see a higher level of our cash spend for capital expenditures and 2021 that we kind of held back a little bit in 2020 as we were obviously dealing through the pandemic."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Clarissa Willett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nClarissa Willett: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to LabCorp's Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We delivered strong results in the third quarter as our base business continued to recover and significant progress was achieved to fight the global pandemic. Clinical trial activity is improving and we've had important wins in both COVID and non-COVID-related clinical trials. The Diagnostics business has recovered well as people resume their routine preventive visits, actively care for their chronic conditions and move ahead with elective surgeries and other procedures. Non-COVID-related volume was down approximately 9% for the quarter. As a result, we reported growth in the third quarter versus the prior year with revenue of $3.9 billion, adjusted EPS of $8.41 and free cash flow of $709 million. Throughout the year, our COVID-19 testing has helped to offset the pressure experienced in our base business. This is the first quarter where both the Diagnostics and Drug Development total businesses grew versus prior year. Based on the current and expected strength of our business, we have decided to return the CARES Act Provider Relief Funds. We greatly appreciate the support that CARES Act funding afforded us in the early days of the pandemic when our base business was significantly impacted and the future was uncertain. We are pleased we can take this action now. Glenn will expand on this in a few moments. Importantly, our strategy extends beyond COVID-19. What LabCorp did prior to the pandemic and what we will do after the pandemic remains important to the country and to the world. Our strategy is based on the following long-term priorities: first, leveraging the power of our combined capabilities across Diagnostics and Drug Development; second, advancing our leadership position in oncology; third, integrating AI, data, digitalization and analytics across our business; fourth, putting customers at the center of all that we do; and finally, we will continue to evaluate and execute on high growth opportunities.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and end with some comments on our outlook. For third quarter results, we have quantified the revenue associated with the COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests, so that you can see the change in the base business. Also during the quarter, we received $76 million in CARES Act Provider Relief Funding, which is excluded from earnings but included in cash flow. As Adam mentioned, we decided to return the funds in the fourth quarter, as well as the $56 million of funds we received in the second quarter. As a result, we have reversed the $56 million CARES Act funds from our earnings in the third quarter. \nOperator: . Our first question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. \nJack Meehan: I wanted to start by asking about the base business recovery. It was coming in stronger than we were expecting. Is there any color you can provide around just month-by-month trend throughout the quarter? And then, Glenn, also, if I look at how the base business, you saw the negative impact on volume, but positive on rev rec. Just help us maybe from a test category perspective, what you're seeing as well there.\nAdam Schechter: Jack, this is Adam. I'll start with the recovery of the base business. I said it before that, it surprised me how fast the base business has recovered. If you go back to March, our base business at that point was down 55% versus the prior year. And this is looking at Diagnostics. If you then would look at June, our base business was down about 17% for the month of June. But for the quarter, second quarter, it was down 35%. If you look at third quarter, which we've just discussed, we're down 9% for the quarter. So you are seeing sequential improvements quarter-over-quarter. And frankly, we're seeing it month-over-month. So each month is a little bit better than the prior month. So we continue to see that coming back.  With regard to our other business, our Drug Development business, that's coming back a bit slower, not as quickly as the Diagnostic business. What we've seen is the preclinical, early stage work has come back the fastest of the 3 businesses in Drug Development. Last quarter, the central laboratory business was not coming back as quickly as the clinical development business. For this quarter, we've seen a significant acceleration in our central laboratory business and that has actually come back a bit faster than the clinical development business. With the clinical development business, we have access to about 70% of the sites now. So that's better than last quarter, but there's still about 30% of the sites that are not open for access at the moment.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Jack, this is Glenn. Just to your other question on kind of the volume being down, but the favorable price/mix being up and Adam, obviously, just went through the volume decline. On the price/mix, as you know, in kind of a normal environment. Diagnostics overall does kind of the 1% to 2% organic volume and then we pick up around a point on favorable price/mix. And obviously, the last couple of quarters are anything but in a normal environment. We have seen favorable price/mix over the last two quarters. We were up around 5% last quarter and now up around 7% this quarter. The biggest driving factor to the improvement in price/mix really has been an increase in our test per session. We've also seen an improvement in the mix. And to your point, some categories, in particular, like women's health or NIPT or hepatitis screening seem to be the bigger test parts that we've seen a higher growth rate than the other. But overall, a favorable mix, but again, the biggest driver being the amount of tests we're doing per session.\nJack Meehan: Great. And just as a follow-up on COVID testing. Could you share your thoughts around the sustainability of the rate you're collecting per detection test? And kind of building off that, your incremental margins in Diagnostics were obviously very strong this quarter. Should we expect that rate to sustain as we go into the fourth quarter? And any thoughts around the durability there would be great.\nAdam Schechter: Jack, so when we launched the PCR testing, we had three core principles. The first one was to use science and innovation and build as much capacity as quickly as we could. The second was that everybody would have equal access to the testing. So we charge nobody upfront out-of-pocket cost and we charge everybody the Medicare rate. In fact, when we first launched the test, we launched it before we even knew what the Medicare rate was. And then the third thing was that nobody would be prioritized over anybody else. That as the test came into laboratories, we would do those tests first, with the only exception was when the CDC and HHS asked us to prioritize, so for example, for a hospital inpatients. And I think that those principles have served us well. And we adhere to those principles as we sit here today.  In terms of the longevity, I think for as long as the emergency declaration is here, which now is through the month of January and we'll see if it gets extended after that, I think that the pricing is consistent. You saw recently that there was a slight change to Medicare, where it still will be reimbursed for people up to $100, if your turnaround time is within 2 days. And the good news is our turnaround time is about a day. So that shouldn't have a significant impact on us for that Medicare change. And then we have to see what happens over time with the declaration of the emergency after the end of January next year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: During the quarter, a lot of COVID revenues flow through to the bottom line. I understand you aren't giving guidance but can you walk us through any new costs that we could see during the fourth quarter? Or if you're considering taking the excess earnings from COVID and accelerating any investments in the near term.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Go ahead, Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Just a comment for the guidance. It's less of, call it, an issue on the cost. It's more just the significant variance in potential outcomes relative to the business demand. So obviously, we've seen in the third quarter, as Adam and I commented in our remarks, the business is performing well sequentially, ending the quarter even better than where we started. So obviously, at the current run rates, we would expect to see continued good results.  As we enter into the fall, again, the flu season, we just don't know the restrictions that may be in place, what the impact of the base businesses will be going forward. So really, the uncertainty being driven more off of what's the demand of the business, could be continued strength, could be some softness, if we see a pretty bad flu season ahead of us. But overall, the cost structure of the company is in place. And frankly, one of the benefits to the margin improvement is being able to leverage that cost control, while we're seeing enhanced revenues.\nAdam Schechter: And just to give you a little additional context. A couple of weeks ago, we were averaging about 110,000 PCR tests a day. Now we're averaging 120,000 PCR tests a day. We could go up to over 200,000 a day if the country needed it during the flu season. If you look at Australia, Brazil, Argentina and some other countries that have gone through the flu season, it hasn't been particularly a big flu season. In fact, it was very small in those countries. Could it be because they were in lockdown for COVID? That would help with the flu season? Yes, very possibly. So without knowing what the flu season could bring and we're just right at the start of it, you could see how much variability there could be.\nPhilip Chickering: Okay. Then as a follow-up, for share repurchases, historically, you've been fairly measured on your quarterly repurchases. Should we expect a similar activity going forward or because of a recent influx of cash flows could it be more accelerated?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Well, so we've always looked at our capital allocation very carefully and thoughtfully. And our first and foremost thing that we look to do is to buy these tuck-in acquisitions, these local laboratories, local hospital laboratories where we can bring them into our business, very quickly they become accretive. They return their cost of capital within a very short period of time and we know how to integrate them. There are several of those that we're looking at. I can tell you, I believe that there has been an acceleration in the number of those possibilities as we go through this year into next year. And we'll look at capital allocation from that lens first and then we'll be opportunistic where it makes sense with the share repurchases.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Erin Wright of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nErin Wilson: Great. On the Covance side of the business, you mentioned 13% of bookings associated with COVID. How should we be thinking about the COVID-related bookings across Covance more meaningfully contributing to top line growth? And then how much is vaccine work compared to therapeutic COVID clinical trials?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Erin. So we're making significant progress with COVID on both the diagnostic and in the clinical trial business. Many of the studies -- said that we've done about 300 -- we've won about 350 of those opportunities. Many of them are very early stage, smaller trials, where we're doing in the preclinical work or we're doing design work and those types of things. And then there are others that are late-stage in the vaccine space where we're actively involved at the moment. They are not materially impacting the revenue at the moment. So that's why we didn't call out revenue specifically. But as we go through time, they'll become more meaningful for us.  In terms of vaccine versus the other types of treatments, there's less vaccines out there, but the vaccine trials are much, much bigger than the other trials. So I would say in numbers of trials, most of them are outside of vaccines. But when you look at volume, there's a lot of volume coming through the vaccines.\nErin Wilson: Okay. And then quickly on capital deployment. Again, I guess, how should we be thinking about your positioning as a consolidator in this market in a post-COVID world? Where are there more opportunities or less opportunities in and what does the acquisition pipeline look like?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll start with in the Diagnostic business. One of the things that I've said before that has surprised me since starting as the CEO here last November is that there are lots of opportunities and lots of discussions that occur about acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, but they just take a bit longer than I had expected. I thought that they make so much economic sense for both the laboratory that's looking to be acquired and for LabCorp that I thought they would go faster. So at the moment, there are many more that we're looking at today than what I would have said before, particularly if you look at the size and scale of some of them, but how fast they go is impossible for me to predict because they have, in the past, taken longer than I expected.  In terms of other acquisitions, we mentioned GlobalCare and snapIoT. Those were two acquisitions that would help us with decentralized clinical trials and hybrid trials. We've said that those were critical to our strategy and they were smaller tuck-in types of acquisitions to help with our strategy. So we'll continue to look for smaller tuck-in acquisitions that help us strategically. I do not see the need, as I sit here today, to do any type of very large scale acquisition. I think that we have what we need to be successful and we can augment it with smaller targeted strategic acquisitions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: What are you seeing in terms of the makeup of your base business mix? Is there any changes, if you were to call it out sort of on a year-over-year basis? How much has it changed in any way, shape or form? Or are you still seeing the same type of mix that you had prior?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Kevin, the mix is about the same. What's been interesting is in the beginning of the pandemic, when our base business was down significantly, our esoteric business did not fall as fast as our other business. Last quarter, we said that both businesses were coming back about equal. Now I would say in the third quarter, our base business actually came back a bit faster than the esoteric business. So we're not necessarily seeing a long-term mix shift but we've seen a different impact on the 2 businesses as we've gone through the year.\nKevin Caliendo: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, you said you were planning to add some capacity to your COVID testing. Can you take us through sort of what that might be? Is 210,000 -- is that where we should think about? And what is sort of the breaking point when you think about turnaround times in terms of how many tests you can do and still get it done within that 48-hour period?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So Kevin, as I mentioned, right now, we can do more than 210,000 tests per day. And our turnaround time today is about 1 day. Now right now, we're testing an average about 120,000 tests. And I would say we could go much higher and I still think maintain our current turnaround time or just be within the 48 hours. The 210,000 does not include our pooling that we're able to do. And if we needed to do more pooling, we could increase that pretty significantly. But also, we're looking at adding additional capacity in terms of machines and capabilities. So as we said from the beginning, one of our core tenets was to build capacity as quickly as we can. We've been doing that since March. In July, there was a significant increase in the number of samples that we were receiving. And no matter how fast we had built capacity, we still fell a little bit behind. So even though right now we're running at about 50% of our capacity, we are not slowing down. We're going to continue to buy the machines that we can buy. And to me, that's the biggest rate-limiting is the number of larger machines that we can get as we go into the fall flu season.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: Great. Adam, let me just start with the combination of the flu and PCR test. Can you just talk about -- will that count as a COVID test? Or will that count as a flu test when we think about volumes? And then secondly, how do we think about reimbursement for combined tests like that?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Absolutely, Lisa. So we are currently able to do the flu, PCR and also RSV test through physicians. We also notably filed an EUA to be able to do it with our Pixel and our LabCorp At Home test. I think that as we go into flu season, if somebody has a lot of symptoms, it might be nice that they not even have to go to a doctor. Their doctor can send them a test, so they can order a test and get the results. If you look at the Medicare rates, we believe it's going to be about $143 for the combined test. And as we've done in the past, we've used the Medicare rate as our guide as we've gone through the pandemic and the emergency declaration. So we'll continue to do that. With regard to how we record that, Lisa, I think we have to think that through. As we decide, we'll certainly make sure that we talk to you and let the external environment know how we're thinking about it. To date, so we've gotten very few because we're really not in the flu season yet. So there hasn't been a real need at the moment for the combined test.\nLisa Gill: And Adam, how do you think about testing when we do have a vaccine? What's your point of view around -- and I know you're not giving any guidance for fourth quarter or for 2021. But how do we start to think about testing as we have vaccines come into the market in 2021?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll give you my thoughts on it, but anybody that tells you that they have any significant degree of certainty is wrong. That's the only part I'm certain about, what I'm about to say. I believe that we'll have a lot more data by the end of this year to know the effectiveness of the various vaccines that are in Phase III. And that's going to be very helpful. And if we have vaccines that can move forward into the marketplace, I think it could start early next year. But before you could vaccinate a significant number of the population in U.S., I think you're probably talking about the middle of next year, my personal opinion, based upon experience without knowing all the facts. So I think that they're going to need continued testing for at least through the first quarter of next year for PCR testing. I think you're going to continue to need it as you go into the second part of the year. And then by the time you get to the summertime, hopefully, we'll have the vaccine broadly disseminated and the need for PCR testing will be significantly diminished. The two questions we have are: one, we know the pricing relatively certain what it could look like through January. We have to see what the pricing will look like after January. My assumption is that why wouldn't you continue to have the emergency authorization through the winter, but we just don't know that for sure. And then the second thing to realize with the vaccine is we don't know are there going to be antibody tests, titer tests, they're going to be neutralizing antibody tests that might be helpful as people go through the vaccine. So we're developing a suite of tests. We announced last week our test for the antibodies that we give you quantitative analysis used in pharmaceuticals, to try to help understand what might be helpful. So will there be additional tests that we can do to help in the future even after vaccine? My assumption is probably, but we still have to wait to see the data. Is it going to be T cells? Or is it going to be antibody? There's still a lot more we're going to learn over the coming months.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I just wanted to confirm a couple of things and maybe talk through these. First off, based on your disclosure on the 13% of awards from COVID tests -- clinical trials in the Covance segment, I'm coming up with net book-to-bills this quarter and last quarter of around 1.15 to 1.2. And that's if I also strip out the COVID-19 active infection testing revenue, which I think you're putting in one-for-one with bookings. Is that ballpark? Am I getting to the right numbers here?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Eric, I guess, just a question. Are you trying to back out the impact of the award...\nEric Coldwell: Yes. Trying to look at what the -- I think the -- yes, thanks. The big question, I think, everyone has is how much of the awards in the CRO side of the world are coming from COVID-19 trials. And then how much revenue, how much impact, what the comps are going to be down the road. So I'm trying to look at what the -- I hate to say base business because this is all what you do, but the core legacy non-COVID testing and then we also have to make an additional adjustment for the work that would have historically been done in LCD, but it's getting shifted over to Covance central labs. I know you're putting that revenue in at kind of a 1:1 on bookings. So I think if I strip everything out and look at the base, I'm still coming up with book-to-bills for the last two quarters of around 1.2.\nGlenn Eisenberg: I think the distinction, though, is that when you -- and Adam kind of commented. We have, obviously, a lot of awards that have come in, a lot of tending to be more on the early side of our business. So when you look at the book-to-bill that's coming in from, call it, the non-COVID testing, but the awards that we're getting for vaccine or therapeutics would be, call it, at a lower book-to-bill, if you will, than what we've been experiencing overall. So if anything, taking out a lower ratio of book-to-bill for at least the awards that we have, you could even argue, could move it somewhat the other way. I think for the businesses that are seeing more on the late-stage clinical trials for those awards, that tend to be longer book-to-bill time periods. You might see a different outcome than what we're currently experiencing.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. And then on Covance margin, getting a lot of inbound questions on what the core margin was if we strip out the COVID-19 testing. I'm coming up with something around 15% in the quarter, but I was hoping you could lend some color on that.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So let me give you some context. One of the things that I had mentioned before is when we saw the decline in our business in Covance, we did not reduce the size and the number of people that we had. And the reason why is a lot of these people are hard to find. They're hard to train. We thought -- and we're seeing the business coming back. So I'd be careful with the margins because the margins are a little bit worse than they typically would be because we're still seeing the revenue come back. But at the same time, we kept a bit of the expenses for the people so that we didn't have to try to rehire and refine people that we already had.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is that when you -- we've talked about that kind of the organic revenue growth was really the PCR testing. So we would have been flat otherwise. So organically, still a positive, call it, flat in the pandemic, flat organic revenue. So from a margin standpoint, plus or minus, assume that our margins, excluding the PCR testing, would be relatively flat as well. As Adam said, the headwind from, call it, the personnel side of it, but we also have kind of the tailwind from our LaunchPad initiative. In addition, we get some leverage from -- we talked about the currency conversion and some acquisitions that would be additive as well.\nEric Coldwell: Right. And when you say flat, I guess, I'm trying to understand what is it, flat with last quarter, flat with 2H, flat with last year? I am just trying to get a sense on what you're implying by flat.\nGlenn Eisenberg: The flat would be in explaining the change in our margins, where we're up around, call it, 200 basis points in margin. Assume that's being attributable to the PCR testing and that margins overall would be relatively flat with the explanation that both Adam and I gave for that.\nEric Coldwell: Right. So around -- you did 14.9% last year. I said around 15%. So that's correct?\nGlenn Eisenberg: That's relatively flat. Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Don Hooker with KeyBanc.\nDonald Hooker: Great. So maybe just two questions for me. Would love to hear kind of an update. We've hit a lot of issues already this morning, but maybe an update on the sort of managed care environment. On a different topic, kind of with the relationship with United, with other -- are those sort of at standstills? Are we seeing some movement there? I know there's a lot of disruption in the markets. We'd love to hear your updated thoughts on that.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. So we continue to have a very strong relationship with United. And we were pleased that we were put on to p.r.n. again in July of this year. Frankly, I thought at this time this year, I'll be able to give you an update on how the p.r.n. has worked since we entered into it about a year ago. And unfortunately, with the pandemic, we haven't seen a significant amount of progress, but we are continuing to be optimistic that it makes a lot of sense and we'll be able to work with United to get the p.r.n. up and running and to help them shift the business to where they want to shift it to, which is to the high-quality, lower cost laboratories like ourselves. And the PLN -- it's the PLN, Preferred Laboratory Network, is something that other managed care plans have begun to talk about those types of things. I believe that they -- we're waiting to see if it worked. And now that they've waited a while, even though we don't necessarily know if it works or not, I think we might see more of that as we move forward because everybody realizes the economic advantage of having these PLNs in place. And I think we'll see more and more of it as we go into the future. So stay tuned.\nDonald Hooker: Okay. Super. And then one last quick one. You guys -- I guess, the last question was on the COVID-19 testing at the Covance facilities. Does that have any kind of crowding out effect on the rest of Covance? Or is it -- are you not doing work that you otherwise would have done? Or is there any kind of crowding out from driving -- putting some of the COVID-19 testing activity at the Covance business?\nAdam Schechter: No. As I said before, we could do 210,000 tests a day. We're doing 120,000 tests. We're using that facility opportunistically. But if we had other things that we needed to do in that facility, we would obviously use other facilities to run the test. One of the good things that we did was to go and run our tests on multiple platforms. So we're running on 8 different platforms. But at the same time, we have a network across the United States that we can kind of have materials and samples sent to the laboratories that will have the best turnaround time. And we can use our network to say, let's send more samples to this laboratory, less to that one, more to this one and we can do it on a very routine basis. So we have the ability to flex where we need to flex.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut at Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Just a quick follow-up to Eric's question, flipping it to the core Diagnostics business. How are you thinking about margin sustainability once you ex out the COVID opportunity? I mean, obviously, very strong margins during the quarter. So just trying to figure out what you think core margins could be going forward.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Brian, I guess, similar. Obviously, the big driver in the margin improvement, as you pointed out, was the COVID testing. We actually did leverage well, even excluding COVID testing in Diagnostics. This business a little bit, kind of, the opposite on the Drug Development side. As Adam said, we have the personnel for the business that we have. So we have a little bit more of a headwind on Diagnostics because of the significant growth in the business. We continue to add personnel as we're going. So we -- from a personnel standpoint, we really leverage. So with the LaunchPad savings we had in the quarter, margins held up really well, even despite the negative impact of PAMA with the Diagnostics. But strong under, call it, the base business underlying the margins were -- came in very strong.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephen Baxter of Wolfe Research.\nStephen Baxter: I wanted to ask you about PCR reimbursement. So it's very helpful you provide the precise revenue and testing figures around COVID. So thank you for that. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what your average PCR reimbursement was in Q3 and how that compares to what you saw in Q2. When I look at your disclosures, I'm backing into something in the mid-90s for Q3, whereas for Q2, I was backing into something more like mid- to high-70s. So just wondering if there was anything in there related to true-up maybe as you got more confidence in your ability to collect on managed care. And an extension of that would just be how we should be thinking about PCR reimbursement in Q4.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Sure. So our reimbursement in this quarter was about the same as last quarter. It was in the mid-80s to upper 80s and that's been consistent. And as I mentioned before, with our three principles, the second principle is that we charge people the Medicare rate, which is $100. As we continue to be in the emergency declaration, which is through the first month of next year, I think the 22nd or something like that of January, I believe we'll continue to have good reimbursement. The question will be, will they continue the emergency declaration? If they do, I believe reimbursement will continue or if they don't, I think we'll have pressure on pricing without the emergency declaration. The other thing is you did see that Medicare is now still reimbursing for $100 per patient, but only if your turnaround time is two days. And you have to average two days for the month before and be two days brings with the test. The good news is that we're at about a 1 day turnaround time. So we feel pretty comfortable with that. But we'll continue as we go through the fall season and we see numbers increase, watch that extraordinarily closely.\nStephen Baxter: Got it. And just 1 somewhat related follow-up. Just on payer mix. Obviously, there's a ton going on with the pricing numbers at the moment. Just wondering if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of any payer mix shift or potentially increases in assumptions around like bad debt accruals and like?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. We're really not seeing any significant change in payer mix. It's pretty consistent as it's been in the past.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. I think that's the end on bad debt accruals.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, obviously, concerning economic trends across the country. Wondering if you're seeing any increase in bad debt.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Good. Yes, I just want to make sure I understood the question, right. Yes. From a bad debt standpoint, obviously, as you know, we reserved in the first quarter, $17 million. We have seen an increase in the bad debt, just given the financial strain that obviously is impacting some of our clients. We feel that the reserves that we've established are adequate, but there's no question we've seen a little bit of a pickup in the bad debt, but we feel our rate that we accrue for is very adequate relative to the expectations that we have for that going forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rivka Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.\nRivka Goldwasser: So Adam, I think earlier in response to a question, you sort of downplayed the role of serology testing once a vaccine is available. Do you think -- do you anticipate based just on historical context any guidelines around use of testing in conjunction with the COVID vaccine? And are you having any conversations with the biopharma company around that?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, absolutely, Ricky. And I still believe that the serology testing is going to be important in the future. I just don't think we have the science yet to tell us. Is it neutralizing antibodies, is it total antibodies, quantitative analysis, T cell involvement outside of antibodies. So my only comment was meant to say that there's a lot more science that needs to be done. If it really is, is it going to be an annual vaccine? Or is it going to be every couple of years? If it's more than every year, you'll need titers measured and those types of things. So I think there will be a role.  We're in conversations, I'd say, with most if not all the major pharma companies, conversations with operation more speed and conversations with many other science and thought leaders in this area. So we're building a whole series of potential ways to measure the impact of vaccines. I can't tell you which one is going to work. But I can tell you, if there is something, which historically there has been, we're going to do everything as we can to be ready for it.\nRivka Goldwasser: Okay. So just to clarify, because if we think of one of the questions we're getting is kind of like what are the drivers, right, in the second half of '21 and into '22 post-PCR? So to your point, there's going to be some sort of testing that's going to replace PCR? Are you just at this point, we don't know which test it's going to be?\nAdam Schechter: So I think there will be some. But Ricky, what I would say is that I look at the PCR testing almost as like a short-term opportunity in a period of time. And then once that's gone, there's going to be some type of impact to the ability to grow. But what you're going to want to look at is our underlying business. So I mentioned that we have 1 oncology trial for major pharma company. I mentioned that we're starting to see the power of the combined based on what we've done with the COVID testing. What we're looking to show you is the proof that says that having Diagnostics with Drug Development matters, which you're really starting to see now.  We won more than 350 or approximately 350 COVID trials, which is a very significant number of the total trials. And what you're going to start to see is that translating into our core business changing. So yes, I do think there will be some things that we'll continue to do with COVID testing over time, with vaccines and so forth. Whether that completely offsets PCR testing, I don't know. I mean, it depends on what it is, how often you do it and so forth. But importantly, the work and what we're showing with our underlying business is going to be where you'll see growth as we go out into future years.\nRivka Goldwasser: So then if you think about that, the pandemic clearly increased focus on the critical role of testing. Are you seeing this filtering already into discussions with health systems and payers beyond the COVID impact?\nAdam Schechter: I think people have a new recognition for the importance of testing and the importance of testing combined with Drug Development. And you already hearing people talk about antibiotic resistance that could be occurring based upon treatment of COVID and other things. And I think there are going to be other bugs that we're going to have to figure out how to detect and how to treat in the future. So I do believe that the world now has a different view of the importance of diagnostic testing.  And one of the things that I'm going to be advocating for very strongly is the removal of PAMA. There's no impact of PAMA for next year. But I think it should be removed entirely because I think part of the reason that we were not as prepared as we needed to be for this pandemic is because for years, people underestimated the importance of diagnostic testing. They starved the diagnostic testing business. State laboratories, for example, were using machines that were so old and antiquated that we need government and payers to understand that for us to have excess capacity, for us to have dual supply chains, for us to have the latest and greatest innovations, we need to continue to have fair reimbursement.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair.\nMatthew Larew: Adam, you referenced the sequential improvement in the base business Q2 to Q3, despite a second wave and then further improvement here in October despite record case consent in recent weeks. So just kind of curious what the key underlying improvements you're seeing. Is it as simple as PPE being available when offices are open? Curious about that. And then maybe just comment on demand trends in some geographies for perhaps a peak has already occurred. Are there places where you're actually seeing year-over-year growth at this point?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Matt, so we have seen some sequential improvement months-over-months. When the country shut down back in March, we saw almost all physicians offices or many of physicians offices shut down. And it took them a while to move over to telemedicine, frankly. And we saw the hospitals that were pretty overwhelmed and didn't have PPE, didn't have enough ventilators. And therefore, it was hard for people to get routine procedures and so forth. What we've now seen is even in areas that have a significant outbreak, the physician's offices still stay open or they have significant capabilities to telemedicine to keep people getting routine care. We've seen that the hospitals are able to now have enough PPE. They continue to do routine surgeries and procedures and so forth. So unless you saw a major shutdown of the health care system again, I think that you'll continue to see the sequential improvement. The only caveat I have is if it's a really significant flu season and physicians' offices are path of people coughing and sneezing and you don't know if it's flu or COVID, I think people may once again say, you know what, I'm going to wait to get my routine care. So that's why I'm hesitant to say what I think will happen in the coming months because it really, to some degree, in my opinion, is going to depend on how hard a flu season we hit.\nMatthew Larew: Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe just actually following up on the point you raised regarding flu season. Obviously, understanding that it's very early here, but just curious what you're hearing from your preferred physicians or maybe your own medical team about what preference will be for flu versus the combination test, whether it's for symptomatic or asymptomatic patients? Obviously, there's a variety of both modalities and test combinations that are now available.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So first thing, to answer your other question about geography, we're not really seeing a significant difference by geography based upon outbreaks. We're seeing pretty consistent growth. Some geographies are using more point-of-care tests, some are using other laboratories and so forth. But in general, I don't think you see a major difference in geography for us. With regard to the demand by test, I think for asymptomatic patients, they'll continue to do the COVID test alone, if they've been exposed to somebody or if they've been in contact with somebody that has the disease. I don't think there's any reason to do multiple tests if the person doesn't have symptoms. I think if somebody presents themselves in a doctor's office, they may do a flu point-of-care test. And if it's positive, they may say, okay, go home, take care of yourself. And if it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have you tested for COVID. I think in some situations, even for a positive flu test, they are going to say, you know what, let's just test you for COVID and flu anyway, just to be certain. If you have a negative flu test point of care, I think they're certainly going to test you for COVID if you have symptoms. And then the question is, will they add on a flu test because they know sometimes you get false negatives with the point-of-care test and it may just be easier to say let's add a flu test on there. So we're preparing for all of those different scenarios as we go forward. I think that the majority of tests will still be COVID alone, but there could be a significant number, particularly for symptomatic patients that are in combination for flu and/or RSV.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Leonard: So first off, how would you characterize any efforts you have underway to maintain your share of COVID molecular testing as it seems that there are new labs and new entrants spinning up all the time in this market?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Dan, so if you look at our share, I'll first start off with ACLA laboratories. So we get a sense ACLA reports the total number of tests. I know what our actual number of tests are, so I can calculate our share and we have a very strong share of ACLA labs. And in fact, it's growing slightly if you go quarter-over-quarter. The question you're asking, though, is with more point-of-care tests out there, with additional local laboratories, what could the future bring? What I would say is, to date, we haven't seen a very significant impact. I think this country needs as many tests as it can get, frankly. I think there is a need for point-of-care tests. I think for surveillance, having antigen tests available are helpful. I think in hospitals and nursing homes, you want faster tests to actually do surveillance. And then if you have positive cases, you do PCR test. So I actually think there's a role for all the different types of tests that we have in the marketplace. To me, the question really is what was asked before, which is once there's a vaccine, what does the role of testing look like? And that's where it's a little difficult to answer because what if a vaccine works in 70% of people and doesn't work in the other 30% and 1 of only 70% of people get the vaccine, so there's 30% that don't get it in the first place. Well, you still have a lot of people in that scenario that would want PCR testing over time. So we still have to learn more for that scenario.\nDaniel Leonard: I appreciate that. And then, Adam, for my follow-up, I appreciate that there's uncertainty around the market demand for the combo test as opposed to COVID stand-alone. But if demand for the combo test came in higher than you'd anticipate, how would you characterize your capacity on that test at LabCorp to meet the demand?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Dan, I can tell you, at a meeting with the team, I think, it was last week and we're continuing to have ongoing discussions. And we're gearing up for as many tests that we might need. When I talk about 210,000 capacity, it's the reagents that are a bit different, not necessarily the machinery. So as long as we have reagents to do those tests, we should be able to do as many as that if we need to. So we're going to continue to build the capacity and then we'll have -- we're trying to get enough reagents that we can go either way if we need to.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Glenn, I wanted to go back to your comment on increasing test per session. Do you think that's a consequence of COVID where physicians are sort of ordering more panels even outside of COVID and do you think there is sustainability of that where you get kind of a continued uplift there?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, Ralph, call it, speculative, but the feeling is there's probably been a fair amount of pent-up demand as people haven't been going for especially the routine testing. And so now as they're coming back, they're doing more tests, if you will, per that session is, call it, a catch-up, if you will. So we have seen it. We've seen it for the last couple of quarters. It picked up in this quarter. The assumption would be, obviously, that, that would start to come back down, still be a positive favorable price/mix for us, but probably not to the levels that we've seen at least over the couple of quarters, but we'll have to wait and see.\nRalph Giacobbe: Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then just quickly on -- if you could help on the volume mix of COVID. First between, if you could split out commercial versus Medicare versus Medicaid in terms of the volume mix of COVID. And then if you could also help across where it's essentially coming from between drive up sites versus employers versus universities versus health providers. I don't know if you have that breakout, but it would be helpful just to kind of understand where the volumes come from.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So let me start with the second question first. The vast majority of the tests that we do, I'm not talking about all the tests in the marketplace, but the ones that we do are still coming from urgent care centers, from physician offices, from people that are treating patients. We do some, obviously, from employers. We do some for hospitals still, but the vast majority is in those physician offices and in the urgent care centers, those types of places. We continue to see Pixel doing well. It's about 5% to 10% of our volume. And some of that is with employers, but a lot of that is just people ordering at home tests and we expect that will continue to be a good portion of our mix. And then if you look at the breakout, it's not too different than what you would expect the overall breakout of our business to be in terms of reimbursement because it's coming primarily from urgent cares and physicians.\nAdam Schechter: So I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Hopefully, you can see that LabCorp is leading with science. And I believe it's never been more important or more apparent than right now as we continue our unwavering commitment to our mission of improving health and improving lives. I can tell you that our team will continue to partner with our customers, our suppliers, other organizations who share our commitment to lead the way through this crisis. And at the same time, importantly, at the same time, we're going to continue to execute on our strategy for growth, which remains our long-term consistent strategy. We appreciate your time today. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We delivered strong results in the third quarter as our base business continued to recover and significant progress was achieved to fight the global pandemic. Clinical trial activity is improving and we've had important wins in both COVID and non-COVID-related clinical trials. The Diagnostics business has recovered well as people resume their routine preventive visits, actively care for their chronic conditions and move ahead with elective surgeries and other procedures. Non-COVID-related volume was down approximately 9% for the quarter. As a result, we reported growth in the third quarter versus the prior year with revenue of $3.9 billion, adjusted EPS of $8.41 and free cash flow of $709 million. Throughout the year, our COVID-19 testing has helped to offset the pressure experienced in our base business. This is the first quarter where both the Diagnostics and Drug Development total businesses grew versus prior year. Based on the current and expected strength of our business, we have decided to return the CARES Act Provider Relief Funds. We greatly appreciate the support that CARES Act funding afforded us in the early days of the pandemic when our base business was significantly impacted and the future was uncertain. We are pleased we can take this action now. Glenn will expand on this in a few moments. Importantly, our strategy extends beyond COVID-19. What LabCorp did prior to the pandemic and what we will do after the pandemic remains important to the country and to the world. Our strategy is based on the following long-term priorities: first, leveraging the power of our combined capabilities across Diagnostics and Drug Development; second, advancing our leadership position in oncology; third, integrating AI, data, digitalization and analytics across our business; fourth, putting customers at the center of all that we do; and finally, we will continue to evaluate and execute on high growth opportunities. Jack, this is Adam. I'll start with the recovery of the base business. I said it before that, it surprised me how fast the base business has recovered. If you go back to March, our base business at that point was down 55% versus the prior year. And this is looking at Diagnostics. If you then would look at June, our base business was down about 17% for the month of June. But for the quarter, second quarter, it was down 35%. If you look at third quarter, which we've just discussed, we're down 9% for the quarter. So you are seeing sequential improvements quarter-over-quarter. And frankly, we're seeing it month-over-month. So each month is a little bit better than the prior month. So we continue to see that coming back.  With regard to our other business, our Drug Development business, that's coming back a bit slower, not as quickly as the Diagnostic business. What we've seen is the preclinical, early stage work has come back the fastest of the 3 businesses in Drug Development. Last quarter, the central laboratory business was not coming back as quickly as the clinical development business. For this quarter, we've seen a significant acceleration in our central laboratory business and that has actually come back a bit faster than the clinical development business. With the clinical development business, we have access to about 70% of the sites now. So that's better than last quarter, but there's still about 30% of the sites that are not open for access at the moment. Jack, so when we launched the PCR testing, we had three core principles. The first one was to use science and innovation and build as much capacity as quickly as we could. The second was that everybody would have equal access to the testing. So we charge nobody upfront out-of-pocket cost and we charge everybody the Medicare rate. In fact, when we first launched the test, we launched it before we even knew what the Medicare rate was. And then the third thing was that nobody would be prioritized over anybody else. That as the test came into laboratories, we would do those tests first, with the only exception was when the CDC and HHS asked us to prioritize, so for example, for a hospital inpatients. And I think that those principles have served us well. And we adhere to those principles as we sit here today.  In terms of the longevity, I think for as long as the emergency declaration is here, which now is through the month of January and we'll see if it gets extended after that, I think that the pricing is consistent. You saw recently that there was a slight change to Medicare, where it still will be reimbursed for people up to $100, if your turnaround time is within 2 days. And the good news is our turnaround time is about a day. So that shouldn't have a significant impact on us for that Medicare change. And then we have to see what happens over time with the declaration of the emergency after the end of January next year. Yes. Go ahead, Glenn. And just to give you a little additional context. A couple of weeks ago, we were averaging about 110,000 PCR tests a day. Now we're averaging 120,000 PCR tests a day. We could go up to over 200,000 a day if the country needed it during the flu season. If you look at Australia, Brazil, Argentina and some other countries that have gone through the flu season, it hasn't been particularly a big flu season. In fact, it was very small in those countries. Could it be because they were in lockdown for COVID? That would help with the flu season? Yes, very possibly. So without knowing what the flu season could bring and we're just right at the start of it, you could see how much variability there could be. Yes. Well, so we've always looked at our capital allocation very carefully and thoughtfully. And our first and foremost thing that we look to do is to buy these tuck-in acquisitions, these local laboratories, local hospital laboratories where we can bring them into our business, very quickly they become accretive. They return their cost of capital within a very short period of time and we know how to integrate them. There are several of those that we're looking at. I can tell you, I believe that there has been an acceleration in the number of those possibilities as we go through this year into next year. And we'll look at capital allocation from that lens first and then we'll be opportunistic where it makes sense with the share repurchases. Yes. Thank you, Erin. So we're making significant progress with COVID on both the diagnostic and in the clinical trial business. Many of the studies -- said that we've done about 300 -- we've won about 350 of those opportunities. Many of them are very early stage, smaller trials, where we're doing in the preclinical work or we're doing design work and those types of things. And then there are others that are late-stage in the vaccine space where we're actively involved at the moment. They are not materially impacting the revenue at the moment. So that's why we didn't call out revenue specifically. But as we go through time, they'll become more meaningful for us.  In terms of vaccine versus the other types of treatments, there's less vaccines out there, but the vaccine trials are much, much bigger than the other trials. So I would say in numbers of trials, most of them are outside of vaccines. But when you look at volume, there's a lot of volume coming through the vaccines. Yes. So I'll start with in the Diagnostic business. One of the things that I've said before that has surprised me since starting as the CEO here last November is that there are lots of opportunities and lots of discussions that occur about acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, but they just take a bit longer than I had expected. I thought that they make so much economic sense for both the laboratory that's looking to be acquired and for LabCorp that I thought they would go faster. So at the moment, there are many more that we're looking at today than what I would have said before, particularly if you look at the size and scale of some of them, but how fast they go is impossible for me to predict because they have, in the past, taken longer than I expected.  In terms of other acquisitions, we mentioned GlobalCare and snapIoT. Those were two acquisitions that would help us with decentralized clinical trials and hybrid trials. We've said that those were critical to our strategy and they were smaller tuck-in types of acquisitions to help with our strategy. So we'll continue to look for smaller tuck-in acquisitions that help us strategically. I do not see the need, as I sit here today, to do any type of very large scale acquisition. I think that we have what we need to be successful and we can augment it with smaller targeted strategic acquisitions. Yes. Kevin, the mix is about the same. What's been interesting is in the beginning of the pandemic, when our base business was down significantly, our esoteric business did not fall as fast as our other business. Last quarter, we said that both businesses were coming back about equal. Now I would say in the third quarter, our base business actually came back a bit faster than the esoteric business. So we're not necessarily seeing a long-term mix shift but we've seen a different impact on the 2 businesses as we've gone through the year. Yes. So Kevin, as I mentioned, right now, we can do more than 210,000 tests per day. And our turnaround time today is about 1 day. Now right now, we're testing an average about 120,000 tests. And I would say we could go much higher and I still think maintain our current turnaround time or just be within the 48 hours. The 210,000 does not include our pooling that we're able to do. And if we needed to do more pooling, we could increase that pretty significantly. But also, we're looking at adding additional capacity in terms of machines and capabilities. So as we said from the beginning, one of our core tenets was to build capacity as quickly as we can. We've been doing that since March. In July, there was a significant increase in the number of samples that we were receiving. And no matter how fast we had built capacity, we still fell a little bit behind. So even though right now we're running at about 50% of our capacity, we are not slowing down. We're going to continue to buy the machines that we can buy. And to me, that's the biggest rate-limiting is the number of larger machines that we can get as we go into the fall flu season. Yes. Absolutely, Lisa. So we are currently able to do the flu, PCR and also RSV test through physicians. We also notably filed an EUA to be able to do it with our Pixel and our LabCorp At Home test. I think that as we go into flu season, if somebody has a lot of symptoms, it might be nice that they not even have to go to a doctor. Their doctor can send them a test, so they can order a test and get the results. If you look at the Medicare rates, we believe it's going to be about $143 for the combined test. And as we've done in the past, we've used the Medicare rate as our guide as we've gone through the pandemic and the emergency declaration. So we'll continue to do that. With regard to how we record that, Lisa, I think we have to think that through. As we decide, we'll certainly make sure that we talk to you and let the external environment know how we're thinking about it. To date, so we've gotten very few because we're really not in the flu season yet. So there hasn't been a real need at the moment for the combined test. Yes. So I'll give you my thoughts on it, but anybody that tells you that they have any significant degree of certainty is wrong. That's the only part I'm certain about, what I'm about to say. I believe that we'll have a lot more data by the end of this year to know the effectiveness of the various vaccines that are in Phase III. And that's going to be very helpful. And if we have vaccines that can move forward into the marketplace, I think it could start early next year. But before you could vaccinate a significant number of the population in U.S., I think you're probably talking about the middle of next year, my personal opinion, based upon experience without knowing all the facts. So I think that they're going to need continued testing for at least through the first quarter of next year for PCR testing. I think you're going to continue to need it as you go into the second part of the year. And then by the time you get to the summertime, hopefully, we'll have the vaccine broadly disseminated and the need for PCR testing will be significantly diminished. The two questions we have are: one, we know the pricing relatively certain what it could look like through January. We have to see what the pricing will look like after January. My assumption is that why wouldn't you continue to have the emergency authorization through the winter, but we just don't know that for sure. And then the second thing to realize with the vaccine is we don't know are there going to be antibody tests, titer tests, they're going to be neutralizing antibody tests that might be helpful as people go through the vaccine. So we're developing a suite of tests. We announced last week our test for the antibodies that we give you quantitative analysis used in pharmaceuticals, to try to help understand what might be helpful. So will there be additional tests that we can do to help in the future even after vaccine? My assumption is probably, but we still have to wait to see the data. Is it going to be T cells? Or is it going to be antibody? There's still a lot more we're going to learn over the coming months. Yes. So let me give you some context. One of the things that I had mentioned before is when we saw the decline in our business in Covance, we did not reduce the size and the number of people that we had. And the reason why is a lot of these people are hard to find. They're hard to train. We thought -- and we're seeing the business coming back. So I'd be careful with the margins because the margins are a little bit worse than they typically would be because we're still seeing the revenue come back. But at the same time, we kept a bit of the expenses for the people so that we didn't have to try to rehire and refine people that we already had. Sure. So we continue to have a very strong relationship with United. And we were pleased that we were put on to p.r.n. again in July of this year. Frankly, I thought at this time this year, I'll be able to give you an update on how the p.r.n. has worked since we entered into it about a year ago. And unfortunately, with the pandemic, we haven't seen a significant amount of progress, but we are continuing to be optimistic that it makes a lot of sense and we'll be able to work with United to get the p.r.n. up and running and to help them shift the business to where they want to shift it to, which is to the high-quality, lower cost laboratories like ourselves. And the PLN -- it's the PLN, Preferred Laboratory Network, is something that other managed care plans have begun to talk about those types of things. I believe that they -- we're waiting to see if it worked. And now that they've waited a while, even though we don't necessarily know if it works or not, I think we might see more of that as we move forward because everybody realizes the economic advantage of having these PLNs in place. And I think we'll see more and more of it as we go into the future. So stay tuned. No. As I said before, we could do 210,000 tests a day. We're doing 120,000 tests. We're using that facility opportunistically. But if we had other things that we needed to do in that facility, we would obviously use other facilities to run the test. One of the good things that we did was to go and run our tests on multiple platforms. So we're running on 8 different platforms. But at the same time, we have a network across the United States that we can kind of have materials and samples sent to the laboratories that will have the best turnaround time. And we can use our network to say, let's send more samples to this laboratory, less to that one, more to this one and we can do it on a very routine basis. So we have the ability to flex where we need to flex. Yes. Sure. So our reimbursement in this quarter was about the same as last quarter. It was in the mid-80s to upper 80s and that's been consistent. And as I mentioned before, with our three principles, the second principle is that we charge people the Medicare rate, which is $100. As we continue to be in the emergency declaration, which is through the first month of next year, I think the 22nd or something like that of January, I believe we'll continue to have good reimbursement. The question will be, will they continue the emergency declaration? If they do, I believe reimbursement will continue or if they don't, I think we'll have pressure on pricing without the emergency declaration. The other thing is you did see that Medicare is now still reimbursing for $100 per patient, but only if your turnaround time is two days. And you have to average two days for the month before and be two days brings with the test. The good news is that we're at about a 1 day turnaround time. So we feel pretty comfortable with that. But we'll continue as we go through the fall season and we see numbers increase, watch that extraordinarily closely. Yes. We're really not seeing any significant change in payer mix. It's pretty consistent as it's been in the past. Yes, absolutely, Ricky. And I still believe that the serology testing is going to be important in the future. I just don't think we have the science yet to tell us. Is it neutralizing antibodies, is it total antibodies, quantitative analysis, T cell involvement outside of antibodies. So my only comment was meant to say that there's a lot more science that needs to be done. If it really is, is it going to be an annual vaccine? Or is it going to be every couple of years? If it's more than every year, you'll need titers measured and those types of things. So I think there will be a role.  We're in conversations, I'd say, with most if not all the major pharma companies, conversations with operation more speed and conversations with many other science and thought leaders in this area. So we're building a whole series of potential ways to measure the impact of vaccines. I can't tell you which one is going to work. But I can tell you, if there is something, which historically there has been, we're going to do everything as we can to be ready for it. So I think there will be some. But Ricky, what I would say is that I look at the PCR testing almost as like a short-term opportunity in a period of time. And then once that's gone, there's going to be some type of impact to the ability to grow. But what you're going to want to look at is our underlying business. So I mentioned that we have 1 oncology trial for major pharma company. I mentioned that we're starting to see the power of the combined based on what we've done with the COVID testing. What we're looking to show you is the proof that says that having Diagnostics with Drug Development matters, which you're really starting to see now.  We won more than 350 or approximately 350 COVID trials, which is a very significant number of the total trials. And what you're going to start to see is that translating into our core business changing. So yes, I do think there will be some things that we'll continue to do with COVID testing over time, with vaccines and so forth. Whether that completely offsets PCR testing, I don't know. I mean, it depends on what it is, how often you do it and so forth. But importantly, the work and what we're showing with our underlying business is going to be where you'll see growth as we go out into future years. I think people have a new recognition for the importance of testing and the importance of testing combined with Drug Development. And you already hearing people talk about antibiotic resistance that could be occurring based upon treatment of COVID and other things. And I think there are going to be other bugs that we're going to have to figure out how to detect and how to treat in the future. So I do believe that the world now has a different view of the importance of diagnostic testing.  And one of the things that I'm going to be advocating for very strongly is the removal of PAMA. There's no impact of PAMA for next year. But I think it should be removed entirely because I think part of the reason that we were not as prepared as we needed to be for this pandemic is because for years, people underestimated the importance of diagnostic testing. They starved the diagnostic testing business. State laboratories, for example, were using machines that were so old and antiquated that we need government and payers to understand that for us to have excess capacity, for us to have dual supply chains, for us to have the latest and greatest innovations, we need to continue to have fair reimbursement. Yes. Matt, so we have seen some sequential improvement months-over-months. When the country shut down back in March, we saw almost all physicians offices or many of physicians offices shut down. And it took them a while to move over to telemedicine, frankly. And we saw the hospitals that were pretty overwhelmed and didn't have PPE, didn't have enough ventilators. And therefore, it was hard for people to get routine procedures and so forth. What we've now seen is even in areas that have a significant outbreak, the physician's offices still stay open or they have significant capabilities to telemedicine to keep people getting routine care. We've seen that the hospitals are able to now have enough PPE. They continue to do routine surgeries and procedures and so forth. So unless you saw a major shutdown of the health care system again, I think that you'll continue to see the sequential improvement. The only caveat I have is if it's a really significant flu season and physicians' offices are path of people coughing and sneezing and you don't know if it's flu or COVID, I think people may once again say, you know what, I'm going to wait to get my routine care. So that's why I'm hesitant to say what I think will happen in the coming months because it really, to some degree, in my opinion, is going to depend on how hard a flu season we hit. Yes. So first thing, to answer your other question about geography, we're not really seeing a significant difference by geography based upon outbreaks. We're seeing pretty consistent growth. Some geographies are using more point-of-care tests, some are using other laboratories and so forth. But in general, I don't think you see a major difference in geography for us. With regard to the demand by test, I think for asymptomatic patients, they'll continue to do the COVID test alone, if they've been exposed to somebody or if they've been in contact with somebody that has the disease. I don't think there's any reason to do multiple tests if the person doesn't have symptoms. I think if somebody presents themselves in a doctor's office, they may do a flu point-of-care test. And if it's positive, they may say, okay, go home, take care of yourself. And if it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have you tested for COVID. I think in some situations, even for a positive flu test, they are going to say, you know what, let's just test you for COVID and flu anyway, just to be certain. If you have a negative flu test point of care, I think they're certainly going to test you for COVID if you have symptoms. And then the question is, will they add on a flu test because they know sometimes you get false negatives with the point-of-care test and it may just be easier to say let's add a flu test on there. So we're preparing for all of those different scenarios as we go forward. I think that the majority of tests will still be COVID alone, but there could be a significant number, particularly for symptomatic patients that are in combination for flu and/or RSV. Yes. Dan, so if you look at our share, I'll first start off with ACLA laboratories. So we get a sense ACLA reports the total number of tests. I know what our actual number of tests are, so I can calculate our share and we have a very strong share of ACLA labs. And in fact, it's growing slightly if you go quarter-over-quarter. The question you're asking, though, is with more point-of-care tests out there, with additional local laboratories, what could the future bring? What I would say is, to date, we haven't seen a very significant impact. I think this country needs as many tests as it can get, frankly. I think there is a need for point-of-care tests. I think for surveillance, having antigen tests available are helpful. I think in hospitals and nursing homes, you want faster tests to actually do surveillance. And then if you have positive cases, you do PCR test. So I actually think there's a role for all the different types of tests that we have in the marketplace. To me, the question really is what was asked before, which is once there's a vaccine, what does the role of testing look like? And that's where it's a little difficult to answer because what if a vaccine works in 70% of people and doesn't work in the other 30% and 1 of only 70% of people get the vaccine, so there's 30% that don't get it in the first place. Well, you still have a lot of people in that scenario that would want PCR testing over time. So we still have to learn more for that scenario. Yes. Dan, I can tell you, at a meeting with the team, I think, it was last week and we're continuing to have ongoing discussions. And we're gearing up for as many tests that we might need. When I talk about 210,000 capacity, it's the reagents that are a bit different, not necessarily the machinery. So as long as we have reagents to do those tests, we should be able to do as many as that if we need to. So we're going to continue to build the capacity and then we'll have -- we're trying to get enough reagents that we can go either way if we need to. Yes. So let me start with the second question first. The vast majority of the tests that we do, I'm not talking about all the tests in the marketplace, but the ones that we do are still coming from urgent care centers, from physician offices, from people that are treating patients. We do some, obviously, from employers. We do some for hospitals still, but the vast majority is in those physician offices and in the urgent care centers, those types of places. We continue to see Pixel doing well. It's about 5% to 10% of our volume. And some of that is with employers, but a lot of that is just people ordering at home tests and we expect that will continue to be a good portion of our mix. And then if you look at the breakout, it's not too different than what you would expect the overall breakout of our business to be in terms of reimbursement because it's coming primarily from urgent cares and physicians. So I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Hopefully, you can see that LabCorp is leading with science. And I believe it's never been more important or more apparent than right now as we continue our unwavering commitment to our mission of improving health and improving lives. I can tell you that our team will continue to partner with our customers, our suppliers, other organizations who share our commitment to lead the way through this crisis. And at the same time, importantly, at the same time, we're going to continue to execute on our strategy for growth, which remains our long-term consistent strategy. We appreciate your time today. Have a great day."

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and end with some comments on our outlook. For third quarter results, we have quantified the revenue associated with the COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests, so that you can see the change in the base business. Also during the quarter, we received $76 million in CARES Act Provider Relief Funding, which is excluded from earnings but included in cash flow. As Adam mentioned, we decided to return the funds in the fourth quarter, as well as the $56 million of funds we received in the second quarter. As a result, we have reversed the $56 million CARES Act funds from our earnings in the third quarter. Jack, this is Glenn. Just to your other question on kind of the volume being down, but the favorable price/mix being up and Adam, obviously, just went through the volume decline. On the price/mix, as you know, in kind of a normal environment. Diagnostics overall does kind of the 1% to 2% organic volume and then we pick up around a point on favorable price/mix. And obviously, the last couple of quarters are anything but in a normal environment. We have seen favorable price/mix over the last two quarters. We were up around 5% last quarter and now up around 7% this quarter. The biggest driving factor to the improvement in price/mix really has been an increase in our test per session. We've also seen an improvement in the mix. And to your point, some categories, in particular, like women's health or NIPT or hepatitis screening seem to be the bigger test parts that we've seen a higher growth rate than the other. But overall, a favorable mix, but again, the biggest driver being the amount of tests we're doing per session. Yes. Just a comment for the guidance. It's less of, call it, an issue on the cost. It's more just the significant variance in potential outcomes relative to the business demand. So obviously, we've seen in the third quarter, as Adam and I commented in our remarks, the business is performing well sequentially, ending the quarter even better than where we started. So obviously, at the current run rates, we would expect to see continued good results.  As we enter into the fall, again, the flu season, we just don't know the restrictions that may be in place, what the impact of the base businesses will be going forward. So really, the uncertainty being driven more off of what's the demand of the business, could be continued strength, could be some softness, if we see a pretty bad flu season ahead of us. But overall, the cost structure of the company is in place. And frankly, one of the benefits to the margin improvement is being able to leverage that cost control, while we're seeing enhanced revenues. Eric, I guess, just a question. Are you trying to back out the impact of the award... I think the distinction, though, is that when you -- and Adam kind of commented. We have, obviously, a lot of awards that have come in, a lot of tending to be more on the early side of our business. So when you look at the book-to-bill that's coming in from, call it, the non-COVID testing, but the awards that we're getting for vaccine or therapeutics would be, call it, at a lower book-to-bill, if you will, than what we've been experiencing overall. So if anything, taking out a lower ratio of book-to-bill for at least the awards that we have, you could even argue, could move it somewhat the other way. I think for the businesses that are seeing more on the late-stage clinical trials for those awards, that tend to be longer book-to-bill time periods. You might see a different outcome than what we're currently experiencing. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is that when you -- we've talked about that kind of the organic revenue growth was really the PCR testing. So we would have been flat otherwise. So organically, still a positive, call it, flat in the pandemic, flat organic revenue. So from a margin standpoint, plus or minus, assume that our margins, excluding the PCR testing, would be relatively flat as well. As Adam said, the headwind from, call it, the personnel side of it, but we also have kind of the tailwind from our LaunchPad initiative. In addition, we get some leverage from -- we talked about the currency conversion and some acquisitions that would be additive as well. The flat would be in explaining the change in our margins, where we're up around, call it, 200 basis points in margin. Assume that's being attributable to the PCR testing and that margins overall would be relatively flat with the explanation that both Adam and I gave for that. That's relatively flat. Yes. Yes. Brian, I guess, similar. Obviously, the big driver in the margin improvement, as you pointed out, was the COVID testing. We actually did leverage well, even excluding COVID testing in Diagnostics. This business a little bit, kind of, the opposite on the Drug Development side. As Adam said, we have the personnel for the business that we have. So we have a little bit more of a headwind on Diagnostics because of the significant growth in the business. We continue to add personnel as we're going. So we -- from a personnel standpoint, we really leverage. So with the LaunchPad savings we had in the quarter, margins held up really well, even despite the negative impact of PAMA with the Diagnostics. But strong under, call it, the base business underlying the margins were -- came in very strong. Yes. I think that's the end on bad debt accruals. Good. Yes, I just want to make sure I understood the question, right. Yes. From a bad debt standpoint, obviously, as you know, we reserved in the first quarter, $17 million. We have seen an increase in the bad debt, just given the financial strain that obviously is impacting some of our clients. We feel that the reserves that we've established are adequate, but there's no question we've seen a little bit of a pickup in the bad debt, but we feel our rate that we accrue for is very adequate relative to the expectations that we have for that going forward. Yes, Ralph, call it, speculative, but the feeling is there's probably been a fair amount of pent-up demand as people haven't been going for especially the routine testing. And so now as they're coming back, they're doing more tests, if you will, per that session is, call it, a catch-up, if you will. So we have seen it. We've seen it for the last couple of quarters. It picked up in this quarter. The assumption would be, obviously, that, that would start to come back down, still be a positive favorable price/mix for us, but probably not to the levels that we've seen at least over the couple of quarters, but we'll have to wait and see."

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Clarissa Willett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nClarissa Willett: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to LabCorp\u2019s second quarter 2020 conference call. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning in the Investor Relations section of our website at labcorp.com, we posted both, our press release and an investor relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today\u2019s call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements with respect to expectations for 2020 and the related assumptions, including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial conditions, our responses to and the expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business more generally, as well as on general economic, business and market conditions. Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change, based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and in the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any update to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. For more than 50 years, LabCorp has led through science, innovation and technology. During the current pandemic, that leadership has been front and center, when the world has needed us most. I continue to be impressed with how quickly our teams have rallied to confront each and every challenge put before them. And I want to thank our 65,000 employees as their efforts have been heroic during this difficult time. During the second quarter, we delivered solid performance across the Company, despite the impact of the pandemic. We delivered revenue of $2.8 billion, adjusted EPS of $2.57 and free cash flow of $272 million. We were encouraged to see steady recovery in our Base Business during the quarter for both diagnostic and drug development, as people are starting to return to their doctors for testing and clinical trials activity is resuming, including those that are for COVID-19 related research.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I\u2019m going to start my comments with the review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with some commentary regarding our current expectations for the remainder of 2020. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we were able to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our results, given that the impact was late in the quarter. However, we commented that we would not be able to do that going forward. For second quarter results, we have quantified the revenue associated with the COVID-19 molecular and serology tests, so that you can see the change in the Base Business.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is now open.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much for all the details. A quick question on Covance. I\u2019m just curious if you could give us some sense on the nature of the strong bookings, particularly how much might be related to COVID-specific work. And maybe as a follow-on to that, if you could give us any details on the performance of the three segments, clinical, central lab and early development, how those individually played out during the quarter? Thanks very much.\nAdam Schechter: Hi, Eric. Good morning. So, Covance had a very good quarter. And I think it continues to show the power of having both, diagnostics and drug development together. If you look, we had put together a enterprise-only response team. And that team includes people from both, our diagnostics business and our scientists from diagnostics together with people and scientists from drug development. And we\u2019ve been participating in discussions on almost every vaccine and almost every treatment for COVID-19. With that said, as I mentioned in my script, most of those trials are still pretty early stage. So for the quarter, they didn\u2019t necessarily contribute a very significant amount of dollars. As we move forward, I believe that it will be increasingly important in terms of our revenue. If you look at the three parts of our business, our early development and central laboratories began to come back quicker than the clinical work. And that\u2019s because if, for example, we have a central lab in China, as China opened up, we saw the capacity fill pretty fast. And as markets opened where we have the central laboratories, we\u2019ve seen those countries continue to increase with the capacity that we have, quickly. Early development, we continue to do very well and that includes some of the early work that I just mentioned for COVID-19. Clinical, we have seen an increase in accessibility of sites, and that\u2019s gone up fairly significantly, particularly driven by Asia. Although there\u2019s not as many sites in Asia, as there are in the U.S. and Europe, most of the sites in Asia are now accessible. However, many companies are still waiting until there\u2019s global accessibility before starting some of those particularly later stage Phase 3 trials, and I think that\u2019s still going to take some time. So that business coming back has taken longer than the other two.\nEric Coldwell: Yes. Adam, your peers that have reported to-date, have talked about COVID awards comprising somewhere between call it, high-teens and even mid-twenties of total bookings. Could you share with us, your experience?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, I am not going to give you the exact percent, because it\u2019s a book-to-bill, as you can imagine, it moves based upon what makes it through Phase 1 and to Phase 2 and so forth. But we\u2019re not that dependent on COVID-19 trials at the moment. So, I can compare to their numbers, but our numbers are not as dependent upon COVID.\nEric Coldwell: Got it. Thanks very much.\nAdam Schechter: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Adam, I was hoping to get your perspective as to how you think testing for COVID-19 is going to evolve as we head into the fall. What portion of the testing do you think is going to move to pool method? Do you think molecular is going to remain a good to approach? And just any perspectives on antigen testing would be great.\nAdam Schechter: Absolutely. Good morning, Jack. So, the first thing I would say, it\u2019s been pretty remarkable how in early March we were doing 2,000 to 3,000 PCR tests per week. And here we are in the end of July and we\u2019re able to do 180,000 PCR tests per day. I mean, that\u2019s just astonishing. For people that understand the type of equipment that you need to run PCR tests, it\u2019s completely different than what you would need for blood tests, and we\u2019ve had to build significant capacity. I believe that we have to continue to build capacity. We don\u2019t know for certain what the fall will bring. But, as schools open up, as businesses open up and as the fall flu season comes to fruition, I think we\u2019re going to continue to do more testing. And I do believe that PCR testing will remain the gold standard for telling if somebody currently has the disease. And therefore, we will continue to build the past feet as fast as we can and overcome some of the issues that we face in terms of supplies and machinery. At the same time, I think that all testing is going to play a role. Pool testing is particularly helpful in areas with low prevalence, in things like back-to-school or back-to-work because with low prevalence, you can do the pool testing and then you don\u2019t have to do any retesting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the most significant amount of testing that we\u2019re doing. In fact, I believe that the standard PCR testing in the fall will remain the most significant by far of the testing that we do for PCR. But, I do think that the pool testing will add to our capacity and give us additional capabilities. Things like antigen testing, I think have a role also. So for example, if you wanted to test a large group of people with antigen testing, point-of-care, get quick answers, you could then see if there\u2019s any positive people in that large group. If there are, I would go back and test them with PCR testing. If there\u2019s none, I would probably feel pretty comfortable that I don\u2019t have to retest. The issue with the antigen testing has been today is that you can miss some positives. So, you want to make sure if you have somebody positive, you test the people that tested negative. But if it\u2019s a pretty population, it would be a statistical anomaly for everybody to test falsely negative. So if you see one positive in that population, I would go back and retest them with PCR. So, I think we\u2019re going to need all the capacity we can get to get through the fall, assuming that the flu season could be big, and we\u2019re all doing the best we can to prepare for it.\nJack Meehan: Great. Thank you. And maybe just building off that, given some of the expectations around testing in the second half, how are the incremental margins on the COVID testing stacking up versus the Base Business? And what\u2019s your philosophy on reinvesting portion of that back into the business?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, I\u2019ll give you a broad statement. I\u2019ll ask Glenn to give you some specifics. But, we\u2019re going to continue to build capacity irrespective of cost, and that\u2019s been our philosophy from the beginning. Buy as many machines as we can, get as much testing equipment as we can. And frankly, that\u2019s what got us to 180,000 per day, along with our scientific capabilities. The LabCorp\u2019s scientists have just been extraordinary to get us where we are today. And I want to continue to build that. It will be a good day if we get to fall and we have more capacity than the number of samples that we get in. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to strive for, albeit it\u2019s not going to be easy. We need help from our suppliers. We are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to try to get more reagents, more machines and so forth. But, in terms of the margins, I\u2019ll let Glenn give you some specifics.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure. Jack, we\u2019ve commented in the past that when we -- obviously given the fixed cost nature of the diagnostics business, the incremental dropdown for new testing, call it was around 65%. So, we\u2019ve used that example when there\u2019s been weather and what\u2019s happened. So, the COVID testing clearly falls within the ballpark, if you will, of what we would have experienced with our other testing. So, obviously, helping contribute to the improved leverage, if you will, with the additional testing that we\u2019re doing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wolf Research. Your line is now open.\nStephen Baxter: I wanted to follow up on the pooling for molecular testing. So, my understanding was you will initially be doing this on your LTD. I guess, how much of your daily volume today runs through the LTD? And what do you think is the multiplier effect that you\u2019ll get on that capacity? And then, just as a follow-up, what\u2019s the process for expanding pooling onto your other testing platforms? And then, when do you expect to see that occur? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Stephen. The first thing I\u2019d say is that we launched back in March with our LDT, and that\u2019s a laboratory developed test by LabCorp\u2019s scientists. And it\u2019s been remarkable, the amount of volume that we\u2019ve been able to do through that LDT. Of course, we still need our suppliers and the other companies to help us to get to 180,000. But I have to say that our scientists did an extraordinary job with the LDT to get up to 180,000 today. I\u2019m not going to give you the exact number through the LDT because that changes. It changes based upon we have 16 labs running tests, different labs have the LDT, different labs have other equipment. So, at the end of the day, it depends on where the samples are, which tests we run them. And what we try to do is optimize our network, so we can get the best possible turnaround we can. To be at two to three days right now, turn around for patients and the hospital inpatient even faster says that we\u2019ve found a real way to use our capacity and distribute it successfully. With regards to the pool tests, I don\u2019t think that we want to give a certain percent that will go through that. Instead, what I would say is we\u2019re going to make sure that as much of our LDT that is a significant amount of our volume, it\u2019s a significant amount, and go through that if we need it. At the same time, we\u2019ll have to file EUAs to use other platforms, to run the pooled analysis on, and we would expect to do that as we move forward. But for now, I think with our LDT, we can do as much pooling as what we would deem appropriate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. Adam, I want to go back to the core volume. Can you give us any color as to what you\u2019ve seen thus far in July, especially in areas of the country where we have seen some level of resurgence, would be my first question. And then, secondly, I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but just curious around your continued expectation on the reimbursement guide for COVID testing.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. Good morning, Lisa. And, it was interesting because in the first quarter, when we saw the volumes up by 55% in the month of March, we didn\u2019t know how fast it would come back. And there was a concern that it could take an extended period of time. To be Frank with you, I\u2019ve been surprised at how fast it has come back. As states have opened, we\u2019ve seen the testing come back more significantly. For example, as Florida and Texas and Georgia opened up first, we saw the core testing come back faster. As states begin to modulate and slow down a little bit, you see the testing slow down. So, there\u2019s definitely a correlation between how far and how fast the states have opened and how far and how fast our Base Businesses has come back. What I would say is, for June, it was the first time since COVID that we saw that the total testing including our COVID testing was above prior year. In July, it\u2019s still early, we don\u2019t have all the data for the month, but we\u2019re seeing continued strength in the Base Business in base testing. The reason that we have not giving guidance for the rest of the year is because as we say, it\u2019s impossible to know how fast states will move, will they slow down a little bit, if they see additional breakout? What will the fall look like? What could happen? Will it be another slowdown to the Base Business? So, we\u2019re watching it, I mean, frankly, almost every day. But, we want to make sure that we continue to do the best we can to be able to forecast that. In terms of reimbursement, they did announce, HHS that they extended the emergency in the United States. Typically, that lasts for another 90 days. We assume that the reimbursement will continue to be strong as we go through the emergency situation, and then we\u2019ll just have to see what happens as we go after that 9-day extension.\nLisa Gill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So, hoping you could elaborate further on what you\u2019re seeing from the return-to-work demand front. Adam, you mentioned, you\u2019re connected with hundreds of employers. But, I\u2019d love to be able to quantify that or better understand the magnitude in some fashion.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Sure, Dan. Good morning. The first thing I would say is that, I spend a lot of time talking to other CEOs, talking to presidents of universities, and we try to help them understand ways that they can think about going back to work or back-to-school, and different companies and universities are thinking about different approaches. And sometimes it depends on if they\u2019re in a hotspot, if they\u2019re in an area of very low prevalence, what type of workforce they have, their healthcare workers, do they have factory workers? So, a lot of things go into the discussion and it\u2019s a multi-variant discussion. In general, the first thing that we talked about is the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, ensuring the work place is clean, good hygiene, cleaning elevators and elevator bottoms, ensuring the air flow in the buildings are appropriate. Prevention and keeping people out of work that are sick, having temperature checks before they come into school or work, questionnaires, that\u2019s all critical. The second thing is that, once somebody does make it into school or workplace and has any symptoms, you want to test them with PCR as quickly as possible, and you want to have tracking and tracing capabilities and be able to track and trace anybody that\u2019s been around them. And then, you want to have a place to isolate them, particularly if you\u2019re in a university while you wait for the results to come back. And that\u2019s why having the type of turnaround that we do two to three days is so important for tracking and tracing. And then, ultimately, over time, we want to work with them to get flu vaccinations for their workforce, so that when they get to the fall flu season, they\u2019ll have a sense as to what is flu versus what might be COVID-19. So, we\u2019re trying to work with these companies across the entire upfront of what they can be thinking about as they go into the August, September timeframe. What I can say is a lot of my time is spent on talking them how them doing testing because the types of testing people have said is, why don\u2019t I test everybody once a week? I don\u2019t think that makes a lot of sense to do that. I think, if they want to do surveillance, that\u2019s fine. But to try to test everybody once a week that\u2019ll give you one point in time. And the next day, if somebody is sick and starts to spread it, you won\u2019t necessarily have done a lot. You\u2019ve spent a lot of money on testing that probably was not the best use of your time and money. So, to be honest with you, I spend a lot of time trying to help them think about it logically, and a lot of my time is trying to make them understand how to best use testing and where it\u2019s appropriate. And I can tell you, I\u2019m spending a lot of my time and my team is spending a lot of time talking to these folks.\nDan Leonard: I appreciate all that color. And then, for my follow-up, Adam, you commented earlier about the differential trends at Covance by line of business. Can you also comment by customer segment between large pharma, maybe midsize pharma and what you\u2019re seeing out of the emerging biotech crowd that has been pretty successful raising money to-date?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. I would say we\u2019re seeing increases and we\u2019re seeing business across all biopharma, pharma, large, small, U.S., ex-U.S. But, it\u2019s in the lines of business, like I mentioned to you earlier that we\u2019re seeing the business come back faster in early development, central laboratories, and over time as we will see more in the clinical area. But, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a differentiation and segmentation across the customers within those segments. We\u2019re seeing strength frankly, and RFPs across them all.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nDonald Hooker: Great. Good morning. I was curious, you guys took a receivable reserve, I think last quarter, given the potential for cash collection issues, obviously with more unemployment. How has that played out? And how -- I know you guys have invested a lot in technologies in that area as well to mitigate that. Can you maybe elaborate on your experience there?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Hi, Don. It\u2019s Glenn. Yes. As you mentioned, the first quarter, given the pandemic coming and looking back at other times where we\u2019re seeing significant financial disruption and how it impacted our client base, we established a reserve of $17 million. We have seen an increase in our bad debt experience, but we feel that the reserves that we have established are very adequate going forward and nothing that was unexpected, at least at this time.\nDonald Hooker: Okay. Super. And then, maybe just last question for me in the Covance business, given all the disruptions, are you seeing any change in pricing across the various lines of business you have there, particularly early development?\nAdam Schechter: No, in general, we\u2019re not seeing any significant changes.\nDonald Hooker: Okay. That is helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from DB. Your line is now open.\nJustin Bowers: Hi. Good morning. This is Justin Bowers on for Pito. And thanks for the questions. Just with respect to pooling are you -- is the plan to roll that out to all of the 19 test sites? And then, secondarily, when we do some quick math on the multiplier effect, we arrive, let\u2019s say 300,000 to 350,000 like a theoretical capacity. But, just based on your earlier comments, it sounds like, molecular is going to be the primary modality. So, can you help us to think about kind of the ramp there or what the capacity is with pooling? And then, I\u2019ll stop there.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thanks for the question, Justin. And pooling is an important piece, but it\u2019s not, in my opinion going to be the primary piece. PCR testing will continue to be the primary piece of what we do. And if you look at our labs, we will not be rolling out pooling all of our labs. It takes a lot of technical capabilities to do the analysis, the analytics to hold the samples where you test the samples. It is a lot of work and you need some specialized equipment from it. So, we\u2019ll have it in multiple laboratories, but certainly not across all laboratories. And then, we have to make sure we use it in the right patient population. So, we\u2019re not going to just broadly start trying to pool patients. We\u2019re going to look for the right places and the right parts of the country or the right organizations where we believe the prevalence will be such that pooling makes sense. What I would avoid is, trying to go to theoretical capacity. And for example, right now, we can do 180,000 tests per day. We have done in a day, 180,000 tests and we know we can. But, I would not take 180,000 and times it by 7 and try to figure out capacity. Because if you can do 180,000, but you want to maintain a one to two-day or two to three-day turnaround, you don\u2019t want to run at full capacity. You want to be below that. So, we\u2019re going to continue to ensure that we do as many tests as we can, but we want to manage the turnaround time as best we can as well. So, to me, theoretical capacity is just that. But that\u2019s not how I build our financial model. I build it based upon practical utilization of the test, of which pooling will be a part of, but the overall PCR testing will drive it.\nJustin Bowers: I appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up. In terms of the Base Business, when you look at some of the areas where some of the hotspots around the country now, how is the Base Business trending versus like earlier in the pandemic? And just trying to get a sense of like the magnitudes and the swings, because I would think it\u2019s not as severe as it was let\u2019s say in April.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, it\u2019s bounced back pretty significantly. And what we\u2019ve seen is, as states have begun to open up, the base testing has increased. And for the first time, if you look at our base testing plus our COVID-19 testing in June, we actually had volume that was above the year. So, that just gives you a sense that the Base Business came back pretty well.\nJustin Bowers: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is now open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Adam, you talked and mentioned the flu a times during the call. Just hoping to get a little bit of sense of what you\u2019re expecting for the flu season, how it plays out, just given the current backdrop and what are your testing capabilities to sort of do both in one shot. And then practically speaking, could you just give us a sense of how big flu testing is for you and again whether you think there is an uptick there?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Ralph. Good morning. And what I would say is, if you look at this pandemic, the only thing that has been predictable is the fact that it\u2019s been unpredictable. And what we want to do is build as much capacity as fast as we can for any circumstance that comes at us come the fall flu season. When you look at the flu season, we think that this will probably be one of the highest years for people to get flu vaccinations. And we hope as many people that are able and that it\u2019s appropriate for it to get those vaccinations can do it. Our LabCorp Employer Services are actually helping businesses get vaccinations for flu for their employees. It\u2019s going to depend on the flu season, the strain, how effective those vaccines are. As you know, every year there\u2019s a different efficacy of the flu vaccine. So, we\u2019ll see how that plays out, based upon the strains. But under all circumstances, I think that COVID-19 together with the flu season is going to be more problematic than where we are today. We are developing combined tests of multiple respiratory ailments, including things like flu and COVID-19. Flu has not been a very significant driver of revenue for us in the past. But, I think with COVID-19, it\u2019s going to continue to be important to know is it flu or is it COVID-19? If somebody does a rapid flu test in a physician\u2019s office and it comes back negative and they saw symptoms, they\u2019re going to probably want to get the PCR test. If somebody comes back positive for flu in the office, I feel good about that, but I would still want to validate it in case it was a point-of-care false positive and get the PCR test. So that\u2019s why I believe under almost every circumstance, we\u2019ve got to be prepared and do everything we can to build as much capacity for the flu season.\nRalph Giacobbe: And then, just quick follow-up. I want to go to the pricing number ex-COVID, so just the base, I think was up almost 7% ex-PAMA and Beacon. Is that just all acuity driven, or what are the factors? And maybe what\u2019s a more sustainable number as we think we\u2019re going to have?\nGlenn Eisenberg: That\u2019s right. The mix impact on the Base Business was up 5.2%, but negatively impacted the 2% between PAMA and BeaconLBS. So, call it around 7%. Again, you\u2019ll notice that this time, we\u2019ve used the price mix to help define the revenues, so volume and price mix to get to our change in revenues. We have changed the methodology, as you would have seen in the past, using revenue per requisition, given that in the past that was always a good proxy, if you will for our pricing or our mix within the business. And what was interesting this quarter is we\u2019re trying to explain our, call it, 3.9% reduction in revenue, if you took our volume, change and our revenue per requisition change, you would get to minus 0.1. So this is really the first quarter that there\u2019s been a change, and that\u2019s just due to the dramatic decline in volumes that we\u2019ve experienced. So the rec number, if you will within the base would have been around 19.4%. So, the pricing overall within the Base Business, we always talk about it being that from a unit price is relatively stable. So normally where we see the change is normally in favorable mix. It could be test per session, it could be acquisition-related, but most of it\u2019s just driven off of test mix or potentially some payer mix as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions here, the first one on serology. So, Adam, maybe you can share your thoughts. What do you think serology testing guidelines could look like when the vaccine is available?\nAdam Schechter: Hey. Good morning, Ricky. The first thing I would say is that we\u2019ve built capacity in serology to a very significant degree. We can do 300,000 tests a day. We can do the total antibodies. We can look at the IgG, IgM, IgA. And I think that we\u2019ve done a really good job to get that up and running. There\u2019s really still information and science that we need to understand what those antibodies mean. So, we need to understand if you have the antibodies, are you immune? If you\u2019re immune, for how long does that last? If you have any antibodies, and they start to wane over time, will your T cells kick in if you\u2019re exposed to virus again, and you have an immune response? So, I would say that there\u2019s still more science that needs to be out there before we can give a definitive answer as to what they mean. But at a minimum, I would want to know if I had COVID-19 in the past, because I want to know that I beat it. So, if I have the antibodies, I would know that, I had COVID-19 in the past and I beat it. Number two, as you start to think about plasma an convalescence blood plasma and collecting that, you\u2019re going to want to know that people have antibodies in the plasma, so that if that works as a treatment, we can get plasma from as many people as possible. I think antibody testing is going to be important for that. Ultimately, I think you\u2019re going to need quantitative anybody testing that would say what level of anybodies you have. And I think that\u2019s going to be important. And we have a quantitative antibody test as well as a qualitative anybody test. So, at the end of the day, we\u2019re at the forefront of science on antibodies, on understanding T cells and other immune responses, but we still need more science and more research to give us the definitive answers.\nRicky Goldwasser: Okay. And then, on the PCR side. I mean, to your point, you said, we have 180,000 capacity but practical utilization is below that. So, when you think about current demand levels, to achieve that one to two days ideal turnaround, where does capacity need to be?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, Ricky, that\u2019s a big question. And as you go into the fall, I can\u2019t tell you the answer to that, because we don\u2019t know what the demand is going to be. And that\u2019s why we are building as much capacity as fast as we can. I have no constraints on buying machines and buying reagents. We\u2019re working with our suppliers who have been just terrific to work with to build whatever we need. And it would be a good day if we get through the fall and said, we have more capacity than what we needed. With regard to where we are today at 180,000, we\u2019re already -- for hospitalized patients, we\u2019re at about a day, day and a half turnaround. And then for everybody else, we\u2019re already, right now, as we speak at a two to three-day turnaround. So, we\u2019re doing really well in terms of turnaround. But we\u2019ve got to keep building because we don\u2019t know what the volume is going to be in the fall. And we won\u2019t rest until we build and build and build as much as we can.\nRicky Goldwasser: And just one follow-up. When you think about the volumes, what percent of the volumes are hospitals versus the rest on the COVID side?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. The hospital is small volume and over time it will get smaller. As there is more point-of-care tests available as it\u2019s more cartridges for point-of-care tests available, I think the hospitals will try to use those as much as possible, so as we do some point-of-care tests in our TSAs, which are the hospital labs that we manage. So for me, hospital inpatients point-of-care is critical. Right now, we have great turnaround. We\u2019re doing that as fast as we can for them, but if I was running a hospital and I can get an answer even faster, I want it even faster. So, it\u2019ll be a smaller percent as we go towards the future.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi. Good morning. So, I\u2019ve got a couple of questions on the lab. So, your competitor put out a low end of their fourth quarter guidance that basically implied a slowdown in molecular testing. I\u2019m just wondering your sort of thoughts on that scenario happening. Is that even something that\u2019s remotely possible? And then, some commentary on what you\u2019re hearing from the commercial payers in terms of how they\u2019re reimbursing? And then finally, have you looked at next generation sequencing as a way of increasing capacity? Is that something that you could potentially consider? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: So, what I would say is the reason that we have not provided guidance is because there are still so many unknowns as we go into the second half of the year. And the unknowns aren\u2019t just with PCR testing. It\u2019s also with the Base Business. Right now, the Base Business has come back very well. Will it remain that way, particularly if we have another significant COVID-19 impact in the fall? It\u2019s hard to know. I believe that COVID-19 testing until there\u2019s a vaccine they\u2019re going to need us to do as many as we can possibly do. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to build that capacity as quickly as we can. So, I don\u2019t see a scenario, except if there\u2019s a vaccine or some type of technology that I don\u2019t know of today that would impact us that would say we don\u2019t need a lot of PCR testing going throughout this year. In terms of next generation sequencing, absolutely, we\u2019re going to look at everything. The question is at what cost and what price point and how accurate will it be versus the PCR testing. And that kind of leads to your second question, which I put third, because I think commercial payers are going to look if they can get a very quick turnaround for an accurate test at a reasonable cost, it would do that versus other tests, unless there\u2019s a real scientific reason to do otherwise. So, what I can tell you, our scientists are looking at every technology available. Every time I read about one, or I see one, I send it to our scientists and they said, yes, we\u2019ve already talked to them, we\u2019ve already looked at it. So we\u2019ll be at the forefront of science and technology here. If it\u2019s something that makes sense, we\u2019re going to look at it and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to be a part of it, just like we\u2019ve done already with things like PacBio and Adaptive and so forth. But, as I sit here today, I think PCR testing as we go into the fall is going to be critical. And that\u2019s why we are so focused on trying to build capacity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Lawler from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nDan Lawler: Hi. Good morning. This is Dan Lawler for Matt Larew. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the demand for COVID tests on the Pixel platform. Can you give us a sense for what share of your COVID tests have been through the platform and then how meaningful Pixel self-collection might be from a back-to-school or return-to-work perspective? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, Pixel continues to be an important part and one of the many offerings that we have for people to get PCR testing. It is not a significant, meaning not more than 25% of our volume, it\u2019s less than that. But, we do see the Pixel volume increasing. And I do believe that as people go back to school or back to work, at-home collection kits will become more important. And that\u2019s why we have Pixel, but we also have other at-home collection kits outside of Pixel that we will use for both, mailings and for things like employers. So, I do believe it will become a more important piece of our mix. Even though we\u2019re moving a lot of them today, there\u2019ll be more as we go into the future.\nDan Lawler: Great. Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: You\u2019re welcome. Okay.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, in close, our mission to improve health and improve lives demands that we stay at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. The importance and the urgency of what we do has never been more clear. And our ability and our ability to support important scientific advances are unwavering. And we will only continue to strengthen it as we move into the future. So, I want to thank everyone for their support as we navigate the crisis, including our customers, our suppliers, and especially employees, we\u2019re all in this together. Have a good day. Stay safe. Wear your mask and donate plasma.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. For more than 50 years, LabCorp has led through science, innovation and technology. During the current pandemic, that leadership has been front and center, when the world has needed us most. I continue to be impressed with how quickly our teams have rallied to confront each and every challenge put before them. And I want to thank our 65,000 employees as their efforts have been heroic during this difficult time. During the second quarter, we delivered solid performance across the Company, despite the impact of the pandemic. We delivered revenue of $2.8 billion, adjusted EPS of $2.57 and free cash flow of $272 million. We were encouraged to see steady recovery in our Base Business during the quarter for both diagnostic and drug development, as people are starting to return to their doctors for testing and clinical trials activity is resuming, including those that are for COVID-19 related research. Hi, Eric. Good morning. So, Covance had a very good quarter. And I think it continues to show the power of having both, diagnostics and drug development together. If you look, we had put together a enterprise-only response team. And that team includes people from both, our diagnostics business and our scientists from diagnostics together with people and scientists from drug development. And we've been participating in discussions on almost every vaccine and almost every treatment for COVID-19. With that said, as I mentioned in my script, most of those trials are still pretty early stage. So for the quarter, they didn't necessarily contribute a very significant amount of dollars. As we move forward, I believe that it will be increasingly important in terms of our revenue. If you look at the three parts of our business, our early development and central laboratories began to come back quicker than the clinical work. And that's because if, for example, we have a central lab in China, as China opened up, we saw the capacity fill pretty fast. And as markets opened where we have the central laboratories, we've seen those countries continue to increase with the capacity that we have, quickly. Early development, we continue to do very well and that includes some of the early work that I just mentioned for COVID-19. Clinical, we have seen an increase in accessibility of sites, and that's gone up fairly significantly, particularly driven by Asia. Although there's not as many sites in Asia, as there are in the U.S. and Europe, most of the sites in Asia are now accessible. However, many companies are still waiting until there's global accessibility before starting some of those particularly later stage Phase 3 trials, and I think that's still going to take some time. So that business coming back has taken longer than the other two. Yes. So, I am not going to give you the exact percent, because it's a book-to-bill, as you can imagine, it moves based upon what makes it through Phase 1 and to Phase 2 and so forth. But we're not that dependent on COVID-19 trials at the moment. So, I can compare to their numbers, but our numbers are not as dependent upon COVID. Sure. Absolutely. Good morning, Jack. So, the first thing I would say, it's been pretty remarkable how in early March we were doing 2,000 to 3,000 PCR tests per week. And here we are in the end of July and we're able to do 180,000 PCR tests per day. I mean, that's just astonishing. For people that understand the type of equipment that you need to run PCR tests, it's completely different than what you would need for blood tests, and we've had to build significant capacity. I believe that we have to continue to build capacity. We don't know for certain what the fall will bring. But, as schools open up, as businesses open up and as the fall flu season comes to fruition, I think we're going to continue to do more testing. And I do believe that PCR testing will remain the gold standard for telling if somebody currently has the disease. And therefore, we will continue to build the past feet as fast as we can and overcome some of the issues that we face in terms of supplies and machinery. At the same time, I think that all testing is going to play a role. Pool testing is particularly helpful in areas with low prevalence, in things like back-to-school or back-to-work because with low prevalence, you can do the pool testing and then you don't have to do any retesting. I don't think it's going to be the most significant amount of testing that we're doing. In fact, I believe that the standard PCR testing in the fall will remain the most significant by far of the testing that we do for PCR. But, I do think that the pool testing will add to our capacity and give us additional capabilities. Things like antigen testing, I think have a role also. So for example, if you wanted to test a large group of people with antigen testing, point-of-care, get quick answers, you could then see if there's any positive people in that large group. If there are, I would go back and test them with PCR testing. If there's none, I would probably feel pretty comfortable that I don't have to retest. The issue with the antigen testing has been today is that you can miss some positives. So, you want to make sure if you have somebody positive, you test the people that tested negative. But if it's a pretty population, it would be a statistical anomaly for everybody to test falsely negative. So if you see one positive in that population, I would go back and retest them with PCR. So, I think we're going to need all the capacity we can get to get through the fall, assuming that the flu season could be big, and we're all doing the best we can to prepare for it. Yes. So, I'll give you a broad statement. I'll ask Glenn to give you some specifics. But, we're going to continue to build capacity irrespective of cost, and that's been our philosophy from the beginning. Buy as many machines as we can, get as much testing equipment as we can. And frankly, that's what got us to 180,000 per day, along with our scientific capabilities. The LabCorp's scientists have just been extraordinary to get us where we are today. And I want to continue to build that. It will be a good day if we get to fall and we have more capacity than the number of samples that we get in. And that's what we're going to strive for, albeit it's not going to be easy. We need help from our suppliers. We are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to try to get more reagents, more machines and so forth. But, in terms of the margins, I'll let Glenn give you some specifics. Yes. Thank you, Stephen. The first thing I'd say is that we launched back in March with our LDT, and that's a laboratory developed test by LabCorp's scientists. And it's been remarkable, the amount of volume that we've been able to do through that LDT. Of course, we still need our suppliers and the other companies to help us to get to 180,000. But I have to say that our scientists did an extraordinary job with the LDT to get up to 180,000 today. I'm not going to give you the exact number through the LDT because that changes. It changes based upon we have 16 labs running tests, different labs have the LDT, different labs have other equipment. So, at the end of the day, it depends on where the samples are, which tests we run them. And what we try to do is optimize our network, so we can get the best possible turnaround we can. To be at two to three days right now, turn around for patients and the hospital inpatient even faster says that we've found a real way to use our capacity and distribute it successfully. With regards to the pool tests, I don't think that we want to give a certain percent that will go through that. Instead, what I would say is we're going to make sure that as much of our LDT that is a significant amount of our volume, it's a significant amount, and go through that if we need it. At the same time, we'll have to file EUAs to use other platforms, to run the pooled analysis on, and we would expect to do that as we move forward. But for now, I think with our LDT, we can do as much pooling as what we would deem appropriate. Sure. Good morning, Lisa. And, it was interesting because in the first quarter, when we saw the volumes up by 55% in the month of March, we didn't know how fast it would come back. And there was a concern that it could take an extended period of time. To be Frank with you, I've been surprised at how fast it has come back. As states have opened, we've seen the testing come back more significantly. For example, as Florida and Texas and Georgia opened up first, we saw the core testing come back faster. As states begin to modulate and slow down a little bit, you see the testing slow down. So, there's definitely a correlation between how far and how fast the states have opened and how far and how fast our Base Businesses has come back. What I would say is, for June, it was the first time since COVID that we saw that the total testing including our COVID testing was above prior year. In July, it's still early, we don't have all the data for the month, but we're seeing continued strength in the Base Business in base testing. The reason that we have not giving guidance for the rest of the year is because as we say, it's impossible to know how fast states will move, will they slow down a little bit, if they see additional breakout? What will the fall look like? What could happen? Will it be another slowdown to the Base Business? So, we're watching it, I mean, frankly, almost every day. But, we want to make sure that we continue to do the best we can to be able to forecast that. In terms of reimbursement, they did announce, HHS that they extended the emergency in the United States. Typically, that lasts for another 90 days. We assume that the reimbursement will continue to be strong as we go through the emergency situation, and then we'll just have to see what happens as we go after that 9-day extension. Yes. Sure, Dan. Good morning. The first thing I would say is that, I spend a lot of time talking to other CEOs, talking to presidents of universities, and we try to help them understand ways that they can think about going back to work or back-to-school, and different companies and universities are thinking about different approaches. And sometimes it depends on if they're in a hotspot, if they're in an area of very low prevalence, what type of workforce they have, their healthcare workers, do they have factory workers? So, a lot of things go into the discussion and it's a multi-variant discussion. In general, the first thing that we talked about is the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, ensuring the work place is clean, good hygiene, cleaning elevators and elevator bottoms, ensuring the air flow in the buildings are appropriate. Prevention and keeping people out of work that are sick, having temperature checks before they come into school or work, questionnaires, that's all critical. The second thing is that, once somebody does make it into school or workplace and has any symptoms, you want to test them with PCR as quickly as possible, and you want to have tracking and tracing capabilities and be able to track and trace anybody that's been around them. And then, you want to have a place to isolate them, particularly if you're in a university while you wait for the results to come back. And that's why having the type of turnaround that we do two to three days is so important for tracking and tracing. And then, ultimately, over time, we want to work with them to get flu vaccinations for their workforce, so that when they get to the fall flu season, they'll have a sense as to what is flu versus what might be COVID-19. So, we're trying to work with these companies across the entire upfront of what they can be thinking about as they go into the August, September timeframe. What I can say is a lot of my time is spent on talking them how them doing testing because the types of testing people have said is, why don't I test everybody once a week? I don't think that makes a lot of sense to do that. I think, if they want to do surveillance, that's fine. But to try to test everybody once a week that'll give you one point in time. And the next day, if somebody is sick and starts to spread it, you won't necessarily have done a lot. You've spent a lot of money on testing that probably was not the best use of your time and money. So, to be honest with you, I spend a lot of time trying to help them think about it logically, and a lot of my time is trying to make them understand how to best use testing and where it's appropriate. And I can tell you, I'm spending a lot of my time and my team is spending a lot of time talking to these folks. Yes. I would say we're seeing increases and we're seeing business across all biopharma, pharma, large, small, U.S., ex-U.S. But, it's in the lines of business, like I mentioned to you earlier that we're seeing the business come back faster in early development, central laboratories, and over time as we will see more in the clinical area. But, I don't think there's a differentiation and segmentation across the customers within those segments. We're seeing strength frankly, and RFPs across them all. No, in general, we're not seeing any significant changes. Yes. Thanks for the question, Justin. And pooling is an important piece, but it's not, in my opinion going to be the primary piece. PCR testing will continue to be the primary piece of what we do. And if you look at our labs, we will not be rolling out pooling all of our labs. It takes a lot of technical capabilities to do the analysis, the analytics to hold the samples where you test the samples. It is a lot of work and you need some specialized equipment from it. So, we'll have it in multiple laboratories, but certainly not across all laboratories. And then, we have to make sure we use it in the right patient population. So, we're not going to just broadly start trying to pool patients. We're going to look for the right places and the right parts of the country or the right organizations where we believe the prevalence will be such that pooling makes sense. What I would avoid is, trying to go to theoretical capacity. And for example, right now, we can do 180,000 tests per day. We have done in a day, 180,000 tests and we know we can. But, I would not take 180,000 and times it by 7 and try to figure out capacity. Because if you can do 180,000, but you want to maintain a one to two-day or two to three-day turnaround, you don't want to run at full capacity. You want to be below that. So, we're going to continue to ensure that we do as many tests as we can, but we want to manage the turnaround time as best we can as well. So, to me, theoretical capacity is just that. But that's not how I build our financial model. I build it based upon practical utilization of the test, of which pooling will be a part of, but the overall PCR testing will drive it. Yes. So, it's bounced back pretty significantly. And what we've seen is, as states have begun to open up, the base testing has increased. And for the first time, if you look at our base testing plus our COVID-19 testing in June, we actually had volume that was above the year. So, that just gives you a sense that the Base Business came back pretty well. Yes. Thank you, Ralph. Good morning. And what I would say is, if you look at this pandemic, the only thing that has been predictable is the fact that it's been unpredictable. And what we want to do is build as much capacity as fast as we can for any circumstance that comes at us come the fall flu season. When you look at the flu season, we think that this will probably be one of the highest years for people to get flu vaccinations. And we hope as many people that are able and that it's appropriate for it to get those vaccinations can do it. Our LabCorp Employer Services are actually helping businesses get vaccinations for flu for their employees. It's going to depend on the flu season, the strain, how effective those vaccines are. As you know, every year there's a different efficacy of the flu vaccine. So, we'll see how that plays out, based upon the strains. But under all circumstances, I think that COVID-19 together with the flu season is going to be more problematic than where we are today. We are developing combined tests of multiple respiratory ailments, including things like flu and COVID-19. Flu has not been a very significant driver of revenue for us in the past. But, I think with COVID-19, it's going to continue to be important to know is it flu or is it COVID-19? If somebody does a rapid flu test in a physician's office and it comes back negative and they saw symptoms, they're going to probably want to get the PCR test. If somebody comes back positive for flu in the office, I feel good about that, but I would still want to validate it in case it was a point-of-care false positive and get the PCR test. So that's why I believe under almost every circumstance, we've got to be prepared and do everything we can to build as much capacity for the flu season. Hey. Good morning, Ricky. The first thing I would say is that we've built capacity in serology to a very significant degree. We can do 300,000 tests a day. We can do the total antibodies. We can look at the IgG, IgM, IgA. And I think that we've done a really good job to get that up and running. There's really still information and science that we need to understand what those antibodies mean. So, we need to understand if you have the antibodies, are you immune? If you're immune, for how long does that last? If you have any antibodies, and they start to wane over time, will your T cells kick in if you're exposed to virus again, and you have an immune response? So, I would say that there's still more science that needs to be out there before we can give a definitive answer as to what they mean. But at a minimum, I would want to know if I had COVID-19 in the past, because I want to know that I beat it. So, if I have the antibodies, I would know that, I had COVID-19 in the past and I beat it. Number two, as you start to think about plasma an convalescence blood plasma and collecting that, you're going to want to know that people have antibodies in the plasma, so that if that works as a treatment, we can get plasma from as many people as possible. I think antibody testing is going to be important for that. Ultimately, I think you're going to need quantitative anybody testing that would say what level of anybodies you have. And I think that's going to be important. And we have a quantitative antibody test as well as a qualitative anybody test. So, at the end of the day, we're at the forefront of science on antibodies, on understanding T cells and other immune responses, but we still need more science and more research to give us the definitive answers. Yes. So, Ricky, that's a big question. And as you go into the fall, I can't tell you the answer to that, because we don't know what the demand is going to be. And that's why we are building as much capacity as fast as we can. I have no constraints on buying machines and buying reagents. We're working with our suppliers who have been just terrific to work with to build whatever we need. And it would be a good day if we get through the fall and said, we have more capacity than what we needed. With regard to where we are today at 180,000, we're already -- for hospitalized patients, we're at about a day, day and a half turnaround. And then for everybody else, we're already, right now, as we speak at a two to three-day turnaround. So, we're doing really well in terms of turnaround. But we've got to keep building because we don't know what the volume is going to be in the fall. And we won't rest until we build and build and build as much as we can. Yes. The hospital is small volume and over time it will get smaller. As there is more point-of-care tests available as it's more cartridges for point-of-care tests available, I think the hospitals will try to use those as much as possible, so as we do some point-of-care tests in our TSAs, which are the hospital labs that we manage. So for me, hospital inpatients point-of-care is critical. Right now, we have great turnaround. We're doing that as fast as we can for them, but if I was running a hospital and I can get an answer even faster, I want it even faster. So, it'll be a smaller percent as we go towards the future. So, what I would say is the reason that we have not provided guidance is because there are still so many unknowns as we go into the second half of the year. And the unknowns aren't just with PCR testing. It's also with the Base Business. Right now, the Base Business has come back very well. Will it remain that way, particularly if we have another significant COVID-19 impact in the fall? It's hard to know. I believe that COVID-19 testing until there's a vaccine they're going to need us to do as many as we can possibly do. And that's why we're going to build that capacity as quickly as we can. So, I don't see a scenario, except if there's a vaccine or some type of technology that I don't know of today that would impact us that would say we don't need a lot of PCR testing going throughout this year. In terms of next generation sequencing, absolutely, we're going to look at everything. The question is at what cost and what price point and how accurate will it be versus the PCR testing. And that kind of leads to your second question, which I put third, because I think commercial payers are going to look if they can get a very quick turnaround for an accurate test at a reasonable cost, it would do that versus other tests, unless there's a real scientific reason to do otherwise. So, what I can tell you, our scientists are looking at every technology available. Every time I read about one, or I see one, I send it to our scientists and they said, yes, we've already talked to them, we've already looked at it. So we'll be at the forefront of science and technology here. If it's something that makes sense, we're going to look at it and we're going to do everything we can to be a part of it, just like we've done already with things like PacBio and Adaptive and so forth. But, as I sit here today, I think PCR testing as we go into the fall is going to be critical. And that's why we are so focused on trying to build capacity. Yes. So, Pixel continues to be an important part and one of the many offerings that we have for people to get PCR testing. It is not a significant, meaning not more than 25% of our volume, it's less than that. But, we do see the Pixel volume increasing. And I do believe that as people go back to school or back to work, at-home collection kits will become more important. And that's why we have Pixel, but we also have other at-home collection kits outside of Pixel that we will use for both, mailings and for things like employers. So, I do believe it will become a more important piece of our mix. Even though we're moving a lot of them today, there'll be more as we go into the future. You're welcome. Okay. Yes. So, in close, our mission to improve health and improve lives demands that we stay at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. The importance and the urgency of what we do has never been more clear. And our ability and our ability to support important scientific advances are unwavering. And we will only continue to strengthen it as we move into the future. So, I want to thank everyone for their support as we navigate the crisis, including our customers, our suppliers, and especially employees, we're all in this together. Have a good day. Stay safe. Wear your mask and donate plasma."

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with the review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with some commentary regarding our current expectations for the remainder of 2020. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we were able to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our results, given that the impact was late in the quarter. However, we commented that we would not be able to do that going forward. For second quarter results, we have quantified the revenue associated with the COVID-19 molecular and serology tests, so that you can see the change in the Base Business. Sure. Jack, we've commented in the past that when we -- obviously given the fixed cost nature of the diagnostics business, the incremental dropdown for new testing, call it was around 65%. So, we've used that example when there's been weather and what's happened. So, the COVID testing clearly falls within the ballpark, if you will, of what we would have experienced with our other testing. So, obviously, helping contribute to the improved leverage, if you will, with the additional testing that we're doing. Hi, Don. It's Glenn. Yes. As you mentioned, the first quarter, given the pandemic coming and looking back at other times where we're seeing significant financial disruption and how it impacted our client base, we established a reserve of $17 million. We have seen an increase in our bad debt experience, but we feel that the reserves that we have established are very adequate going forward and nothing that was unexpected, at least at this time. That's right. The mix impact on the Base Business was up 5.2%, but negatively impacted the 2% between PAMA and BeaconLBS. So, call it around 7%. Again, you'll notice that this time, we've used the price mix to help define the revenues, so volume and price mix to get to our change in revenues. We have changed the methodology, as you would have seen in the past, using revenue per requisition, given that in the past that was always a good proxy, if you will for our pricing or our mix within the business. And what was interesting this quarter is we're trying to explain our, call it, 3.9% reduction in revenue, if you took our volume, change and our revenue per requisition change, you would get to minus 0.1. So this is really the first quarter that there's been a change, and that's just due to the dramatic decline in volumes that we've experienced. So the rec number, if you will within the base would have been around 19.4%. So, the pricing overall within the Base Business, we always talk about it being that from a unit price is relatively stable. So normally where we see the change is normally in favorable mix. It could be test per session, it could be acquisition-related, but most of it's just driven off of test mix or potentially some payer mix as well."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. . Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. .  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Clarissa Willett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nClarissa Willett: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to LabCorp's First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this call available via telephone and internet.  With me today are Adam Schechter, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning in the Investor Relations section of our website at labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an investor relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.  Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements with respect to expectations for 2020 and the related assumptions, including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company\u2019s businesses, operating results, cash flows and our financial conditions, our responses to and the expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business more generally, as well as on general economics, business and market conditions.  Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any update to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now, I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. These are certainly unprecedented times in which we've been living and working as a result of the global pandemic. Every country, government, customer, shareholders and employee has been impacted by these turbulent times and LabCorp is no exception.  Given our unique role across the spectrum of diagnostic testing and drug development, we have risen to the challenge to help combat the virus. We are supporting the protection of both, those who are currently or previously infected by the virus and we're involved in the development of potential treatments and vaccines.  Our teams like many who are directly involved in fighting this pandemic, have been working around the clock, and they remain energized by all that we are doing to minimize the impact in the United States and around the world. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments by discussing the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, and then provide some details on our first quarter results. While we're not providing specific guidance today for the year, I'll provide some commentary on our current assumptions and expectations for the remainder of 2020.  As Adam noted, our combined diagnostics and drug development offering uniquely enables us to help combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, by supporting the detection of the virus through diagnostic testing, as well as the development of treatments. While we continue to play a critical role in combating this pandemic, COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the performance of both of our businesses, albeit at different magnitude and in different ways. In our diagnostics business, at the end of the quarter, we experienced reductions in demand for testing a 50% to 55% versus the company's normal daily levels. This reduction in demand impacted testing volume broadly, but with a more heavily weighted towards routine procedures. It also impacted esoteric tests, but to a lesser degree due to the critical and time sensitive nature of these test results.  In addition, while we\u2019ve ramped up capacity for COVID-19 tests, the impact of the new volume has only marginally offset the lower volume we're experiencing with our broader test offering. While not impacting the quarter, we are also focused on increasing capacity of our new COVID-19 serology antibody tests of over 200,000 per day by mid-May, along with the increasing capacity of COVID-19 at-home test kit offering. \nOperator: Thank you, sir. . Our first question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Good morning and thanks very much. Adam, thank you for all that your team is doing on the front lines of these difficult times. I just really want to understand just a couple of things. As we think about the testing volume for both COVID-19 as well as Serology, can you first talk about the expectations around reimbursement?  And then secondly, I know that you\u2019ve pulled guidance, but with the anticipation of $200,000 Serology tests today, how many tests do you expect that you can get on the molecular side, and do you think \u2013 I know you said you expected the number to be down this year, but is there an anticipation that potentially this testing volume could help to offset some of what you're seeing as far as traditional volumes?  And then just lastly, like when we think about volumes going into the back half of the year, what are your expectations around kind of getting back to more normalization? Will that happen potentially by the time we get to the third or fourth quarter? I know that's a lot of questions in one, but I just wanted to kind of understand how you think about these volumes. \nA - Adam Schechter: Yes sure. Good morning Lisa and I'll probably think \u2013 you know I've been involved with LabCorp now for six years and I began as CEO in November, and you know when an organization is pushed to the limits, you really learn a lot about the organization. And the people of LabCorp work so hard and are doing so much and care about their work in a remarkable way, and just you can get to see the heart and the soul of an organization and what I've seen is just amazing and I'm just very impressed with the people that I'm working with, the scientists, the front line workers, the phlebotomists, the carriers. The people that are building up capacity have just been outstanding, so I'm just \u2013 it's a pleasure for me to be able to work with such great people. With regard to testing, let me try to give you some background of where we are and where I see things going. So it was just about 45 days ago that we began testing. We're able to do several thousand tests a day. Right now we can do about 60,000 tests a day. I\u2019m talking PCR testing first. I\u2019ll get to Serology in a moment, and we're going to continue to build that capacity.  I don't know the exact number that we\u2019ll be able to build to and how fast, but I would like to get over 100,000 tests per day as quickly as possible. The issue that you run into is you need additional machines and you can imagine there's lots of back orders and you know doing these RNA tests and the PCR test takes a lot of equipment. But we're going to try to build to get to over 100,000 as quickly as we can.  The interesting thing is for a short period of time when we're doing thousands a today, we did have some back orders for several weeks. We no longer have any back orders and in fact we have some additional capacity, so we're not using all of our capacity at the 60,000 per day right now. I think that's just short term and I think as states become up and running and back to business, I think that we will be at full capacity in the very near future, which is why we're trying to build more and more capacity as quickly as we can. So I believe that the PCR testing will be running at capacity for quite some time.  With regard to serology, it's still very early and it's not easy to predict. I think there's still some debate frankly in the marketplace on how to utilize the serology test and the way in which to go about using serology. Right now we can go over 50,000 serology tests a day, but we'll be able to do well over 200,000 a day by the middle of next month.  I don't know how long it will take though in order for us to use all that capacity per day and I think that there's several reasons why. One is, as companies, particularly large companies are coming back to work, some of them were talking about serology tests and doing them in a large scale, while some of them are saying they don't see the need. In addition to that, I believe there will be other ways such as point-of-care serology tests and I don't know how they are going to be used in the marketplace.  My expectation is that we'll be able to use most of our serology capacity as we get into the summer months and into the fall and I just don't know how quickly that will ramp up, but I think we'll be able to find ways to probably utilize most of the serology testing as we move forward through the summer. With regard to that though, when you think about those numbers, over 200,000 tests today in serology and maybe 100,000 tests over time for PCR, it's still a very small number compared to the 530 million or so tests that we do a year ago across all of our testing. So unless we start to see that come back, it will be hard for these tests to make up for the difference in what we've seen at the last weeks of March. Now the good news is we are starting to see a little bit less of a decline as we go towards the end of this month, and as the country gets back up and running, I would expect we'll start to see less of a decline over the summer. And assuming that there's no additional impact in the fall of this year with another impact from the COVID-19 virus, I would expect that as we get towards the end of the year a lot of the volume will come back and they always come back to the fact that what we did before was important for health.  I am worried right now that a lot of people that need diagnostic testing are not getting what they need. Once they feel comfortable again to go outside of their home, I believe they will start to go back for the diagnostic testing like they had in the past. Hopefully I\u2019ve answered your questions Lisa. Thank you.\nLisa Gill: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. I just want to continue on the serology testing. I mean do you have any expectation of pricing at this point and timing of when CMS is going to release the rate? And then, is it your expectation that commercial rates are going to mirror those for serology and have insurers come up and match a $100 molecular test. Thanks. \nA - Adam Schechter: Yes, so let me start with the molecular testing. So molecular test, the reimbursed rate by Medicare is about \u2013 is $100, and that\u2019s what we charge all customers, $100. We're trying to in this pandemic and time of need, we're looking for a consistency and we\u2019re charging a consistent pricing across the market place.  We don't have a Medicare price yet for the serology testing. I'm not saying for certainty that that will be our price that we charge all customers, but if you look at what we've done with the PCR testing, that's something that I'll be looking at very, very closely. Again, I want to make sure that we're seeing and doing everything we can in this pandemic to help in every way which we can, and I think that we should know something hopefully in the next days, certainly not more than a week or so I would expect. \nOperator: Thank you. I see our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Thank you. Good morning! I like to talk a little bit about the CRO. Have you seen any cancellation yet in anything and how the three segments are performing from a demand and disruption standpoint. The level of work that you can continue, any sort of visibility around that, you can break it down by the three CRO segments and maybe when you expect to get some activity ramping back up as the year progresses. \nAdam Schechter: Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So a couple of things here. First one, with regard to cancellations, in the first quarter we saw about the same number of cancellations that we would expect to see in any quarter. So we didn't see an acceleration of cancellations.  With regard to the overall CRO business, you know we continue to have growth despite COVID-19 in the first quarter, but obviously towards the end of the quarter we started to see a significant impact of people postponing trials. Interestingly that business started to be impacted a little bit earlier than the end of March, because we do have a dental laboratory business in China. The impact there was earlier than the United States and we've actually seen our business in China start to pick up as China has begun to open up.  But what I look at more than the segments and the timing of them coming back, because they will come back, is what's happening in the marketplace right now and I mentioned that if you look at the COVID-19 trials, whether it would be for vaccines, whether it be central laboratory work or it be early stage development for antiviral, we are winning more than our share would predict. In fact, almost twice the amount of studies as a percent that what you would have expected on the share. I think that's truly demonstrates the power of the combined.  When I watch what our teams are doing and our diagnostic teams are joining our drug development team in conversations with clients, and even with our diagnostic teams, our drug development teams are coming into the diagnostic discussions to help understand what is being done in the marketplace and the studies that are underway, we are really starting to see significant advantage of having both the diagnostics and drug development business.  Now most of the trials are pre-clinical or Phase I. Even there we\u2019re winning more than our fair share of market, but what I wanted to say is that those vaccines and those antivirals going to Phase II and Phase III, that we continue to win above what our market share would suggest. So I'm excited about the long term prospects for certain. I'm seeing the power combined.  How quickly the business comes back is going to be determined as to some extent how quickly markets around the world open up, particularly for the Phase III clinical trials, because most of those are global clinical trials. But I would say that we are optimistic that the world needed what we did before this and certainly with what's happening today in the trials for COVID-19, I think our capabilities are needed even more so in the future. \nKevin Caliendo: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard : Thank you. So trying to understand the organic volume growth trend in the quarter in your lab business and in the disparity versus your large competitor. Can you comment on maybe any share dynamics in the quarter and were there any lingering headwinds from the expanded managed care access for your competitor or has that all annualized at this point? Thank you. \nAdam Schechter: Yeah, I\u2019ll give some context and I\u2019ll ask Glenn if he wants to just jump in. But you know basically you saw our decline of between 50% to 55% towards the end of the quarter in terms of volume in the last several weeks of March, and we've seen that kind of level off, and I'd say in the last couple of weeks we've actually seen it begin to come back a little bit.  We saw a little bit of a change in mix as well that the esoteric testing did not decline as fast as the overall testing did and that's not a surprise, because esoteric testing typically is more in severe diseases and so forth. That's a little bit of why you saw an increase in our average price for the quarter, it\u2019s because the esoteric business held a bit stronger than the typical regular diagnostic business.  But as we go forward we would expect both businesses to begin to pick up and assuming that the country begins to come back to work and as we get to the summer, there's no additional impact in the fall season, I would expect both esoteric and the other diagnostic tests to come back to somewhat normal as we get through the end of the year. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah. Dan I guess I\u2019ll just add too. When you look at our normalized level of organic volume, it was pretty consistent with where we've been, at roughly around 1.3% when you take out the unusuals if you will.  So as Adam said, obviously backing out the impact of COVID, which we said was around a 7.3% impact, then we had three other kind of discrete items, two that were positive. So we benefited from the half of revenue day and that was around 0.7% benefits to our volume growth and then we had favorable weather compared to a year ago of around 0.8%. But that was offset effectively by lower consumer genetics demand at 1.6%.  So effectively a 1.3% for us has been kind of where we track it. Obviously it improved over the fourth quarter, but kind of where we would expect to track and I know you mentioned our competitor. We do talk about them and we do treat the treatment of volume differently for our lab management fees, which would have added around 60 basis points. So we feel really good that the base business from a demand standpoint, a volume standpoint, it's been pretty consistent.  What we've also been very pleased about, that really impacts our revenues even more is on the price side you know and while overall our pricing here we would say is relatively flat, the mix impact really was nice. So again in a similar vein, while we simply show kind of organic pricing at around a 3.4% increase, we had a couple of headwinds and tailwinds.  You know we benefited from \u2013 as Adam said from COVID where we have the lower percentage impacted from the esoteric tests, so it mixes this up. That helped us around 1.9%. Similarly with the lower consumer demand, consumer generics demand at a lower price point, that's helped our mix at 0.9% and then the headwind as we talked about already have PAMA and Beacon each at around 1.1%.  So again getting to a normalized price would get us to around a price mix of 2.8%, which actually is tracked higher than what we've done over the past year, you know in line, call it with the last couple of quarters where we\u2019ve been north of two, but we continue to see favorable price mix. So from a revenue standpoint, again excluding COVID, we thought we had actually a very strong quarter. \nDan Leonard : Yeah, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from BOA. Please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So I just wanted to go back on the testing site for COVID. So we have seen estimates from anywhere from the need for 500,000 molecular test days and up on that one. I'm just sort of curious in terms of what sort of capacity, expectations or need expectations you're planning for and you're looking for and sort of how you think about that. This sort of goes into a question about, your ultimate share and where you can get it, so the first part of that question is one, on what you think the ultimate testing need will be and how long the duration of that is?  And the follow-up on that one is going to be something similar for serology. I mean there's clearly a lot more serology capacity in the U.S. than there is molecular, and I'm just sort of curious on how you sort of see demand for that market evolving going forward, just getting there are so many more players that can do serology testing? Thank you. \nAdam Schechter: Yeah, hi Derik. A couple of thoughts. First of all, if you look at the overall capacity needed for PCR testing, which is testing to tell if a person actually has the virus, is actively shedding the virus, it's impossible to know the exact number that you need across the United States. I would say right now if you look at what's been done over 5 million tests, that\u2019s pretty significant. I just said that we could do today 1.8 million tests per month and we're going to try to increase that if we can get 100,000 tests or greater a day, alone we could do 2.5 million a month.  And then you would add in all the other commercial labs, the state labs, the local labs, the academic medical centers. I think there's going to be a very significant amount of capacity that at least we'll get people through stage one of what the White House Coronavirus Task force is recommending to get states up and running.  At the same time, we're going to all continue to build capacity, because until there's a vaccine, I think we're going to have to have the ability to continue to do testing to see who have the virus. And I think that type of testing will continue even when there's a treatment up until there is a vaccine.  Separate and distinct from that of the serology, which is to tell who has been exposed to the virus in the past, and scientifically frankly there is still a lot of discussion on what's the most appropriate way to use the serology testing. For surveillance, I think it's going to be used for a long time.  I also believe that as businesses get up and running, they are going to test large parts of the population for serology tests and I believe if somebody tests positive for serology, meaning that they had been exposed to a virus in the past, but probably need a second test in order to validate that wasn't a false positive.  And then, the question becomes how often if somebody who's negative to serology get tested? Is it every three months, every six months, and I don't think that there's any known recommendation at this time.  The good news for us for serology is it\u2019s a blood test, and we run blood tests all the time. We know how to run a blood test and we're going to build as much capacity as we can, we\u2019ll utilize as much of that capacity as we can, but at the same time a lot of those will be run on the machines that we run our typical blood tests on anyway.  So I think for us it's a matter of build as much as you can, see how the science plays out, see how the marketplace plays out, and just be prepared for whatever volume you may need. \nDerik de Bruin : Thank you. \nAdam Schechter: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nErin Wright : Great! Thanks. I have a couple of questions on Covance. Do you \u2013 I guess what percentage of the sites would you consider offline or inaccessible right now? And what percentage of that clinical trial work do you anticipate will convert to more virtual, at-home or remote monitoring?  And then a second part to that would be, how many of these COVID-19 trials have you won and do you anticipate those trials to actually be material from a financial perspective? Others I guess in the industry have downside contribution from this COVID trial? Thank. \nAdam Schechter: Yeah, okay I\u2019m going to start with your last question first, and I\u2019ll answer the other one. So first of all, if you look at the COVID-19 trials, whether they be for antivirals or they be the things that we're doing with a company like PacBio or Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, you know most of them are early stage, smaller trials. So we are winning, I said more than twice our market share would expect us to win, but they are still relatively small times. They are early stage, preclinical or Phase I.  As those progress, I would expect that we would win more than our fair share in Phase II and Phase III and then I believe they become much more meaningful in terms of dollars. Right now they are meaningful because it really is demonstrating the power of having a diagnostic capability combined with drug development capability.  Separate and distinct from that with regard to sites up and running, we think it's that \u2013 about 70% to 80% of sites are not up and running at the moment for clinical trials. At the same time we are working hard, because we have made significant advances in hybrid and virtual clinical trials, and I think as the trails come back, there will be even greater utilization for things like hybrid and virtual trials. So we'll continue to work with our pharmaceutical and biotechnology colleagues to help them get their trials up and running as quickly as possible.\nErin Wright : Thank you. \nOperator: . Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah hi! Good morning, and thank you for all the details. A question on reimbursement of the PCR. Obviously CMS raised reimbursements were $51 to $100. But what are your thoughts as testing expense and we shift to Phase II and Phase III. Do you anticipate the reimbursement is going to stay at those levels or as volumes pick up and the testing guidance is relaxed that we are going to see changes to the price metric? \nGlenn Eisenberg: So thank you for the question Ricky. Right now the Medicare price is $100 and that's been our price and our philosophy on pricing, which is to use the Medicare price, which they take a lot of time, spend a lot of effort to think through what is appropriate. And therefore we have charged all customers at that price. I have no reason to believe that that price would change, based upon anything I know today.  And I think that the testing for PCR will continue to grow, but the importance of it, it makes it very cost effective to test patients and actually find out who has the disease and then isolate them, so others don't get the disease. So I think it\u2019s a very cost effective way in order to insure that you do everything you can. At the same time I would say that the capital expense and the difficulty of PCR is pretty high, and doing the PCR testing is not simple. I mean it's an RNA extraction that has multiple steps. So I feel like the reimbursement where it is today is at a good rate. \nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nStephen Baxter: Hey, good morning, and thanks for all the color you guys provided today. I was hoping to get a little more insight into the increase in accounts receivable allowance that you guys mention during the prepared remarks. Have you stated to actually see anything yet in terms of your ability to collect on copays and deductibles in the lab side of the business?  And just in terms of what this charge actually represent, is this covering you know Q1 days of service, you know some wider range of time. And then how are you thinking, you are expecting this to play out kind of throughout the balance of the year. And is this going to be an item that you continue to exclude from earnings for the balance of the year? Thank you. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, this is Glenn. I\u2019d say you know as we look at our reserves for receivables, you know we looked obviously back at prior recessions and big events that occurred in the USSA with the high unemployment rates, the impact that it's having on our customers if you will. Our expectation is that business that we've already conducted, that we currently have as receivables outstanding, we\u2019ve assessed that full amount and have taken kind of a one-time charge or one-time reserve relative to those receivables. We\u2019ll obviously still look to go and collect on them, but it's based upon historical experiences we feel that's an appropriate level to build the reserve for that.  So as we go forward, we have a normal standard process every quarter. We assess the adequacy of all of our reserves. So at this point we would say we're fully reserved based on what we believe and then if anything changes in the future, we\u2019ll adjusted that, but our expectation is that the reserves that we established are adequate to deal with the environment that we're operating in. \nStephen Baxter: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Larew from William Blair. Please go ahead. \nDan Lawler : Hi, good morning. This is Dan Lawler on for Matt Larew. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the initial demand that you're seeing for your at-home COVID tests and whether or not you think COVID-19 could be a catalyst for you ramp-up Pixel over the long term? Thanks. \nAdam Schechter: Yeah, hi Dan, thanks for the message. And you know we announced the launch of our Pixel by LabCorp at-home tests for COVID-19 about a week ago, and we're focused right now on frontline healthcare workers and first responders that have symptoms. And you know we've seen the demand is pretty significant in terms of not only people that are going to our website, but other people that are trying to reach out and see when it'll be available more broadly to additional people outside of those subgroups. So I do believe that this may be a reason that Pixel continues to grow over time as we go into the future.  At the same time we do plan to launch Pixel to additional groups of people as we get through the next weeks and I would expect right now we have over 100,000 kits available that will continue to make that much you know as we look out into the future on a weekly to every other week basis. \nDan Lawler : Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird. Please go ahead. \nMichael Polark: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to get a bit more detail on the goodwill impairment. Glenn, I think you mentioned it relates predominantly to one of the reporting units and drug development. What piece of the Covance business took the impairment and I guess more context around why a lot of companies are viewing the COVID disruption as a transitory influence? I was a little surprised to see a permanent impairment charge taken. Any color on this topic would be helpful. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure Michael. It is kind of an interesting exercise given that these are point in time. So as you recall in our 10-K, we commented that we did have one of the reporting units within drug development that was relatively close, fair value versus the book value, and that was performed as we do all of our reporting units, you know based upon September 30 and we report that on it for the year. But when we bring it to our kind of outside firm that does our valuations, it\u2019s based upon a point in time.  And so what's interesting that's happened is now we move forward to March 31 where we've now done it again, and obviously the business has been impacted by COVID and a lot of others, but we look at the valuations or they look at valuations, based upon DCFs as well as just market valuations. And so interestingly when you look at the CRO market multiples, from September 30 through March 30, they are down 30%, and so we are effectively half of the valuations saying the value of the business is down 30% at that one point in time.  Frankly if we were to do it today, you know it would be a very different number, but accounting says you do it on that date and then also given the volatility in the market, you have the discount rate that was increased. So from their exercise on the value of the business on a particular day, you know that caused the decline at which we took the non-cash charge during the quarter. \nMichael Polark: Would you say it\u2019s equally spread across lab clinical early or was this related predominantly by Chiltern or Envigo or anything else that you could specifically call out. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure, effectively we have a lot of different reporting units, but the one reporting unit here that's broken out primarily relates to our clinical business. So that's the reporting unit, separate. And as you know when you look at even an acquisition and you break up the pieces to it, it doesn't necessarily say it's reflective of the total valuation of a company.  It's just the specific reporting unit that's broken out, as well as the specific goodwill that allocated to that business at that point in time, and so to your point you could say that within a year ago you acquired a business and you paid the market multiple for that business at that time.  Now all of a sudden you see a 30% correction, that business that you just bought is now theoretically worth 30% less. And accounting would say that\u2019s what you value it at that day, and then six months later you could be back-up to that same market multiple, the valuation goes back up, but you don't write it back up, it's just the convention. So you know just a confluence of events with COVID-19 impacting earnings, results of all the companies, as well as the market valuations resulted in the impairment charge. \nAdam Schechter: And the only thing I would add is strategically there is no doubt in my mind and we're seeing more and more evidence every day, particularly as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic, having the drug development business together with the diagnostic business was a great strategic move.  And I believe in the importance of the combined today as much if not more based upon what we're going through and what we're seeing than I did even before the virus. \nMichael Polark: I appreciate all the color. If I could sneak one more in on the CARES Act, the $56 million that you received I presume in April, will you carve that out of adjusted earnings for future reporting as a housekeeping item, and then do you expect any additional disbursements under the CARES Act? I know there was a second round of payments expected here in the very near term. Anything else you might anticipate to receive? \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, I\u2019d say obviously how we\u2019ll account for it you know we\u2019ll determine as we go through the quarterly and report. I think it's fair to say, given we've even done it now anything that is unusual, we will either call out separately or at least explaining the performance benefited from that. But clearly, to some extent a recoup if you will of the negative impact that we\u2019re being impacted by COVID, as well as the capital spend and other spend that we\u2019re making in order to ramp-up our testing as well. And while there are other tranches of the CARES Act that we could potentially be included in, at this stage it\u2019s just too early to tell what that would be and obviously once we have more clarity on that, we\u2019ll be able to convey that. \nAdam Schechter : Okay. So first of all thank you everybody for joining us today, and I have to say, I\u2019m so proud of the way our company is mobilized to serve patients, customers, our local communities and the world. LabCorp has been innovators in science and medicine to help address global needs and I am deeply grateful to the way in which our 65,000 employees have stepped up in every country around the world.  What we do matters, and I believe it matters more in the future than it did in the past, and I believe it mattered a lot in the past. The challenge is far from over, but as I said previously, I have no doubt that we can beat this virus and also that LabCorp will remain committed to our mission to improve health and improve lives as we move forward. So, thank you so much for joining the call today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. These are certainly unprecedented times in which we've been living and working as a result of the global pandemic. Every country, government, customer, shareholders and employee has been impacted by these turbulent times and LabCorp is no exception.  Given our unique role across the spectrum of diagnostic testing and drug development, we have risen to the challenge to help combat the virus. We are supporting the protection of both, those who are currently or previously infected by the virus and we're involved in the development of potential treatments and vaccines.  Our teams like many who are directly involved in fighting this pandemic, have been working around the clock, and they remain energized by all that we are doing to minimize the impact in the United States and around the world. Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So a couple of things here. First one, with regard to cancellations, in the first quarter we saw about the same number of cancellations that we would expect to see in any quarter. So we didn't see an acceleration of cancellations.  With regard to the overall CRO business, you know we continue to have growth despite COVID-19 in the first quarter, but obviously towards the end of the quarter we started to see a significant impact of people postponing trials. Interestingly that business started to be impacted a little bit earlier than the end of March, because we do have a dental laboratory business in China. The impact there was earlier than the United States and we've actually seen our business in China start to pick up as China has begun to open up.  But what I look at more than the segments and the timing of them coming back, because they will come back, is what's happening in the marketplace right now and I mentioned that if you look at the COVID-19 trials, whether it would be for vaccines, whether it be central laboratory work or it be early stage development for antiviral, we are winning more than our share would predict. In fact, almost twice the amount of studies as a percent that what you would have expected on the share. I think that's truly demonstrates the power of the combined.  When I watch what our teams are doing and our diagnostic teams are joining our drug development team in conversations with clients, and even with our diagnostic teams, our drug development teams are coming into the diagnostic discussions to help understand what is being done in the marketplace and the studies that are underway, we are really starting to see significant advantage of having both the diagnostics and drug development business.  Now most of the trials are pre-clinical or Phase I. Even there we're winning more than our fair share of market, but what I wanted to say is that those vaccines and those antivirals going to Phase II and Phase III, that we continue to win above what our market share would suggest. So I'm excited about the long term prospects for certain. I'm seeing the power combined.  How quickly the business comes back is going to be determined as to some extent how quickly markets around the world open up, particularly for the Phase III clinical trials, because most of those are global clinical trials. But I would say that we are optimistic that the world needed what we did before this and certainly with what's happening today in the trials for COVID-19, I think our capabilities are needed even more so in the future. Yeah, I'll give some context and I'll ask Glenn if he wants to just jump in. But you know basically you saw our decline of between 50% to 55% towards the end of the quarter in terms of volume in the last several weeks of March, and we've seen that kind of level off, and I'd say in the last couple of weeks we've actually seen it begin to come back a little bit.  We saw a little bit of a change in mix as well that the esoteric testing did not decline as fast as the overall testing did and that's not a surprise, because esoteric testing typically is more in severe diseases and so forth. That's a little bit of why you saw an increase in our average price for the quarter, it's because the esoteric business held a bit stronger than the typical regular diagnostic business.  But as we go forward we would expect both businesses to begin to pick up and assuming that the country begins to come back to work and as we get to the summer, there's no additional impact in the fall season, I would expect both esoteric and the other diagnostic tests to come back to somewhat normal as we get through the end of the year. Yeah, hi Derik. A couple of thoughts. First of all, if you look at the overall capacity needed for PCR testing, which is testing to tell if a person actually has the virus, is actively shedding the virus, it's impossible to know the exact number that you need across the United States. I would say right now if you look at what's been done over 5 million tests, that's pretty significant. I just said that we could do today 1.8 million tests per month and we're going to try to increase that if we can get 100,000 tests or greater a day, alone we could do 2.5 million a month.  And then you would add in all the other commercial labs, the state labs, the local labs, the academic medical centers. I think there's going to be a very significant amount of capacity that at least we'll get people through stage one of what the White House Coronavirus Task force is recommending to get states up and running.  At the same time, we're going to all continue to build capacity, because until there's a vaccine, I think we're going to have to have the ability to continue to do testing to see who have the virus. And I think that type of testing will continue even when there's a treatment up until there is a vaccine.  Separate and distinct from that of the serology, which is to tell who has been exposed to the virus in the past, and scientifically frankly there is still a lot of discussion on what's the most appropriate way to use the serology testing. For surveillance, I think it's going to be used for a long time.  I also believe that as businesses get up and running, they are going to test large parts of the population for serology tests and I believe if somebody tests positive for serology, meaning that they had been exposed to a virus in the past, but probably need a second test in order to validate that wasn't a false positive.  And then, the question becomes how often if somebody who's negative to serology get tested? Is it every three months, every six months, and I don't think that there's any known recommendation at this time.  The good news for us for serology is it's a blood test, and we run blood tests all the time. We know how to run a blood test and we're going to build as much capacity as we can, we'll utilize as much of that capacity as we can, but at the same time a lot of those will be run on the machines that we run our typical blood tests on anyway.  So I think for us it's a matter of build as much as you can, see how the science plays out, see how the marketplace plays out, and just be prepared for whatever volume you may need. Sure. Yeah, okay I'm going to start with your last question first, and I'll answer the other one. So first of all, if you look at the COVID-19 trials, whether they be for antivirals or they be the things that we're doing with a company like PacBio or Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, you know most of them are early stage, smaller trials. So we are winning, I said more than twice our market share would expect us to win, but they are still relatively small times. They are early stage, preclinical or Phase I.  As those progress, I would expect that we would win more than our fair share in Phase II and Phase III and then I believe they become much more meaningful in terms of dollars. Right now they are meaningful because it really is demonstrating the power of having a diagnostic capability combined with drug development capability.  Separate and distinct from that with regard to sites up and running, we think it's that \u2013 about 70% to 80% of sites are not up and running at the moment for clinical trials. At the same time we are working hard, because we have made significant advances in hybrid and virtual clinical trials, and I think as the trails come back, there will be even greater utilization for things like hybrid and virtual trials. So we'll continue to work with our pharmaceutical and biotechnology colleagues to help them get their trials up and running as quickly as possible. Yeah, hi Dan, thanks for the message. And you know we announced the launch of our Pixel by LabCorp at-home tests for COVID-19 about a week ago, and we're focused right now on frontline healthcare workers and first responders that have symptoms. And you know we've seen the demand is pretty significant in terms of not only people that are going to our website, but other people that are trying to reach out and see when it'll be available more broadly to additional people outside of those subgroups. So I do believe that this may be a reason that Pixel continues to grow over time as we go into the future.  At the same time we do plan to launch Pixel to additional groups of people as we get through the next weeks and I would expect right now we have over 100,000 kits available that will continue to make that much you know as we look out into the future on a weekly to every other week basis. And the only thing I would add is strategically there is no doubt in my mind and we're seeing more and more evidence every day, particularly as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic, having the drug development business together with the diagnostic business was a great strategic move.  And I believe in the importance of the combined today as much if not more based upon what we're going through and what we're seeing than I did even before the virus. Okay. So first of all thank you everybody for joining us today, and I have to say, I'm so proud of the way our company is mobilized to serve patients, customers, our local communities and the world. LabCorp has been innovators in science and medicine to help address global needs and I am deeply grateful to the way in which our 65,000 employees have stepped up in every country around the world.  What we do matters, and I believe it matters more in the future than it did in the past, and I believe it mattered a lot in the past. The challenge is far from over, but as I said previously, I have no doubt that we can beat this virus and also that LabCorp will remain committed to our mission to improve health and improve lives as we move forward. So, thank you so much for joining the call today."

            "name": "A - Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Yes sure. Good morning Lisa and I'll probably think \u2013 you know I've been involved with LabCorp now for six years and I began as CEO in November, and you know when an organization is pushed to the limits, you really learn a lot about the organization. And the people of LabCorp work so hard and are doing so much and care about their work in a remarkable way, and just you can get to see the heart and the soul of an organization and what I've seen is just amazing and I'm just very impressed with the people that I'm working with, the scientists, the front line workers, the phlebotomists, the carriers. The people that are building up capacity have just been outstanding, so I'm just \u2013 it's a pleasure for me to be able to work with such great people. With regard to testing, let me try to give you some background of where we are and where I see things going. So it was just about 45 days ago that we began testing. We're able to do several thousand tests a day. Right now we can do about 60,000 tests a day. I'm talking PCR testing first. I'll get to Serology in a moment, and we're going to continue to build that capacity.  I don't know the exact number that we'll be able to build to and how fast, but I would like to get over 100,000 tests per day as quickly as possible. The issue that you run into is you need additional machines and you can imagine there's lots of back orders and you know doing these RNA tests and the PCR test takes a lot of equipment. But we're going to try to build to get to over 100,000 as quickly as we can.  The interesting thing is for a short period of time when we're doing thousands a today, we did have some back orders for several weeks. We no longer have any back orders and in fact we have some additional capacity, so we're not using all of our capacity at the 60,000 per day right now. I think that's just short term and I think as states become up and running and back to business, I think that we will be at full capacity in the very near future, which is why we're trying to build more and more capacity as quickly as we can. So I believe that the PCR testing will be running at capacity for quite some time.  With regard to serology, it's still very early and it's not easy to predict. I think there's still some debate frankly in the marketplace on how to utilize the serology test and the way in which to go about using serology. Right now we can go over 50,000 serology tests a day, but we'll be able to do well over 200,000 a day by the middle of next month.  I don't know how long it will take though in order for us to use all that capacity per day and I think that there's several reasons why. One is, as companies, particularly large companies are coming back to work, some of them were talking about serology tests and doing them in a large scale, while some of them are saying they don't see the need. In addition to that, I believe there will be other ways such as point-of-care serology tests and I don't know how they are going to be used in the marketplace.  My expectation is that we'll be able to use most of our serology capacity as we get into the summer months and into the fall and I just don't know how quickly that will ramp up, but I think we'll be able to find ways to probably utilize most of the serology testing as we move forward through the summer. With regard to that though, when you think about those numbers, over 200,000 tests today in serology and maybe 100,000 tests over time for PCR, it's still a very small number compared to the 530 million or so tests that we do a year ago across all of our testing. So unless we start to see that come back, it will be hard for these tests to make up for the difference in what we've seen at the last weeks of March. Now the good news is we are starting to see a little bit less of a decline as we go towards the end of this month, and as the country gets back up and running, I would expect we'll start to see less of a decline over the summer. And assuming that there's no additional impact in the fall of this year with another impact from the COVID-19 virus, I would expect that as we get towards the end of the year a lot of the volume will come back and they always come back to the fact that what we did before was important for health.  I am worried right now that a lot of people that need diagnostic testing are not getting what they need. Once they feel comfortable again to go outside of their home, I believe they will start to go back for the diagnostic testing like they had in the past. Hopefully I've answered your questions Lisa. Thank you. Yes, so let me start with the molecular testing. So molecular test, the reimbursed rate by Medicare is about \u2013 is $100, and that's what we charge all customers, $100. We're trying to in this pandemic and time of need, we're looking for a consistency and we're charging a consistent pricing across the market place.  We don't have a Medicare price yet for the serology testing. I'm not saying for certainty that that will be our price that we charge all customers, but if you look at what we've done with the PCR testing, that's something that I'll be looking at very, very closely. Again, I want to make sure that we're seeing and doing everything we can in this pandemic to help in every way which we can, and I think that we should know something hopefully in the next days, certainly not more than a week or so I would expect."

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments by discussing the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, and then provide some details on our first quarter results. While we're not providing specific guidance today for the year, I'll provide some commentary on our current assumptions and expectations for the remainder of 2020.  As Adam noted, our combined diagnostics and drug development offering uniquely enables us to help combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, by supporting the detection of the virus through diagnostic testing, as well as the development of treatments. While we continue to play a critical role in combating this pandemic, COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the performance of both of our businesses, albeit at different magnitude and in different ways. In our diagnostics business, at the end of the quarter, we experienced reductions in demand for testing a 50% to 55% versus the company's normal daily levels. This reduction in demand impacted testing volume broadly, but with a more heavily weighted towards routine procedures. It also impacted esoteric tests, but to a lesser degree due to the critical and time sensitive nature of these test results.  In addition, while we've ramped up capacity for COVID-19 tests, the impact of the new volume has only marginally offset the lower volume we're experiencing with our broader test offering. While not impacting the quarter, we are also focused on increasing capacity of our new COVID-19 serology antibody tests of over 200,000 per day by mid-May, along with the increasing capacity of COVID-19 at-home test kit offering. Yeah. Dan I guess I'll just add too. When you look at our normalized level of organic volume, it was pretty consistent with where we've been, at roughly around 1.3% when you take out the unusuals if you will.  So as Adam said, obviously backing out the impact of COVID, which we said was around a 7.3% impact, then we had three other kind of discrete items, two that were positive. So we benefited from the half of revenue day and that was around 0.7% benefits to our volume growth and then we had favorable weather compared to a year ago of around 0.8%. But that was offset effectively by lower consumer genetics demand at 1.6%.  So effectively a 1.3% for us has been kind of where we track it. Obviously it improved over the fourth quarter, but kind of where we would expect to track and I know you mentioned our competitor. We do talk about them and we do treat the treatment of volume differently for our lab management fees, which would have added around 60 basis points. So we feel really good that the base business from a demand standpoint, a volume standpoint, it's been pretty consistent.  What we've also been very pleased about, that really impacts our revenues even more is on the price side you know and while overall our pricing here we would say is relatively flat, the mix impact really was nice. So again in a similar vein, while we simply show kind of organic pricing at around a 3.4% increase, we had a couple of headwinds and tailwinds.  You know we benefited from \u2013 as Adam said from COVID where we have the lower percentage impacted from the esoteric tests, so it mixes this up. That helped us around 1.9%. Similarly with the lower consumer demand, consumer generics demand at a lower price point, that's helped our mix at 0.9% and then the headwind as we talked about already have PAMA and Beacon each at around 1.1%.  So again getting to a normalized price would get us to around a price mix of 2.8%, which actually is tracked higher than what we've done over the past year, you know in line, call it with the last couple of quarters where we've been north of two, but we continue to see favorable price mix. So from a revenue standpoint, again excluding COVID, we thought we had actually a very strong quarter. So thank you for the question Ricky. Right now the Medicare price is $100 and that's been our price and our philosophy on pricing, which is to use the Medicare price, which they take a lot of time, spend a lot of effort to think through what is appropriate. And therefore we have charged all customers at that price. I have no reason to believe that that price would change, based upon anything I know today.  And I think that the testing for PCR will continue to grow, but the importance of it, it makes it very cost effective to test patients and actually find out who has the disease and then isolate them, so others don't get the disease. So I think it's a very cost effective way in order to insure that you do everything you can. At the same time I would say that the capital expense and the difficulty of PCR is pretty high, and doing the PCR testing is not simple. I mean it's an RNA extraction that has multiple steps. So I feel like the reimbursement where it is today is at a good rate. Yeah, this is Glenn. I'd say you know as we look at our reserves for receivables, you know we looked obviously back at prior recessions and big events that occurred in the USSA with the high unemployment rates, the impact that it's having on our customers if you will. Our expectation is that business that we've already conducted, that we currently have as receivables outstanding, we've assessed that full amount and have taken kind of a one-time charge or one-time reserve relative to those receivables. We'll obviously still look to go and collect on them, but it's based upon historical experiences we feel that's an appropriate level to build the reserve for that.  So as we go forward, we have a normal standard process every quarter. We assess the adequacy of all of our reserves. So at this point we would say we're fully reserved based on what we believe and then if anything changes in the future, we'll adjusted that, but our expectation is that the reserves that we established are adequate to deal with the environment that we're operating in. Sure Michael. It is kind of an interesting exercise given that these are point in time. So as you recall in our 10-K, we commented that we did have one of the reporting units within drug development that was relatively close, fair value versus the book value, and that was performed as we do all of our reporting units, you know based upon September 30 and we report that on it for the year. But when we bring it to our kind of outside firm that does our valuations, it's based upon a point in time.  And so what's interesting that's happened is now we move forward to March 31 where we've now done it again, and obviously the business has been impacted by COVID and a lot of others, but we look at the valuations or they look at valuations, based upon DCFs as well as just market valuations. And so interestingly when you look at the CRO market multiples, from September 30 through March 30, they are down 30%, and so we are effectively half of the valuations saying the value of the business is down 30% at that one point in time.  Frankly if we were to do it today, you know it would be a very different number, but accounting says you do it on that date and then also given the volatility in the market, you have the discount rate that was increased. So from their exercise on the value of the business on a particular day, you know that caused the decline at which we took the non-cash charge during the quarter. Sure, effectively we have a lot of different reporting units, but the one reporting unit here that's broken out primarily relates to our clinical business. So that's the reporting unit, separate. And as you know when you look at even an acquisition and you break up the pieces to it, it doesn't necessarily say it's reflective of the total valuation of a company.  It's just the specific reporting unit that's broken out, as well as the specific goodwill that allocated to that business at that point in time, and so to your point you could say that within a year ago you acquired a business and you paid the market multiple for that business at that time.  Now all of a sudden you see a 30% correction, that business that you just bought is now theoretically worth 30% less. And accounting would say that's what you value it at that day, and then six months later you could be back-up to that same market multiple, the valuation goes back up, but you don't write it back up, it's just the convention. So you know just a confluence of events with COVID-19 impacting earnings, results of all the companies, as well as the market valuations resulted in the impairment charge. Yeah, I'd say obviously how we'll account for it you know we'll determine as we go through the quarterly and report. I think it's fair to say, given we've even done it now anything that is unusual, we will either call out separately or at least explaining the performance benefited from that. But clearly, to some extent a recoup if you will of the negative impact that we're being impacted by COVID, as well as the capital spend and other spend that we're making in order to ramp-up our testing as well. And while there are other tranches of the CARES Act that we could potentially be included in, at this stage it's just too early to tell what that would be and obviously once we have more clarity on that, we'll be able to convey that."

We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today. Labcorp is carrying on our mission to improve health and improve lives by harnessing the power of science, technology and innovation. In doing so, we're able to execute against our strategy, to deliver strong results for stakeholders and to effectively respond to global challenges like the pandemic. Our company rounded out an historic 2021 with another strong quarter that sets the stage for further success in 2022 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.77, and free cash flow was $548 million. For the full year, revenue was $16.1 billion, adjusted EPS totaled $28.52, and free cash flow reached $2.6 billion. Our Base Business continued its progress during the quarter, with Diagnostics and Drug Development revenue growing 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively. In Diagnostics, Base Business organic volume increased as esoteric and routine procedures continued their year-over-year growth. Drug Development ended the year with a solid trailing 12-month net book-to-bill of 1.25 and a strong backlog of $15 billion, representing a $579 million increase in the third quarter. Also decentralized clinical trial awards were up 62% over the prior year. Moving to the pandemic. Our ongoing response remains an example of how innovation can drive success. For nearly two years, Labcorp has dedicated significant resources to stemming the spread of the virus. We are proud of the progress we've made thus far, though the rise of variants like Omicron and surges and infection rates make it clear that our work is not over. We continue to leverage Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access, to identify and monitor new variants and to advance vaccine and therapy development. In the fourth quarter, COVID testing volumes were greater than anticipated. We have performed over 74 million tests for COVID to-date, of which approximately 8.6 million were the fourth quarter. This heightened demand continued into the New Year, although volume is significantly less now than in December or in January. Time to results for COVID PCR test remained one to two days on average even during the latest surge. As we've done throughout the pandemic, we are keeping capacity levels high to quickly respond to spikes and testing needs. We are continuing to invest in equipment, elevated staffing levels and our supply chain. In addition, we remain prepared and staffed to support additional drug development work for vaccines, including boosters, or additional therapies. The company's COVID-related innovations in the quarter included the rollout of observed self-collection for COVID PCR testing at over 1,000 patient service centers. And at the start of the fourth quarter, we announced the receipt of FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu at-home collection kit. These offerings are reflective of our work to make COVID testing faster, easier and more accessible. I'll now turn to our enterprise strategy, where we made significant progress in 2021. I'll provide a few highlights that will give you a sense of our growth and our forward momentum. In oncology, we made significant strides in fortifying our position as a leader by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities. At the same time, we followed through on our commitment to improve cancer care access. Last year, we formed our Oncology business unit, and we introduced our Enterprise Oncology offering. Genomic profiling of tumors is key to identifying the best targeted therapy for oncology patients. In December, we announced our agreement to acquire Personal Genome Diagnostics, or PGDx. The company has a strong portfolio of innovative liquid biopsy and tissue-based products, which complement our existing capabilities. Through PGDx-kitted solutions, we can provide oncologists access to tumor profiling at the hospitals where the patients are treated or centralized to one of our laboratories. These solutions may also enable us to expand tumor profiling globally to help our pharmaceutical sponsors find the right novel treatment for patients. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of this year. Other exciting expansions of our oncology test menu included clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer; and OmniSeq INSIGHT, a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for people with late-stage solid tumors. All of these offerings can help physicians make more informed decisions about treatments for their patients and help bring new medicines to market for cancer. In 2021, we intensified our customer focus and embedded technology and data throughout our business. This included improvements to the patient experience in our service centers. These upgrades focused on creating a seamless journey from appointment scheduling to service center visits to easier access to results. Our acquisition of Ovia Health enhanced our position as an important source of information for women's health, which we support through diagnostics, genetic and specialty testing expertise as well as clinical trials. We will continue to identify opportunities to enhance Ovia Health's innovative platform that provides family planning, pregnancy and parenting support. Additionally, we began to deploy Labcorp Diagnostics Assistant. This new tool delivers a detailed view of a patient's lab history along with clinical insights directly to the point of care to inform diagnostic decisions. We opened an automated kit production line in Belgium in the spring. And in the fourth quarter, we opened an integrated laboratory in Singapore, which strengthens our bioanalytical services in the Asia Pacific region. And just this month, we announced the launch of Labcorp OnDemand, which builds on the success of Pixel by LabCorp. This suite of health tests and services offers easy and convenient access to a wide variety of trusted tests. It's another way that Labcorp is meeting people where they are and offering more options for people to stay healthy. We pursued numerous opportunities throughout the year that have long-term and high-growth potential. We did tuck-in deals and strategic acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Ovia Health, PGDx and Myriad Autoimmune\u2019s Vectra Test, which analyzes biomarkers to measure rheumatoid arthritis. Yesterday, we announced a comprehensive strategic agreement with Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States. Through our new long-term relationship with Ascension, we will manage its hospital-based laboratories in 10 states, and we will purchase select assets of its outreach laboratory business for approximately $400 million. We expect the first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million from the combined hospital business and lab asset acquisition. While operating margins are expected to be less than segment margins initially, they are expected to improve each year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to our earnings and cash flow in year one and should return its cost of capital by year two. This is a notable opportunity for us and one of the most significant deals of its kind in the sector. It expands our clinical services in several states across the country, and it builds on our strong track record of building similar relationships. The deal with Ascension also underscores our ability to help health systems manage industry-wide shifts. As part of the collaboration, we will explore clinical trial and oncology opportunities that enhance patient access. We look forward to this new partnership and ultimately to welcoming new colleagues to Labcorp. We also reached agreements with other hospitals and hospital systems, including Minnesota-based North Memorial Health. We continue to be excited about our robust M&A pipeline and expect more activity in the coming months. In 2021, we provided the highest-quality service to customers and patients, and we made meaningful investments in our people. In fact, Labcorp has consistently been recognized for the impact of our work and for the value we place on our employees. We were recently named again the Fortune Magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies. And for the fifth consecutive year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation designated Labcorp as the best place to work for LGBTQ+ Equality. We were also named one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2022 by Newsweek. Importantly, in 2021, management and the Board of Directors worked with outside advisors, thoroughly reviewed our structure and capital allocation. As part of the comprehensive review of our structure, we had extensive discussions with third parties, and the Board considered a wide range of options, including significant acquisitions, divestitures, spinning off businesses as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners. The Board unanimously concluded that the company's existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time. That said, we continue to believe that Labcorp shares are not fully valued in the marketplace. To that end, we announced several actions designed to further enhance shareholder value. Among them are the initiation of a dividend starting in the second quarter of 2022 as well as a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, $1 billion of which is being repurchased on an accelerated basis. We are also implementing a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative that targets $350 million in savings over the next three years. And today, in addition to giving 2022 guidance, we will also share a longer-term outlook. And beginning with first quarter results, we will provide additional business insights through enhanced disclosures. Moving forward, we are committed to profitable growth through investments in science, innovation and new technology. As we execute on our strategy, management and Board will continue to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value. In conclusion, our strong Base Business performance, coupled with formidable progress against our strategic priorities in 2021, sets us up for long-term success. This gives us great confidence in our longer-term growth-oriented bright outlook, which Glenn will take you through, along with our 2022 guidance. I am proud of what the team at Labcorp accomplished together in 2021, and I am excited for all that to come this year and into the future as we continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment, our 2022 full year guidance and then conclude with our longer-term outlook through 2024. Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year, due to declines in organic revenue of 10.3% and divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.6% and favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points. The 10.3% decline in organic revenue was driven by a 15.3% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5% increase in the company's organic base business. Operating income for the quarter was $731 million, or 18% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $93 million of amortization and $79 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $902 million or 22.2% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion or 31.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. Excluding COVID testing, the Base Business compared to the Base Business last year experienced higher adjusted operating income and margins due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.6% compared to 24.8% last year. Going forward, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform. Net earnings for the quarter were $553 million or $5.75 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.77 in the quarter, down from $10.56 last year. Operating cash flow was $698 million in the quarter compared to $775 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $150 million compared to $99 million last year. And as a result, free cash flow was $548 million in the quarter compared to $675 million last year. During the quarter, we used $1 billion of our cash flow for our accelerated share repurchase program and invested $171 million on acquisitions. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 16.9% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 17.8%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.7% and favorable foreign currency translation of 20 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 21.8% reduction from COVID testing, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the Base Business revenue was 5%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 8.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 8.9%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 14.6% decline in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in the Base Business. Price/mix decreased 8.2% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 7.2% and lower Base Business of 1.6%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5% and currency of 0.2%. Diagnostics organic base business revenue growth was 7.2% compared to its Base Business last year, with 8.1% coming from volume, partially offset by a 1% decline from price/mix. The price/mix decline was primarily due to the recovery of our Canadian business, which carries a lower average requisition price. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $776 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 39.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year, primarily due to a volume decline of approximately 50% while the company continued to maintain capacity. Base Business margins were higher compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Diagnostics achieved its goal to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings from its three-year LaunchPad initiative. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to last year due to organic base business growth of 7.9% and acquisitions of 0.3%, partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its centralized business of 4% and divestitures of 0.3%. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 9.9%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $206 million, or 14.2% of revenue compared to $248 million, or 17.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to lower COVID testing. In the Base Business, higher personnel and other inflationary costs as well as investments in oncology capabilities were partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. We continue to exclude the enterprise component of Drug Development bonus expense, which is reflected in corporate unallocated and totaled $11 million for the quarter. While margins were down in the quarter, they were up for the full year compared to 2020, and we expect margins to continue to increase in 2022. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.3 billion and 1.25, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. And we expect approximately $5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2022 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2021, for the full year. In addition, the guidance includes the softness we experienced in January due to Omicron, which we expect will rebound through the rest of the quarter. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends, which we will initiate in the second quarter. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 1.5% to 6.5% compared to 2021. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 7.5% to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 75%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 11.5% to 17.5% compared to 2021. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 3.5% to 6%. COVID testing revenue is expected to decline 60% to 75%. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.4%, primarily driven by organic growth in both volume and price mix. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 7% to 9.5% compared to 2021. This guidance includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 7.5% to 10% compared to 2021. Given the amount of capacity we have within Diagnostics, we've assumed that no COVID testing will be performed in Drug Development central lab business in 2022. We expect to benefit from broad-based growth in all three businesses, helping drive continued margin improvement in the segment. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11.3%. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $17.25 to $21.25 compared to 2021 adjusted EPS of $28.52. The adjusted EPS guidance reflects the expectation of lower COVID testing in 2022, while the Base Business continues to profitably grow. Free cash flow is expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2021. Now I'll discuss our longer-term outlook, which reflects our current view of the business from 2022 to 2024. We expect enterprise Base Business organic revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 7% compared to 2021. We also expect revenue growth from acquisitions to represent additional annual growth of 2% to 3%. We expect Diagnostics Base Business organic revenue to grow at a 2.5% to 4.5% CAGR compared to 2021. This outlook is higher than historical growth driven by a continued recovery in our Base Business relative to 2021, broad-based growth, including hospitals and health systems, and the lower incremental impact of PAMA in the outlook period. We expect Drug Development Base Business organic revenue to grow at a 7% to 10% CAGR compared to 2021. This outlook is higher than our historical growth, and we have added capacity and inorganic investments in the last few years in our faster-growing early development and late-stage clinical businesses. As we continue to emphasize profitable growth, we expect enterprise margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points on average annually through the outlook period compared to 2021, which was approximately 14.5%. This margin expansion is due in part to the company's LaunchPad initiative, which is expected to deliver $350 million of cost savings over the time period to help offset inflationary costs. And finally, we expect adjusted EPS to grow at an 11% to 14% CAGR compared to 2020 - 2019 adjusted EPS of $11.32. We continue to use 2019 as the base year comparison for earnings growth to better reflect the earnings power of the company, excluding COVID testing. The adjusted EPS outlook reflects the expectation that both base businesses will continue to profitably grow organically. In addition, we expect to benefit from capital allocation directed towards accretive acquisitions and share repurchases while keeping within our targeted gross debt leverage of 2.5 to 3 times. For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 fourth quarter and full year results, 2022 guidance and our longer-term outlook. In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our Base Business. For 2022, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the year. In addition, our longer-term outlook is expected to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth driven by top line growth, margin improvement and capital allocation. Operator, we'll now take questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Wanted to start and ask about the long-term outlook. So in the 11% to 14% adjusted EPS CAGR versus 2019, can you talk about what your assumption is related to diagnostics pricing and maybe the return of PAMA in 2023? And also just what you're assuming in terms of any ongoing COVID benefit beyond 2022?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Good morning, Jack. Yes, a couple of things. So first of all, if you look at diagnostics pricing, I'll start with PAMA. There is obviously no impact of PAMA this year. Working through ACLA, which is the trade organization, we're going to continue to fight for a more rational way to think about PAMA in the future. But for our base case, we're assuming that in 2023, there'd be about $100 million impact. And in 2024, it'd be about half of that. So that's kind of what we're thinking for PAMA. In terms of other pricing, we don't see any acceleration of pricing decline. We're going to try to see if there's any way to increase pricing in certain areas. That's not easy. I don't think I would build a lot into the plan for that. But we're also looking at other things like Labcorp OnDemand, where you might have a different type of pricing as you go directly to consumers and so forth. So in general, I would think about the overall pricing pressure continuing, the PAMA pressure being less as we go into the 2024 time frame, and that the underlying base business is where we'll continue to see strong performance. And hopefully, what you can see is that we have a strong commitment to the Base Business in Diagnostics. If you think about COVID, we don't have much built in, if any, frankly, as you start to get into 2024 and beyond, we'll see how that turns out. But it really is all about the Base Business, it's about our ability to continue to grow in our geographies where we're strong. You heard about our deal today with Ascension. It's about doing more of those types of deals. So we think that the future is very bright for Diagnostics and our ability to grow, but it's not through pricing, and there will continue to be pricing pressure. It's more through geographic expansion, hospital deals and continued growth in the segment itself.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, Jack, the only thing I'd add to the discussion was just that when you look at the guidance that we provided or the outlook for the longer-term, what you see is obviously good top line growth across the businesses, supplemented by obviously acquisitions from capital allocation, but that we do expect to see margin improvement over this period of time and net margin improvement coming from both businesses. So to your point, helping offset some of the inflationary costs as well as PAMA, at least that's in, call it, 2023 and potentially beyond that. And that it's really also then utilizing our balance sheet and our free cash flow. So we expect to be back within our targeted leverage of that 2.5 times to three times over that period of time. So using that cash flow to support acquisitions that, again, will be targeted at least 2% to 3% and then dividends, and then obviously, with the remainder going back to returning capital through our share repurchase program.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to talk about the Ascension deal. Was hoping for just some more color on what brought that together, how long you had been working toward this. And I ask because there's been a lot of focus on some of the challenges in the lab industry as it pertains to labor. I was curious how much that might have weighed into this. And then finally, can you just stack up Ascension versus some of the other things you might be looking at your pipeline at the moment?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, so, we've had a very good discussion in partnership with the team at Ascension. It's been really a pleasure to work with them. We've been talking to them for quite some time, frankly. And these are the types of deals that they're long term, strategic in nature. So it takes time. You have to make sure that the cultures are a fit, that the organizations have the same types of culture, and you get to know each other. And that's what these deals tend to take a while before they come to fruition. So we've been talking to our partners there for quite some time now. And what I would say is once we realize the cultural fit, that we could work together well, that there's a focus on patient care and ensuring that the patients get the needs that they - or the services that they need, to ensure that the physicians and the hospitals are able to get the test that they want, to ensure that as new colleagues move over into Labcorp over time that they would have a good experience, that's when we began to get even more and more serious about the partnership and discussions. This is a very large deal. Typically, they're not near as large as this. But again, it's one of many hospital systems that we're talking to, and we continue to feel good about the pipeline.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe I'll just ask about the COVID assumptions for 2022. Obviously, the range you're giving, I think, equates to about $690 million at the low-end, $1.1 billion at the high-end. Does the high-end assume additional surges, some testing in the fourth quarter around cough, cold and flu? Is the low-end pretty much what you've already almost seen in the first quarter? Just give us some flavor on that. And have you assumed - so how it progresses over the course of the year? And any change in relevant pricing assumptions versus where you're at now with the PAG and all?\nAdam Schechter: Sure. Good morning, A.J. So I'll give you some context, and I'll give you a sense of how we think about it. So we did 74 million tests for COVID for date - to date, and about 8.5 million, 8.6 million of those in the fourth quarter. So that gives you about 83,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. If you look at the end of the fourth quarter last year, you actually saw significantly higher than the average of 83,000. And in the beginning of January, we actually saw more than at the end of December. So we saw a real peak in the first couple of weeks throughout most of January. If we look at where we are right now, we're actually closer to where we were in the average back in December and back in the fourth quarter. So you've already seen a significant decline in COVID testing. The reason we gave you a range of minus 60% to minus 75% is because there's a multitude of ways to be within that range. One could be that there's another variant, and therefore, you have increase in volume. We don't know when that would happen. Last year, I never would have expected anything to happen in the summer. And we saw something in the summer, and we also saw another surge in the wintertime. As we go through this year, we don't know if there'll be another variant and/or another surge. But the other thing that could be is that the price stays where it is and there's not a surge, and you could get to our range through that. If there is a price decrease, if the emergency is not declared again after April, you could see another surge that would offset a price increase if the emergency situation is released. So as I think about it, I think we're going to continue to see a decline in testing. I personally believe that the emergency situation will be hit through this year, which would keep price relatively consistent. There'll always be pressure on the price. But the range of 60% to 75% would be within multiple different things happening. So it's hard to give you an exact number, A.J., because as we did last year, we gave you our best estimate and each quarter, we changed it based on new information, new data we have. We'll continue to break it out separately so we can inform you of what we're seeing and what we think. But that's the best information we have at this time.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. A.J., the only thing\u2026\nA.J. Rice: Okay.\nGlenn Eisenberg: I would add just additionally for your modeling purposes, as you would expect, that we expect the strongest period to be in the first quarter and then obviously going on as the year unfolds. But wide range of outcomes, but the trend clearly to be lower, call it, in the second half than what we would expect in the first half at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: So when we think about the long-term guidance of 11% to 14% of 2019, what is - how should we think about sort of the right 2022 EPS base line that we should apply? Because based on kind of like your results, right, 2021 grew faster than 11% to 14%. So how should we think about that right baseline EPS base to calculate off? And also, in the long-term guide, what are your underlying assumptions for labor and supply cost inflation?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Ricky. And we spent a lot of time obviously trying to give you the best information we could because the baselines are a bit tricky as you think about everything that's happened with COVID. So I'll have Glenn give you some additional specifics there. Labor and supply, there's no doubt that we're getting hit with significant inflation. Labor and supply is not something we take lightly. We're watching it very closely, and we're seeing wage increases and supply increases. That's where we put in place the $350 million LaunchPad initiative to help offset that. The issue that occurs, Ricky, is that you get hit with the labor and supply and the wage issues right away, and then it takes you time to get the cost out. So we've given you our guidance over time, and we've given our averages over time. But for example, I think that the first quarter of this year will be harder than by the time we get to the fourth quarter this year because you get hit with all the wage inflation, and we had some weather and with the Omicron variant and so forth. And it takes us some time to get the cost out, which we're working very hard on. That's why we feel confident to give you the 30 million to 50 million basis point improvement on average per year because we feel confident we can do that. But the timing is going to be a little bit different because you get hit hard with the wage and the supply inflation, and then it takes you time to get the cost out. But we assume there will be continued pressure on wages and supply as we go through the long-term outlook. We don't think it's something that's temporary, and that's where we have to continue to find ways reduce costs where we can. And maybe, Glenn, you can give some Phase 5 discussion.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Hi, Ricky. The reason why, obviously, we chose to do a growth rate off of 2019 was to get to a pre-pandemic level and that we expect that by the end of the, call it, the long-term horizon, COVID will be de minimis into that number. So that was kind of the double-digit growth rate that we would expect at the 11% to 14% CAGR. We did comment because - on revenue, we can go off of a 21% base, because we distinguish between COVID revenue and Base Business revenue. But when we were talking about margins, just to show that we do expect to see margin improvement over the time, we did comment that you would get to roughly around a 14.5% margin in 2021 from the Base Business. And again, the reason why we say that's an estimate is because there's a lot of shared resources that are supporting both the COVID business and the Base Business, but it's a proxy. And if you just took that further down and set as a proxy, that 14.5% on your Base Business margin would get you to roughly, call it, around a $14 a share number from an adjusted EPS from the Base Business. So either you use the base estimate in, call it, 2021 of earnings and growing double-digits or the base of 2019, which is a clean number for our Base Business, you still get to roughly the same trend in that 22% from a base business and beyond. We do expect double-digit growth in each of the periods going forward within that outlook horizon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one on the Drug Development side. Obviously, with the 7% to 10% guide, you're expecting pretty healthy fundamentals there. Can you just talk about the funding backdrop? And we get a lot of questions out just the biotech environment in general. Obviously, it's been pretty volatile, not too many in terms of the equity capital markets, not too much action. So how are you guys thinking about that? Is what you're seeing in terms of the balance sheets on the biotech and pharma side sufficient to kind of support healthy growth? Obviously, you feel that way. And then secondarily, similar on the Drug Development side, would love just your perspective on China given some of the news this week in terms of the unverified list, any of that activity change, how you think about that region or how you think about the business overall? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Hi, Patrick. Good morning. So our RFPs continue to be very strong, and we continue to get a significant number of RFPs. Discussions with pharma and biotech clients is that they have strong pipelines, and there's a lot that they still need to do to be funded. If you look at our net orders, I mean, we had $7.3 billion in net orders. And our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still above 1.2, which is what we look to be, and it was very strong for the quarter itself. You look at our backlog, it's $15 billion, so it's almost 9% increase versus last year. And about $5 billion of that backlog we expect to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. So every indication we have is that the RFPs, the funding remains strong for us to be within the range of growth that we expect to be in the long-term outlook that we gave to you. In terms of China, China remains a very important market for pharma. I believe that they will continue to be an important growth market. So therefore, we have a significant presence there. We're able to perform studies there. We built significant organic in terms of people and capabilities in the country, and I think it was the right thing to do, and it will show that it will continue to be the right thing to do over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much. A lot of questions on Ascension. I think first, just if you could share with us the total lab revenue of Ascension or the percentage that you're initially taking over here. Any outlook for expansion potential down the road? Number two, could you give us how many hospitals you're actually taking over? Ascension has 142. I think you're getting 10 of 20 states that they're operating in. And then finally, I was curious if you could give us the mix of the hospital lab management versus the outreach revenue that you're assuming in the $550 million to $600 million estimate? Thanks very much.\nAdam Schechter: And I'll give you some context, and I'll ask Glenn to jump in with some numbers as well. So first of all, we're excited about this opportunity, and we think that it is a great opportunity for not just the patients that Ascension serves and a long-term relationship that we'll have with them. But we expect the first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million from their hospital business and the lab asset acquisition. What I would say is we work with them on what they wanted to do at the time in terms of the size and the scale of the partnership. And we believe there will be opportunities for us to work together in many different ways as we go into the future, not just with hospital work, by the way. And we're going to explore clinical trial work together, oncology opportunities that enhance patient access. So there's lots of opportunities for us as we go into the future. I don't want to speak too much about them and their percent of revenue. So for, I think that's something you would need to ask Ascension. But what we can tell you is that we believe that this long-term partnership is going to be very, very fruitful for both organizations. Glenn, do you want to give a little further context?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, I agree. And Eric, what we did put in the release was that the assets that we're acquiring, the Outreach Labs, would have had year revenue of approximately $150 million and that by putting in the full year annualized revenues, as Adam said, the $550 million to $600 million, that, that $150 million, we're taking on some compression with it but then growth from it as well. Would size up what we got within the outreach business versus the strategic partnership of managing the in-hospital labs being the difference.\nEric Coldwell: Glenn, thank you for that. I should have expanded on my question. I'm trying to squeeze it in under the time limits here. But the - typically, we see repricing volumes on outreach deals - or the repricing is, I think, typically something like 30%. I don't know if that's similar to what you're seeing here. And then I did actually have another question on hospital lab management deals. I know the rev rec can be, at least at your peers, it's probably in the ballpark of half of what they would see on a normal requisition revenue. So I was just curious if you could give us some sense on the pricing dynamics with this deal.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Eric, what I would say is, again, with the revenues that we're picking up, to your point, there is compression. Again, that comes with the outreach labs that we have, and that's reflected and we said approximately $150 million. But it will be compressed and then we'll grow. So it does give you at least an indication of the mix, if you will. From a pricing, again, similarly, we expect to have normal, call it, pricing kind of margins that would come with the outreach. But with the in-hospital labs, to your point, they are at a lower price point. So when you look at the mix impact, and Adam commented in his remarks, that strategic partnership of this size with that much going from the in-hospital lab management, you would expect to see lower than, obviously, segment margins. But the positive is that once we start there the first year and we see that margin compression, we expect to then see that grow and improve through efficiencies and productivity and so forth. So dilutive to margins for sure. Obviously, it's a transaction that we think from a return standpoint is very attractive. Excited about the strategic partnership, excited about the potential additional growth that could occur with that partnership over time. That will continue to drive good returns for the company and margins that will improve over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Good morning guys and congrats on the quarter. I guess my question, Glenn, as I think about the long-term guidance again, right, I mean, 2.5% to 4.5% of the base lab, kind of like revenue or growth assumption. How are you thinking about kind of like what the drivers are of that being above? And then maybe like the timing, is that more front-end loaded given some easier comps? And then how do I think about the capabilities that you've added over the last few years as being contributing to that above-average growth? Thanks.\nGlenn Eisenberg: So first, to your point, the growth rate is a little bit higher than our historical organic growth within the business. But a lot of that is with the investments that we've made and the growth and the focus of the strategic growth, such as the hospital systems and so forth, where we continue to find opportunities to see additional growth. Those CAGRs, if you will, are based upon 2021, which again would not have been, call it, a fully recovered year. So we get some of the benefits of that growth. The recent acquisitions that we've done that have been already, call it, in the base, so not new acquisitions but ones that have done, not necessarily have been fully annualized. We continue to get some additional growth from that. The fact that our expectation for PAMA that in the outlook period's less impactful than what it had been historically for us continues that. And just the overall efficiencies, LaunchPad that supports the topline growth as well. So we think we're on a good cadence and good momentum to be able to hit those numbers over the planning horizon.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to highlight a little bit that you still say when it comes to the strategic alternatives sort of at this time, and I'm wondering if anything has changed. Obviously, you enter a whole process here, then you did a nice acquisition. You have this big Ascension deal. What would need to change for you to go back and rethink the potential for something more strategic with regards to the strategic alternatives? Is it a willing partner? Is it the market conditions? Can you just sort of take us through what would need to change or what might prompt a revisit of the very strategic alternatives?\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. When we went through the strategic review, we looked at everything, and we were very thorough. I mean we spent almost a year evaluating all the alternatives, talking to people externally, making sure that we looked at not just structure but capital allocation. And after that entire process, the Board unanimously agreed that at this time, the structure is right. But we also realized and believed that our shares are not still fully valued in the marketplace. And we're doing a lot of things in terms of capital allocation and additional disclosures and long-term guidance, which we think will help with shareholder return. We believe that this should help more fully value the shares in the marketplace. But we also agree as a management and Board that we should always be looking at alternative scenarios and we should always be open if there's other things over time that makes sense. So it's another way of us acknowledging that it's not a one-and-done type of analysis. It's an analysis that you continually do, you continually refresh, you continually look at where you are, how you're performing, how things in the marketplace are evolving. So that's all you're hearing at the moment. We're going to continue to look at our options as anybody would expect you to do.\nKevin Caliendo: Fair enough. And if I could do a really quick follow-up. Just on the cadence for the year. You did say you expect COVID to be higher. Is there any other inputs that could affect what might normally be a regular cadence for the company? Is there any costs associated with Ascension upfront? Any timing issues that we should be thinking about as we model out the year?\nAdam Schechter: The only thing I would say, Kevin, as I mentioned, in January, you had a lot of weather. You had a lot of Omicron where even some of our employees weren't able to get in to open up service centers. And with Drug Development, we had - you have to charge for people when they work, but if people aren't working because they're ill - we faced issues that you saw in almost every business in the United States. So, first quarter is going to be probably one of the tougher quarters versus the other quarters in the year. But all that's been taken into full evaluation. And as we provided our guidance for 2022 and longer-term, we've looked at all of that. So other than that, I think things look strong, and we continue to be optimistic about the guidance and where we are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Thanks for taking my question. My question here is on the long-term outlook of 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion. Did I understand that you're modeling 2023 EBIT margins in Diagnostics increasing in 2023 despite the $100 million of PAMA impact? And I think you did talk about a lot of pressures here on labor and supply costs. Can you give us some more details on how LaunchPad can offset those impacted? It seems like there's a lot of headwinds coming from inflation in PAMA, and your sales were guiding to margins increasing. I just want to understand some more details of how you guys going to achieve that. Thanks a lot.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll start off with, there's no doubt that we're seeing inflation and we're seeing wage inflation, but also material costs going up and those things. But that's why we put in place the $350 million of cost savings. And it's not going to be $100 million, $100 million, $100 million over three years. We're going to try to get as much as we can out in the first year and then do more in the following years. The timing, as I mentioned earlier, will be a little bit different. The pressure hits you right away, but you take out the costs as you go through the year. And to give you a sense, the type of things that we're looking at, for example, are in our diagnostic area. Right now, you might assess a sample, meaning log it into the system in one area. And then you might have to fly it to another lab in a different part of the country. And then there might be another test that you have to do in another lab. We're looking at ways to streamline that so you get the results faster, but you wouldn't have the sample moving around as often. It's good for your ESG goals, but it also is good for patients and ultimately could reduce cost. So we're looking at those type of initiatives, which ultimately could reduce cost, but doesn't happen in a matter of days. It takes a little bit of time to kind of reshuffle reorganize what you're trying to do. But we have a lot of initiatives like that, that we're putting things like our automated propel system that we're going to put in additional laboratories, it can reduce cost. It's less wage pressure, because it doesn't take as many people necessary to run, but also you can get better quality, faster results at time. So we're looking for things to fundamentally change some of our business processes, and that's why it takes a little bit longer. But that's also why we're confident that we can deliver on the 30 to 50 basis point improvement in margin over time if you look at it on average.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: Thank you for taking my question. So could you just come in a little bit more detail on the long-term outlook for the Drug Development business? And specifically, are you willing to sort of give us some additional color on what your assumptions are for early-stage Central Lab and late-stage, just to sort of give us a better kind of view on the mix of the business and what's going on there? You're obviously seeing a much bigger - you're seeing acceleration in that business relative to historical trends and just like a little bit more underlying drivers on the segments? Thank you very much.\nAdam Schechter: Sure, Derik. I'll give you a little bit. Glenn can jump in. The first thing I'd tell you, Derik, is that we're going to give some additional disclosures when we report our first quarter earnings in April. So I think that will be helpful. We do that at that time. But clearly, when you look at the growth, I mean, a lot of the growth is coming from the later-stage clinical trial business. We see great opportunities there. We've invested in there with things like GlobalCare as well as snapIOT to give us good capabilities in terms of decentralized clinical trials, which are becoming more and more important. We've built our presence in Japan and in China in that business. So you'll see - and we believe that's an area that we can get very significant growth and also margin improvement. And then if you look at the Central laboratory business, we're a leader there, and we continue to feel strong in that business. But because you're a leader, the ability to grow isn't necessarily as easy as the ability to grow in area like clinical trials, where we're not yet where we want to be in terms of leadership. And then the last thing I'd say is that our early-stage business is a smaller business. I mean we're still able to compete. We have the ability to compete effectively in that business, but it's not the size or the magnitude of the other two businesses. We do expect strong growth in that business but at a scale that's smaller than the first two businesses.\nGlenn Eisenberg: The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the components of the businesses, to your point, early development and the late-stage clinical businesses have historically are higher-growth businesses than the Central Lab business. And so we've made a lot of investments in capacity to continue to be able to fuel that growth in those two areas in particular. The acquisitions that we've done, whether it's Toxicon, GlobalCare, snapIOT have been targeted in the higher-growth areas within ED and Central Lab or in late stage rather. So just the mix of our business continues to be more weighted towards the faster-growing parts that we've made. So overall, we've always said kind of mid- to high single-digits was kind of the aspirational growth. We've made a lot of investments that the long-term growth rate targets that we have are reinforcing that what we've been doing should enable us to get into that range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMadeline Mollman: This is Madeline Mollman on for Matt Larew. We were just wondering, you said decentralized clinical trial awards were up 62%. Can you contextualize that a little bit? Can you tell us like from what they were growing? And then what do you anticipate that will be in 2022? And what's your win rate there versus standard clinical trials?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So that's a good question. And the growth rate is still off a relatively small base. So if you look at fully decentralized clinical trials is still in the single-digits in terms of the total trials that we have going right now. But as you look at new trial RFPs, most of them actually includes some component that is virtual or hybrid. So we believe that over time, you're going to continue to see that percent increase, albeit for last year and this year, it's not a very significant amount of the total trials that we're running. I would say, more take a look at the five-year outlook, and then it starts to become more significant in terms of the total mix of trials that you have ongoing, particularly if you're looking for fully decentralized clinical trials.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: A follow-up to Derik's question on Drug Development. I appreciate your comments on kind of the long-range plan, but are you able to talk if there's anything that came out of the strategic review in terms of how you might run the business differently, where you may be reinvesting more? I'm just curious what kind of the learnings of the review were. And then also on the long-range plan, the 7% to 10% growth is impressive. A number of the CRO peers are kind of less in 10%-plus growth. So do you see upside to that long-range plan as well?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Good morning. Tycho. First thing I'd say is that when you look at the Drug Development business, we're going to provide additional insights in the second quarter, I think, it would be helpful because you have to look at the mix of the business when you try to compare across different CROs. Our mix of business is different than most because we have a very big central laboratory business. And the central laboratory in general isn't as fast growth as the later-stage clinical trials with an earlier stage. So it's a little bit hard to make those comparisons. When we break apart our businesses and when we look at our competitors, we believe that the long-term guidance that we're providing is very strong. And we also believe when you look at the guidance we're giving is accelerated versus what we've observed in the past because we believe that we're starting to see the success from some of the investments that we've made in the past. But at the same time, as I said earlier, we continue and we will continue to look at all of our avenues for growth, all of our avenues to meet both shareholder returns, but also the needs of our customers as we move forward, and we're committed to continuing to do that. I don't know Glenn if there's any additional context you provide.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, I think when you say you run differently, I think the point that we've made a lot of investments, again, targeted organically and our oncology focus within the business, really, we believe that over time, those organic investments plus, if you will, the PGDx, the Toxikon, the other acquisitions that we have will continue to help fuel the growth in our faster-growing parts of our business.\nTycho Peterson: And then one quick follow-up on oncology. Just why was PGDx the right asset in liquid biopsy? Obviously, there are a number of emerging players in that market. Was it because it got a kitted approach? What kind of stood out from your perspective?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No, that's an important question. And first of all, we have internal capabilities for liquid biopsy. So using our internal experts, we were able to look at what the available assets were out there to decide what we thought would be a good match for what we are developing internally. I think having a kitted solution and having the first one approved by the FDA was important, particularly as we start to think about clinical trials. Kitted solutions might be very helpful in clinical trials. But also as we start to think about taking tests like this globally, which we haven't done before, frankly, but we think there might be the ability for us to globally launch a specialty test like a liquid biopsy. Having the ability to both do a kitted solution and a central laboratory solution was important to us, and PGDx actually has capabilities in both of those areas. So we think it's good for clinical trials. We think it's good for patient care if you can do the test closer to a patient, but it also could enable us to more easily go globally with this type of test. So, are there any last question Chas or that's the end of the questions?\nChas Cook: That's going to be, it.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. So I want to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully you can see that our considerable progress last year coupled with what we have in store for 2022 actually lays a great groundwork for promising not only short-term but also long-term growth. And I just want to say none of it will be possible if it wasn't for all of our colleagues around the world. Our 75,000 employees around the world and each of them play a role ensuring our company delivers on our mission to improve health and improve lives. We look forward to continue to have dialog with you. And please continue to be safe and we'll see you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today. Labcorp is carrying on our mission to improve health and improve lives by harnessing the power of science, technology and innovation. In doing so, we're able to execute against our strategy, to deliver strong results for stakeholders and to effectively respond to global challenges like the pandemic. Our company rounded out an historic 2021 with another strong quarter that sets the stage for further success in 2022 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.77, and free cash flow was $548 million. For the full year, revenue was $16.1 billion, adjusted EPS totaled $28.52, and free cash flow reached $2.6 billion. Our Base Business continued its progress during the quarter, with Diagnostics and Drug Development revenue growing 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively. In Diagnostics, Base Business organic volume increased as esoteric and routine procedures continued their year-over-year growth. Drug Development ended the year with a solid trailing 12-month net book-to-bill of 1.25 and a strong backlog of $15 billion, representing a $579 million increase in the third quarter. Also decentralized clinical trial awards were up 62% over the prior year. Moving to the pandemic. Our ongoing response remains an example of how innovation can drive success. For nearly two years, Labcorp has dedicated significant resources to stemming the spread of the virus. We are proud of the progress we've made thus far, though the rise of variants like Omicron and surges and infection rates make it clear that our work is not over. We continue to leverage Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access, to identify and monitor new variants and to advance vaccine and therapy development. In the fourth quarter, COVID testing volumes were greater than anticipated. We have performed over 74 million tests for COVID to-date, of which approximately 8.6 million were the fourth quarter. This heightened demand continued into the New Year, although volume is significantly less now than in December or in January. Time to results for COVID PCR test remained one to two days on average even during the latest surge. As we've done throughout the pandemic, we are keeping capacity levels high to quickly respond to spikes and testing needs. We are continuing to invest in equipment, elevated staffing levels and our supply chain. In addition, we remain prepared and staffed to support additional drug development work for vaccines, including boosters, or additional therapies. The company's COVID-related innovations in the quarter included the rollout of observed self-collection for COVID PCR testing at over 1,000 patient service centers. And at the start of the fourth quarter, we announced the receipt of FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu at-home collection kit. These offerings are reflective of our work to make COVID testing faster, easier and more accessible. I'll now turn to our enterprise strategy, where we made significant progress in 2021. I'll provide a few highlights that will give you a sense of our growth and our forward momentum. In oncology, we made significant strides in fortifying our position as a leader by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities. At the same time, we followed through on our commitment to improve cancer care access. Last year, we formed our Oncology business unit, and we introduced our Enterprise Oncology offering. Genomic profiling of tumors is key to identifying the best targeted therapy for oncology patients. In December, we announced our agreement to acquire Personal Genome Diagnostics, or PGDx. The company has a strong portfolio of innovative liquid biopsy and tissue-based products, which complement our existing capabilities. Through PGDx-kitted solutions, we can provide oncologists access to tumor profiling at the hospitals where the patients are treated or centralized to one of our laboratories. These solutions may also enable us to expand tumor profiling globally to help our pharmaceutical sponsors find the right novel treatment for patients. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of this year. Other exciting expansions of our oncology test menu included clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer; and OmniSeq INSIGHT, a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for people with late-stage solid tumors. All of these offerings can help physicians make more informed decisions about treatments for their patients and help bring new medicines to market for cancer. In 2021, we intensified our customer focus and embedded technology and data throughout our business. This included improvements to the patient experience in our service centers. These upgrades focused on creating a seamless journey from appointment scheduling to service center visits to easier access to results. Our acquisition of Ovia Health enhanced our position as an important source of information for women's health, which we support through diagnostics, genetic and specialty testing expertise as well as clinical trials. We will continue to identify opportunities to enhance Ovia Health's innovative platform that provides family planning, pregnancy and parenting support. Additionally, we began to deploy Labcorp Diagnostics Assistant. This new tool delivers a detailed view of a patient's lab history along with clinical insights directly to the point of care to inform diagnostic decisions. We opened an automated kit production line in Belgium in the spring. And in the fourth quarter, we opened an integrated laboratory in Singapore, which strengthens our bioanalytical services in the Asia Pacific region. And just this month, we announced the launch of Labcorp OnDemand, which builds on the success of Pixel by LabCorp. This suite of health tests and services offers easy and convenient access to a wide variety of trusted tests. It's another way that Labcorp is meeting people where they are and offering more options for people to stay healthy. We pursued numerous opportunities throughout the year that have long-term and high-growth potential. We did tuck-in deals and strategic acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Ovia Health, PGDx and Myriad Autoimmune's Vectra Test, which analyzes biomarkers to measure rheumatoid arthritis. Yesterday, we announced a comprehensive strategic agreement with Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States. Through our new long-term relationship with Ascension, we will manage its hospital-based laboratories in 10 states, and we will purchase select assets of its outreach laboratory business for approximately $400 million. We expect the first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million from the combined hospital business and lab asset acquisition. While operating margins are expected to be less than segment margins initially, they are expected to improve each year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to our earnings and cash flow in year one and should return its cost of capital by year two. This is a notable opportunity for us and one of the most significant deals of its kind in the sector. It expands our clinical services in several states across the country, and it builds on our strong track record of building similar relationships. The deal with Ascension also underscores our ability to help health systems manage industry-wide shifts. As part of the collaboration, we will explore clinical trial and oncology opportunities that enhance patient access. We look forward to this new partnership and ultimately to welcoming new colleagues to Labcorp. We also reached agreements with other hospitals and hospital systems, including Minnesota-based North Memorial Health. We continue to be excited about our robust M&A pipeline and expect more activity in the coming months. In 2021, we provided the highest-quality service to customers and patients, and we made meaningful investments in our people. In fact, Labcorp has consistently been recognized for the impact of our work and for the value we place on our employees. We were recently named again the Fortune Magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies. And for the fifth consecutive year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation designated Labcorp as the best place to work for LGBTQ+ Equality. We were also named one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2022 by Newsweek. Importantly, in 2021, management and the Board of Directors worked with outside advisors, thoroughly reviewed our structure and capital allocation. As part of the comprehensive review of our structure, we had extensive discussions with third parties, and the Board considered a wide range of options, including significant acquisitions, divestitures, spinning off businesses as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners. The Board unanimously concluded that the company's existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time. That said, we continue to believe that Labcorp shares are not fully valued in the marketplace. To that end, we announced several actions designed to further enhance shareholder value. Among them are the initiation of a dividend starting in the second quarter of 2022 as well as a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, $1 billion of which is being repurchased on an accelerated basis. We are also implementing a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative that targets $350 million in savings over the next three years. And today, in addition to giving 2022 guidance, we will also share a longer-term outlook. And beginning with first quarter results, we will provide additional business insights through enhanced disclosures. Moving forward, we are committed to profitable growth through investments in science, innovation and new technology. As we execute on our strategy, management and Board will continue to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value. In conclusion, our strong Base Business performance, coupled with formidable progress against our strategic priorities in 2021, sets us up for long-term success. This gives us great confidence in our longer-term growth-oriented bright outlook, which Glenn will take you through, along with our 2022 guidance. I am proud of what the team at Labcorp accomplished together in 2021, and I am excited for all that to come this year and into the future as we continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn. Yes. Good morning, Jack. Yes, a couple of things. So first of all, if you look at diagnostics pricing, I'll start with PAMA. There is obviously no impact of PAMA this year. Working through ACLA, which is the trade organization, we're going to continue to fight for a more rational way to think about PAMA in the future. But for our base case, we're assuming that in 2023, there'd be about $100 million impact. And in 2024, it'd be about half of that. So that's kind of what we're thinking for PAMA. In terms of other pricing, we don't see any acceleration of pricing decline. We're going to try to see if there's any way to increase pricing in certain areas. That's not easy. I don't think I would build a lot into the plan for that. But we're also looking at other things like Labcorp OnDemand, where you might have a different type of pricing as you go directly to consumers and so forth. So in general, I would think about the overall pricing pressure continuing, the PAMA pressure being less as we go into the 2024 time frame, and that the underlying base business is where we'll continue to see strong performance. And hopefully, what you can see is that we have a strong commitment to the Base Business in Diagnostics. If you think about COVID, we don't have much built in, if any, frankly, as you start to get into 2024 and beyond, we'll see how that turns out. But it really is all about the Base Business, it's about our ability to continue to grow in our geographies where we're strong. You heard about our deal today with Ascension. It's about doing more of those types of deals. So we think that the future is very bright for Diagnostics and our ability to grow, but it's not through pricing, and there will continue to be pricing pressure. It's more through geographic expansion, hospital deals and continued growth in the segment itself. Yes, so, we've had a very good discussion in partnership with the team at Ascension. It's been really a pleasure to work with them. We've been talking to them for quite some time, frankly. And these are the types of deals that they're long term, strategic in nature. So it takes time. You have to make sure that the cultures are a fit, that the organizations have the same types of culture, and you get to know each other. And that's what these deals tend to take a while before they come to fruition. So we've been talking to our partners there for quite some time now. And what I would say is once we realize the cultural fit, that we could work together well, that there's a focus on patient care and ensuring that the patients get the needs that they - or the services that they need, to ensure that the physicians and the hospitals are able to get the test that they want, to ensure that as new colleagues move over into Labcorp over time that they would have a good experience, that's when we began to get even more and more serious about the partnership and discussions. This is a very large deal. Typically, they're not near as large as this. But again, it's one of many hospital systems that we're talking to, and we continue to feel good about the pipeline. Sure. Good morning, A.J. So I'll give you some context, and I'll give you a sense of how we think about it. So we did 74 million tests for COVID for date - to date, and about 8.5 million, 8.6 million of those in the fourth quarter. So that gives you about 83,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. If you look at the end of the fourth quarter last year, you actually saw significantly higher than the average of 83,000. And in the beginning of January, we actually saw more than at the end of December. So we saw a real peak in the first couple of weeks throughout most of January. If we look at where we are right now, we're actually closer to where we were in the average back in December and back in the fourth quarter. So you've already seen a significant decline in COVID testing. The reason we gave you a range of minus 60% to minus 75% is because there's a multitude of ways to be within that range. One could be that there's another variant, and therefore, you have increase in volume. We don't know when that would happen. Last year, I never would have expected anything to happen in the summer. And we saw something in the summer, and we also saw another surge in the wintertime. As we go through this year, we don't know if there'll be another variant and/or another surge. But the other thing that could be is that the price stays where it is and there's not a surge, and you could get to our range through that. If there is a price decrease, if the emergency is not declared again after April, you could see another surge that would offset a price increase if the emergency situation is released. So as I think about it, I think we're going to continue to see a decline in testing. I personally believe that the emergency situation will be hit through this year, which would keep price relatively consistent. There'll always be pressure on the price. But the range of 60% to 75% would be within multiple different things happening. So it's hard to give you an exact number, A.J., because as we did last year, we gave you our best estimate and each quarter, we changed it based on new information, new data we have. We'll continue to break it out separately so we can inform you of what we're seeing and what we think. But that's the best information we have at this time. Yes. Thank you, Ricky. And we spent a lot of time obviously trying to give you the best information we could because the baselines are a bit tricky as you think about everything that's happened with COVID. So I'll have Glenn give you some additional specifics there. Labor and supply, there's no doubt that we're getting hit with significant inflation. Labor and supply is not something we take lightly. We're watching it very closely, and we're seeing wage increases and supply increases. That's where we put in place the $350 million LaunchPad initiative to help offset that. The issue that occurs, Ricky, is that you get hit with the labor and supply and the wage issues right away, and then it takes you time to get the cost out. So we've given you our guidance over time, and we've given our averages over time. But for example, I think that the first quarter of this year will be harder than by the time we get to the fourth quarter this year because you get hit with all the wage inflation, and we had some weather and with the Omicron variant and so forth. And it takes us some time to get the cost out, which we're working very hard on. That's why we feel confident to give you the 30 million to 50 million basis point improvement on average per year because we feel confident we can do that. But the timing is going to be a little bit different because you get hit hard with the wage and the supply inflation, and then it takes you time to get the cost out. But we assume there will be continued pressure on wages and supply as we go through the long-term outlook. We don't think it's something that's temporary, and that's where we have to continue to find ways reduce costs where we can. And maybe, Glenn, you can give some Phase 5 discussion. Hi, Patrick. Good morning. So our RFPs continue to be very strong, and we continue to get a significant number of RFPs. Discussions with pharma and biotech clients is that they have strong pipelines, and there's a lot that they still need to do to be funded. If you look at our net orders, I mean, we had $7.3 billion in net orders. And our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still above 1.2, which is what we look to be, and it was very strong for the quarter itself. You look at our backlog, it's $15 billion, so it's almost 9% increase versus last year. And about $5 billion of that backlog we expect to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. So every indication we have is that the RFPs, the funding remains strong for us to be within the range of growth that we expect to be in the long-term outlook that we gave to you. In terms of China, China remains a very important market for pharma. I believe that they will continue to be an important growth market. So therefore, we have a significant presence there. We're able to perform studies there. We built significant organic in terms of people and capabilities in the country, and I think it was the right thing to do, and it will show that it will continue to be the right thing to do over time. And I'll give you some context, and I'll ask Glenn to jump in with some numbers as well. So first of all, we're excited about this opportunity, and we think that it is a great opportunity for not just the patients that Ascension serves and a long-term relationship that we'll have with them. But we expect the first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million from their hospital business and the lab asset acquisition. What I would say is we work with them on what they wanted to do at the time in terms of the size and the scale of the partnership. And we believe there will be opportunities for us to work together in many different ways as we go into the future, not just with hospital work, by the way. And we're going to explore clinical trial work together, oncology opportunities that enhance patient access. So there's lots of opportunities for us as we go into the future. I don't want to speak too much about them and their percent of revenue. So for, I think that's something you would need to ask Ascension. But what we can tell you is that we believe that this long-term partnership is going to be very, very fruitful for both organizations. Glenn, do you want to give a little further context? Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. When we went through the strategic review, we looked at everything, and we were very thorough. I mean we spent almost a year evaluating all the alternatives, talking to people externally, making sure that we looked at not just structure but capital allocation. And after that entire process, the Board unanimously agreed that at this time, the structure is right. But we also realized and believed that our shares are not still fully valued in the marketplace. And we're doing a lot of things in terms of capital allocation and additional disclosures and long-term guidance, which we think will help with shareholder return. We believe that this should help more fully value the shares in the marketplace. But we also agree as a management and Board that we should always be looking at alternative scenarios and we should always be open if there's other things over time that makes sense. So it's another way of us acknowledging that it's not a one-and-done type of analysis. It's an analysis that you continually do, you continually refresh, you continually look at where you are, how you're performing, how things in the marketplace are evolving. So that's all you're hearing at the moment. We're going to continue to look at our options as anybody would expect you to do. The only thing I would say, Kevin, as I mentioned, in January, you had a lot of weather. You had a lot of Omicron where even some of our employees weren't able to get in to open up service centers. And with Drug Development, we had - you have to charge for people when they work, but if people aren't working because they're ill - we faced issues that you saw in almost every business in the United States. So, first quarter is going to be probably one of the tougher quarters versus the other quarters in the year. But all that's been taken into full evaluation. And as we provided our guidance for 2022 and longer-term, we've looked at all of that. So other than that, I think things look strong, and we continue to be optimistic about the guidance and where we are. Yes. So I'll start off with, there's no doubt that we're seeing inflation and we're seeing wage inflation, but also material costs going up and those things. But that's why we put in place the $350 million of cost savings. And it's not going to be $100 million, $100 million, $100 million over three years. We're going to try to get as much as we can out in the first year and then do more in the following years. The timing, as I mentioned earlier, will be a little bit different. The pressure hits you right away, but you take out the costs as you go through the year. And to give you a sense, the type of things that we're looking at, for example, are in our diagnostic area. Right now, you might assess a sample, meaning log it into the system in one area. And then you might have to fly it to another lab in a different part of the country. And then there might be another test that you have to do in another lab. We're looking at ways to streamline that so you get the results faster, but you wouldn't have the sample moving around as often. It's good for your ESG goals, but it also is good for patients and ultimately could reduce cost. So we're looking at those type of initiatives, which ultimately could reduce cost, but doesn't happen in a matter of days. It takes a little bit of time to kind of reshuffle reorganize what you're trying to do. But we have a lot of initiatives like that, that we're putting things like our automated propel system that we're going to put in additional laboratories, it can reduce cost. It's less wage pressure, because it doesn't take as many people necessary to run, but also you can get better quality, faster results at time. So we're looking for things to fundamentally change some of our business processes, and that's why it takes a little bit longer. But that's also why we're confident that we can deliver on the 30 to 50 basis point improvement in margin over time if you look at it on average. Sure, Derik. I'll give you a little bit. Glenn can jump in. The first thing I'd tell you, Derik, is that we're going to give some additional disclosures when we report our first quarter earnings in April. So I think that will be helpful. We do that at that time. But clearly, when you look at the growth, I mean, a lot of the growth is coming from the later-stage clinical trial business. We see great opportunities there. We've invested in there with things like GlobalCare as well as snapIOT to give us good capabilities in terms of decentralized clinical trials, which are becoming more and more important. We've built our presence in Japan and in China in that business. So you'll see - and we believe that's an area that we can get very significant growth and also margin improvement. And then if you look at the Central laboratory business, we're a leader there, and we continue to feel strong in that business. But because you're a leader, the ability to grow isn't necessarily as easy as the ability to grow in area like clinical trials, where we're not yet where we want to be in terms of leadership. And then the last thing I'd say is that our early-stage business is a smaller business. I mean we're still able to compete. We have the ability to compete effectively in that business, but it's not the size or the magnitude of the other two businesses. We do expect strong growth in that business but at a scale that's smaller than the first two businesses. Yes. So that's a good question. And the growth rate is still off a relatively small base. So if you look at fully decentralized clinical trials is still in the single-digits in terms of the total trials that we have going right now. But as you look at new trial RFPs, most of them actually includes some component that is virtual or hybrid. So we believe that over time, you're going to continue to see that percent increase, albeit for last year and this year, it's not a very significant amount of the total trials that we're running. I would say, more take a look at the five-year outlook, and then it starts to become more significant in terms of the total mix of trials that you have ongoing, particularly if you're looking for fully decentralized clinical trials. Yes. Good morning. Tycho. First thing I'd say is that when you look at the Drug Development business, we're going to provide additional insights in the second quarter, I think, it would be helpful because you have to look at the mix of the business when you try to compare across different CROs. Our mix of business is different than most because we have a very big central laboratory business. And the central laboratory in general isn't as fast growth as the later-stage clinical trials with an earlier stage. So it's a little bit hard to make those comparisons. When we break apart our businesses and when we look at our competitors, we believe that the long-term guidance that we're providing is very strong. And we also believe when you look at the guidance we're giving is accelerated versus what we've observed in the past because we believe that we're starting to see the success from some of the investments that we've made in the past. But at the same time, as I said earlier, we continue and we will continue to look at all of our avenues for growth, all of our avenues to meet both shareholder returns, but also the needs of our customers as we move forward, and we're committed to continuing to do that. I don't know Glenn if there's any additional context you provide. Yes. No, that's an important question. And first of all, we have internal capabilities for liquid biopsy. So using our internal experts, we were able to look at what the available assets were out there to decide what we thought would be a good match for what we are developing internally. I think having a kitted solution and having the first one approved by the FDA was important, particularly as we start to think about clinical trials. Kitted solutions might be very helpful in clinical trials. But also as we start to think about taking tests like this globally, which we haven't done before, frankly, but we think there might be the ability for us to globally launch a specialty test like a liquid biopsy. Having the ability to both do a kitted solution and a central laboratory solution was important to us, and PGDx actually has capabilities in both of those areas. So we think it's good for clinical trials. We think it's good for patient care if you can do the test closer to a patient, but it also could enable us to more easily go globally with this type of test. So, are there any last question Chas or that's the end of the questions? Okay. So I want to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully you can see that our considerable progress last year coupled with what we have in store for 2022 actually lays a great groundwork for promising not only short-term but also long-term growth. And I just want to say none of it will be possible if it wasn't for all of our colleagues around the world. Our 75,000 employees around the world and each of them play a role ensuring our company delivers on our mission to improve health and improve lives. We look forward to continue to have dialog with you. And please continue to be safe and we'll see you soon. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment, our 2022 full year guidance and then conclude with our longer-term outlook through 2024. Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year, due to declines in organic revenue of 10.3% and divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.6% and favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points. The 10.3% decline in organic revenue was driven by a 15.3% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5% increase in the company's organic base business. Operating income for the quarter was $731 million, or 18% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $93 million of amortization and $79 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $902 million or 22.2% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion or 31.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. Excluding COVID testing, the Base Business compared to the Base Business last year experienced higher adjusted operating income and margins due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.6% compared to 24.8% last year. Going forward, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform. Net earnings for the quarter were $553 million or $5.75 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.77 in the quarter, down from $10.56 last year. Operating cash flow was $698 million in the quarter compared to $775 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $150 million compared to $99 million last year. And as a result, free cash flow was $548 million in the quarter compared to $675 million last year. During the quarter, we used $1 billion of our cash flow for our accelerated share repurchase program and invested $171 million on acquisitions. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 16.9% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 17.8%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.7% and favorable foreign currency translation of 20 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 21.8% reduction from COVID testing, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the Base Business revenue was 5%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 8.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 8.9%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 14.6% decline in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in the Base Business. Price/mix decreased 8.2% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 7.2% and lower Base Business of 1.6%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5% and currency of 0.2%. Diagnostics organic base business revenue growth was 7.2% compared to its Base Business last year, with 8.1% coming from volume, partially offset by a 1% decline from price/mix. The price/mix decline was primarily due to the recovery of our Canadian business, which carries a lower average requisition price. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $776 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 39.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year, primarily due to a volume decline of approximately 50% while the company continued to maintain capacity. Base Business margins were higher compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Diagnostics achieved its goal to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings from its three-year LaunchPad initiative. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to last year due to organic base business growth of 7.9% and acquisitions of 0.3%, partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its centralized business of 4% and divestitures of 0.3%. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 9.9%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $206 million, or 14.2% of revenue compared to $248 million, or 17.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to lower COVID testing. In the Base Business, higher personnel and other inflationary costs as well as investments in oncology capabilities were partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. We continue to exclude the enterprise component of Drug Development bonus expense, which is reflected in corporate unallocated and totaled $11 million for the quarter. While margins were down in the quarter, they were up for the full year compared to 2020, and we expect margins to continue to increase in 2022. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.3 billion and 1.25, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. And we expect approximately $5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2022 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2021, for the full year. In addition, the guidance includes the softness we experienced in January due to Omicron, which we expect will rebound through the rest of the quarter. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends, which we will initiate in the second quarter. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 1.5% to 6.5% compared to 2021. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 7.5% to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 75%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 11.5% to 17.5% compared to 2021. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 3.5% to 6%. COVID testing revenue is expected to decline 60% to 75%. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.4%, primarily driven by organic growth in both volume and price mix. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 7% to 9.5% compared to 2021. This guidance includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 7.5% to 10% compared to 2021. Given the amount of capacity we have within Diagnostics, we've assumed that no COVID testing will be performed in Drug Development central lab business in 2022. We expect to benefit from broad-based growth in all three businesses, helping drive continued margin improvement in the segment. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11.3%. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $17.25 to $21.25 compared to 2021 adjusted EPS of $28.52. The adjusted EPS guidance reflects the expectation of lower COVID testing in 2022, while the Base Business continues to profitably grow. Free cash flow is expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2021. Now I'll discuss our longer-term outlook, which reflects our current view of the business from 2022 to 2024. We expect enterprise Base Business organic revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 7% compared to 2021. We also expect revenue growth from acquisitions to represent additional annual growth of 2% to 3%. We expect Diagnostics Base Business organic revenue to grow at a 2.5% to 4.5% CAGR compared to 2021. This outlook is higher than historical growth driven by a continued recovery in our Base Business relative to 2021, broad-based growth, including hospitals and health systems, and the lower incremental impact of PAMA in the outlook period. We expect Drug Development Base Business organic revenue to grow at a 7% to 10% CAGR compared to 2021. This outlook is higher than our historical growth, and we have added capacity and inorganic investments in the last few years in our faster-growing early development and late-stage clinical businesses. As we continue to emphasize profitable growth, we expect enterprise margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points on average annually through the outlook period compared to 2021, which was approximately 14.5%. This margin expansion is due in part to the company's LaunchPad initiative, which is expected to deliver $350 million of cost savings over the time period to help offset inflationary costs. And finally, we expect adjusted EPS to grow at an 11% to 14% CAGR compared to 2020 - 2019 adjusted EPS of $11.32. We continue to use 2019 as the base year comparison for earnings growth to better reflect the earnings power of the company, excluding COVID testing. The adjusted EPS outlook reflects the expectation that both base businesses will continue to profitably grow organically. In addition, we expect to benefit from capital allocation directed towards accretive acquisitions and share repurchases while keeping within our targeted gross debt leverage of 2.5 to 3 times. For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 fourth quarter and full year results, 2022 guidance and our longer-term outlook. In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our Base Business. For 2022, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the year. In addition, our longer-term outlook is expected to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth driven by top line growth, margin improvement and capital allocation. Operator, we'll now take questions. Yes, Jack, the only thing I'd add to the discussion was just that when you look at the guidance that we provided or the outlook for the longer-term, what you see is obviously good top line growth across the businesses, supplemented by obviously acquisitions from capital allocation, but that we do expect to see margin improvement over this period of time and net margin improvement coming from both businesses. So to your point, helping offset some of the inflationary costs as well as PAMA, at least that's in, call it, 2023 and potentially beyond that. And that it's really also then utilizing our balance sheet and our free cash flow. So we expect to be back within our targeted leverage of that 2.5 times to three times over that period of time. So using that cash flow to support acquisitions that, again, will be targeted at least 2% to 3% and then dividends, and then obviously, with the remainder going back to returning capital through our share repurchase program. Yes. A.J., the only thing... I would add just additionally for your modeling purposes, as you would expect, that we expect the strongest period to be in the first quarter and then obviously going on as the year unfolds. But wide range of outcomes, but the trend clearly to be lower, call it, in the second half than what we would expect in the first half at this time. Yes. Hi, Ricky. The reason why, obviously, we chose to do a growth rate off of 2019 was to get to a pre-pandemic level and that we expect that by the end of the, call it, the long-term horizon, COVID will be de minimis into that number. So that was kind of the double-digit growth rate that we would expect at the 11% to 14% CAGR. We did comment because - on revenue, we can go off of a 21% base, because we distinguish between COVID revenue and Base Business revenue. But when we were talking about margins, just to show that we do expect to see margin improvement over the time, we did comment that you would get to roughly around a 14.5% margin in 2021 from the Base Business. And again, the reason why we say that's an estimate is because there's a lot of shared resources that are supporting both the COVID business and the Base Business, but it's a proxy. And if you just took that further down and set as a proxy, that 14.5% on your Base Business margin would get you to roughly, call it, around a $14 a share number from an adjusted EPS from the Base Business. So either you use the base estimate in, call it, 2021 of earnings and growing double-digits or the base of 2019, which is a clean number for our Base Business, you still get to roughly the same trend in that 22% from a base business and beyond. We do expect double-digit growth in each of the periods going forward within that outlook horizon. Yes. No, I agree. And Eric, what we did put in the release was that the assets that we're acquiring, the Outreach Labs, would have had year revenue of approximately $150 million and that by putting in the full year annualized revenues, as Adam said, the $550 million to $600 million, that, that $150 million, we're taking on some compression with it but then growth from it as well. Would size up what we got within the outreach business versus the strategic partnership of managing the in-hospital labs being the difference. Yes. Eric, what I would say is, again, with the revenues that we're picking up, to your point, there is compression. Again, that comes with the outreach labs that we have, and that's reflected and we said approximately $150 million. But it will be compressed and then we'll grow. So it does give you at least an indication of the mix, if you will. From a pricing, again, similarly, we expect to have normal, call it, pricing kind of margins that would come with the outreach. But with the in-hospital labs, to your point, they are at a lower price point. So when you look at the mix impact, and Adam commented in his remarks, that strategic partnership of this size with that much going from the in-hospital lab management, you would expect to see lower than, obviously, segment margins. But the positive is that once we start there the first year and we see that margin compression, we expect to then see that grow and improve through efficiencies and productivity and so forth. So dilutive to margins for sure. Obviously, it's a transaction that we think from a return standpoint is very attractive. Excited about the strategic partnership, excited about the potential additional growth that could occur with that partnership over time. That will continue to drive good returns for the company and margins that will improve over time. So first, to your point, the growth rate is a little bit higher than our historical organic growth within the business. But a lot of that is with the investments that we've made and the growth and the focus of the strategic growth, such as the hospital systems and so forth, where we continue to find opportunities to see additional growth. Those CAGRs, if you will, are based upon 2021, which again would not have been, call it, a fully recovered year. So we get some of the benefits of that growth. The recent acquisitions that we've done that have been already, call it, in the base, so not new acquisitions but ones that have done, not necessarily have been fully annualized. We continue to get some additional growth from that. The fact that our expectation for PAMA that in the outlook period's less impactful than what it had been historically for us continues that. And just the overall efficiencies, LaunchPad that supports the topline growth as well. So we think we're on a good cadence and good momentum to be able to hit those numbers over the planning horizon. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the components of the businesses, to your point, early development and the late-stage clinical businesses have historically are higher-growth businesses than the Central Lab business. And so we've made a lot of investments in capacity to continue to be able to fuel that growth in those two areas in particular. The acquisitions that we've done, whether it's Toxicon, GlobalCare, snapIOT have been targeted in the higher-growth areas within ED and Central Lab or in late stage rather. So just the mix of our business continues to be more weighted towards the faster-growing parts that we've made. So overall, we've always said kind of mid- to high single-digits was kind of the aspirational growth. We've made a lot of investments that the long-term growth rate targets that we have are reinforcing that what we've been doing should enable us to get into that range. Yes. No, I think when you say you run differently, I think the point that we've made a lot of investments, again, targeted organically and our oncology focus within the business, really, we believe that over time, those organic investments plus, if you will, the PGDx, the Toxikon, the other acquisitions that we have will continue to help fuel the growth in our faster-growing parts of our business."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chas Cook, VP, Investor Relations. Please begin.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Labcorp's third quarter 2021 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2021 guidance and the related assumptions, the projected impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. At Labcorp, we continue to leverage innovation, science and technology to accelerate our strategy as we work to improve health and improve lives around the world. We serve as a trusted source of health information that helps customers advance health care and guide medical decisions. At the same time, we've remained focused on helping the world through the pandemic. In the third quarter, we delivered strong results. Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted EPS reached $6.82, and free cash flow was $650 million. As a result of our strong performance and our improved outlook, we're raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Glenn will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. The Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well with 10% and 22% growth, respectively. We saw consistent recovery across both businesses. In Diagnostics, we experienced broad geographic recovery in our Base Business and across our testing portfolio. Esoteric and routine testing demonstrated solid year-over-year growth for the quarter. The trailing 12 month net book-to-bill for Drug Development remains strong at 1.34. Drug Development continues to recover with nearly 85% of sites now open. The business also saw decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year. Now I'd like to turn to our ongoing role in the pandemic response. Labcorp continues to support the fight against the pandemic in every way possible through both our diagnostic and our drug development capabilities. We experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year. Time to results for COVID test remains an average of one to two days, with results typically available within one day. PCR testing volume averaged 85,000 per day in the quarter, up from 54,000 per day in the second quarter. We averaged 114,000 tests per day in September, with volumes declining week-over-week since that time. We will continue to break out COVID testing from Base Business revenue and volume as it remains difficult to forecast. We will also continue to maintain high capacity levels to be prepared for potential future scenarios. We also had another successful quarter of bringing new innovations to market. Notably, we recently received Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit. With flu season upon us, the kit offers a convenient way to test for both viruses. This new offering will be available for adults and children ages two and over and no upfront cost for those who meet clinical guidelines. In addition, we collaborated with AstraZeneca on both a COVID prevention and treatment trial of its new long-acting antibody combination. In the trial, the investigational antibody combination demonstrated statistically significant benefit in preventing symptomatic COVID and in reducing severe COVID or death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID, promising milestones in the development of new treatments. Also earlier this month, Merck filed for FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID in at-risk adults, a treatment that we supported through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. I'll now discuss progress on our strategy, and I'll start with oncology. The OmniSeq integration is going as planned, and their leading pan-cancer diagnostic capabilities extend our portfolio of solutions in this area. Additionally, we launched clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer. As part of our efforts to address healthy equity - health equity issues, we recently partnered with the Community Clinical Oncology Research Network to assess social and economic impacts of cancer care disparities. And we also recently began work with Pillar Biosciences to enhance our next-generation sequencing and plan to offer a specialty oncology assay. During the quarter, we advanced our commitment to intensifying our customer focus and embedding technology and data throughout our business. We acquired Ovia Health, a leading digital platform trusted by millions of women for family planning, pregnancy and parenting support. Ovia Health extends our position as a go-to source for women's health insights through our deep expertise in diagnostic, genetic and specialty testing. Additionally, we are working with several organizations to begin deploying Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant, which delivers comprehensive lab results and clinical insights directly to the point of care. We're also using technology to improve health for low-income individuals and families. We partnered with Medical Home Network to incorporate lab testing results into the records of Medicaid safety net patients. And lastly, through a collaboration with Medidata, we are utilizing digital biomarkers with drug, vaccine and device trials to enhance our decentralized clinical trialing offers. Pursuing opportunities with long-term, high-growth potential remains a focus. Our recent acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Myriad's Vectra test for rheumatoid arthritis and Ovia Health advance our position in key growth markets. We're making progress on our integrations, and we welcome new team members who joined Labcorp. Our M&A pipeline remains robust. We expect continued activity on this front for the balance of fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2022. Importantly, Labcorp continues to be recognized for the significant work we do. Just this month, we were named by Forbes as one of the world's best employers in 2021. In addition, Informa Pharma Intelligence selected Labcorp as a finalist for Best Contract Research Organization of the Year. These recognitions are only possible thanks to our diverse and talented workforce, which is at the core of our ability to innovate. Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the Board and management team's ongoing assessment of the company's structure and capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to ensuring Labcorp is best positioned to unlock shareholder value while offering patients and customers the support that they've come to expect. Working closely with our advisers, we have made significant progress on assessing both our capital allocation and our structure. And as previously shared, we expect to update you on our conclusions in this quarter. To summarize, our Base Business in both Diagnostics and Drug Development had a strong third quarter and is well-positioned for continued success. We remain dedicated to the fight against COVID, all while delivering on our strategy and carrying out our mission. I'm excited by the progress we've made and for what lies ahead. With that, Glenn will take you through the details of our third quarter results.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year due to organic growth of 3.4%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 50 basis points. The 3.4% increase in organic revenue is driven by a 10.2% increase in the company's organic Base business partially offset by a 6.8% decrease in COVID testing. Operating income for the quarter was $767 million or 18.9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $92 million of amortization and $48 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $907 million or 22.3% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 29.7% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased Base Business demand and a tight labor market as the company continues to invest in its workforce. Partially offsetting these headwinds were the benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.4% compared to 25.7% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. Net earnings for the quarter were $587 million or $6.05 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.82 in the quarter, down from $8.41 last year. Operating cash flow was $767 million in the quarter compared to $786 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million or 2.9% of revenue compared to $77 million or 2% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $650 million in the quarter compared to $709 million last year. During the quarter, we used $300 million of our cash flow for our share repurchase program and invested $292 million on acquisitions. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 3.2% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 3.9%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 30 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 9.7% reduction from COVID testing partially offset by a 5.8% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.7%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume increased 0.2% over last year as acquisition volume contributed 0.2% and organic volume decreased by 0.1%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 5.9% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.9% increase in the Base Business. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.1% to our organic Base Business volume growth. Price mix decreased 3.4% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 3.8% partially offset by currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Diagnostics organic Base Business revenue growth was 9% compared to its Base Business last year, with 7.7% coming from volume and 1.3% coming from price mix, which was primarily due to an increase in test per session. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $775 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1 billion or 37.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction of COVID testing and higher personnel costs partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, Base Business margins were down slightly due to the negative impact from PAMA. Diagnostics 3 year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of this year. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 17.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 19.9%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. This was partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its central lab business of 3.5% and divestitures of 0.3%. Drug Development's Base Business benefited from broad-based growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic work. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 11.4% primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $226 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $210 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings partially offset by lower COVID testing and higher personnel costs. The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to lower COVID testing. Excluding the impact from COVID testing, operating margins would have been up compared to last year. For comparability to peers, Drug Development earnings exclude $36 million of expense related to the enterprise component of its bonus, which is included in unallocated corporate expense. We expect full year margins to be up over 2020, which were up over 2019. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.8 billion and 1.34, respectively. During the quarter, orders were negatively impacted by approximately $150 million due to a significant scope change, which decreased the book-to-bill. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.4 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to last year. We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2021, for the remainder of the year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong third quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14% from prior guidance of 6.5% to 9%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 18.5% to 19.5%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 11% to down 6%. We are raising our expectations for revenue to grow in Diagnostics by 8% to 10% from prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 2%. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 16% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is expected to be down 11% to down 6%. We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 19.5% to 20.5% from prior guidance of 17% to 19%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 170 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 21.5% to 22.5%. Given the improved top line growth expectations, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $26 to $28, up from prior guidance of $21.5 to $25. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion. For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 third quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results. In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic, while also growing our Base Business. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the remainder of the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: So I know you're not providing 2022 guidance, but could you maybe provide some high-level thoughts on headwinds and tailwinds for each business going into next year? And in that context, maybe address any labor inflation pressures that we should consider while we're modelling? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. Good morning. Ann, again, we're not, as you said, providing guidance for 2022, but as I look at 2022, I think there are things that you've seen this quarter that you can kind of start to think about 2022. First of all, the Base Business for both Drug Development and Diagnostics is rebounding well. And if you look even for the first couple of weeks of October, that rebounded from where we were even in September. So we would expect the Base Business to continue to improve. At the same time, we've said before, we actually have several things that we're looking at when it comes to cost. One is we kept our headcount at a level that is higher than we typically would to ensure that we're prepared for whatever scenario could occur with COVID. And by the way, I'm glad we did that. If you would have gone back to the second quarter where we averaged 55,000 PCR tests, there was good reason to say we should reduce headcount because we saw tests going down. We didn't do that. And then when the tests came to 110,000 or so per day in the month of September, we still had a one day turnaround time for the majority of tests. So we're going to continue to keep our labor costs a bit higher based upon number of people to ensure that we're prepared for any scenario. And that's for both Diagnostics and Drug Development. I said Drug Development continues to rebound. 85% of sites are now open, but that still means 15% of sites are not open. We're continuing to keep that headcount because these people are hard to retain, they're hard to train, and we believe the business will come back. Separate and distinct from that, we are seeing impacts in certain materials and people-related costs, and we're seeing that through the supply chain constraints but also a very tight labor market. I don't think it's any different than what our peers are seeing. Everybody is seeing the same thing. So we're focused on maintaining our operational continuity, and we're going to continue to look for ways to reduce expenses. Now the increased material costs and increased labor costs, if you - very quickly, it takes us time to take out the expenses, but we're going to continue to find ways, to find efficiencies and reduce costs wherever we can to offset those things. I think the biggest factor, again, going to 2022 is what happens with COVID and COVID testing. And when we provide guidance, we're going to break out the guidance for COVID testing like we did this year so that we can give you a range of possibilities, and then we'll also give you what we believe the range of opportunities would be for the Base Business. And then the last thing I would say is we also are working on our capital allocation and that we are doing - continuing to do M&A, and we have a significant pipeline as we go into next year. I'm very excited about the pipeline of M&A that we have, and we'll continue to do share repos where appropriate. So hopefully, that gives you some kind of context of how we're thinking about next year. I think that we have good momentum as we go into the year.\nAnn Hynes: Okay, great. Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: On the strategic review, if you'll humor me, you're now, I think, around nine months into the review and expect to conclude this quarter. Are there still significant items at this point related to the business structure which are being evaluated? And what's your level of confidence that one way or another, you're going to be able to find a way to get better credit for the value of the businesses versus where your peers trade? And then just one procedural point. Any comment on what type of form you're going to choose for disclosing the results?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So let me give you some additional context. And I appreciate the question, Jack. So first of all, I want to start off by saying that we believe that there is intrinsic value in Labcorp that's yet to be realized, we believe that. And we're working closely with our outside advisers, and we have several of them. And we're also working with our Board of Directors to evaluate our structure and capital allocation as you know. We are making significant progress to ensure that we find a way to best position Labcorp on lap  the shareholder value. I can tell you, Jack, we are performing a very thorough and a very thoughtful analysis. And it just takes time to fully assess all of the alternatives, and we continue to assess all of the alternatives. Though we're not giving any additional updates today, we are looking forward to share the conclusions once the review is complete, and we still expect that to happen in this quarter. We haven't - I want to reach the conclusions, and then we'll figure out exactly how we communicate it on a very broad, direct basis. So as we reach the conclusions, then we'll think about how to best broadly communicate our decisions.\nJack Meehan: Great. Then one on the business in the quarter. Just wanted to talk about bookings in Drug Development. The trailing 12-month metrics look good, but my back-of-the-envelope math would suggest the quarterly awards were down year-over-year. So just curious how you're feeling about RFP flow in the quarter and win rates. Anything you would call out, which would make the year-over-year comparison look negative?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. I'll give you some context, and then I'll ask Glenn to provide additional context. So we still have a strong book-to-bill, it was 1.34, and we've always said that a 1.2 or above gets you high single - mid to high single digit growth. So anything above a 1.2, we think, is a very strong book-to-bill. And I've said time and time again, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter. I look at the trailing 12 months because it gives you a better understanding over time. And with book-to-bill, it could be lumpy. So you could fall in one quarter this year and fall out into a different quarter versus next year. So the quarterly, we try to watch carefully, obviously, but I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from one quarter versus another. What I look at is the RFPs, which continue to be very strong, and we continue to do very well as we go through the RFPs. So if you look at the trailing 12 month net orders, they were $7.8 billion. They were up 27% year-over-year. And if you look at the backlog, it was $14.4 billion. That increased by over $100 million in the second quarter, and that was up 15% year-over-year. So I think there's still strength there that you can see. But again, I focus on the trailing 12 month and I think above 1.2 is where you want to be. I don't know, Glenn, if you want to talk about some of the quarter fluctuations.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. And Jack, in our remarks, we talked about this change in scope that we had that was $150 million that obviously negatively impacted the quarter. So as Adam said, when you put it in the perspective of the trailing 12 months, it gets kind of rounded out, if you will. We still have strong levels of backlog, strong levels of orders. To your point, while our orders on a trailing 12 would have been up around 27% year-on-year, including the scope change for the quarter, we would have been down slightly, down around 4%. However, what's interesting is that we actually received the order in the third quarter of a year ago. So it really has kind of a double effect. If you back it out of the year that we received it, the third quarter, and you take it out of now the change from the third quarter of this, would actually would have been up around 13% in orders, excluding it for the quarter. So it still reinforces, frankly, from our perspective, why we really focus on the trailing 12 because even with the volatility, you really get a sense of the true growth and the future potential of the business.\nJack Meehan: That will make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. And thanks for taking my call. I want to talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline. You obviously are excited about it. Are we talking about more focus in diagnostics, are we more focused in clinical? Take me through sort of where the opportunities lie. And are we talking about technologies on the diagnostics side or market share? Can you - any more color on what the pipeline looks like now and how it might be different than what it was a year ago or two years ago?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. Sure, Kevin. Good morning. First of all, we remain excited, as you said, about the pipeline that we have. And we continue to see the ability to acquire hospital, local, regional laboratories, and that kind of makes a lot of sense. They're accretive in the first year, typically. They return their cost of capital very quickly, and we know how to integrate those, and we see significant potential for that as we go through this year into next year. I've said before, those sometimes take longer than I would expect, but the good news is that we continue to have a very strong pipeline. And I'm confident that we're going to have some really interesting things that we can do with regard to those types of acquisitions. Then we look for strategic acquisitions, and those can be something like Ovia, where it's a digital platform that enhances our capabilities in technology and digitalization, but it's also in a very important high growth market where we have a very strong share in women's health. And then you look at things that we've done before, like SnapIOT or GlobalCare, where it gives us strategic capabilities in drug development. I mentioned that the decentralized clinical trials that we're doing were 50% higher year-over-year, and we're going to need more capabilities and more technology in areas like that. So I kind of separate it into three buckets. The diagnostic laboratory acquisition opportunities, then the strategic opportunities for both diagnostics and for drug development, and we've got multiple different things that we're looking at in each of those areas.\nKevin Caliendo: Has anything changed from the seller's perspective, in your opinion, around the diagnostics, the hospital acquisitions and the like? Is their environment tougher or are they - are you being more aggressive? Has anything materially changed in terms of the buy, sell algorithm?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. I think their environments are tough. I also think that with COVID, they've realized they had to update a lot of their machinery in order to do the COVID testing if they want to do it in a hospital. They had to take a look at how they were using their capital. And they realized that running their laboratory might not be core to what they do every day, and they probably would do better if they had another surgical operating suite or put their money towards something like that versus updating laboratory equipment. So as we have more and more discussions with the hospitals and hospital systems and local laboratories, I think the realization is that diagnostics does take capital, in order to have the right machinery, you have to run that machinery often to get the best output and margins through running that type of equipment; and that we can do it extraordinarily well for them. So I think all 3 of those things have led to us having a more robust pipeline now than what I've seen in the past.\nKevin Caliendo: Is there any - just one quick last follow-up to that. Is there any impact that your M&A pipeline has on the strategic review or vice versa? Meaning, can you run both of those separately? Or are they any way intertwined?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So we're continuing to execute on our strategy today, and we're doing a very thorough and thoughtful strategic review. We're making sure that, of course, we consider both as we move forward, but it's not getting in the way of us doing what we need to do to run our business and be successful, execute in the marketplace today. And hopefully, what you see when you look at our numbers is that we're executing extraordinarily well in both Diagnostics and Drug Development. And we're continuing to do M&A as we showed with what we bought from Myriad for the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Ovia, OmniSeq. But at the same time, we're making progress on the strategic review.\nKevin Caliendo: Okay, thanks so much.\\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So clearly, there - COVID is going to be the biggest swing factor, Adam, to your point next year. But how should we think about what's the right earnings base to think about for next year? I think maybe for us, could be easiest if you can exclude sort of the impact of COVID this year and kind of we start what's the right baseline for next year? And then also, I know you haven't provided sort of long-term earning targets for some time now. Is this going to be also part of the strategic -- unveiling the strategic review? Will you give us long-term growth goals?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. Thank you, Ricky. Good morning. So first of all, as baseline, I tend to look at 2019 and go pre-pandemic. And then I look at what the growth would have been if everything was normalized. And that's kind of just how I think about how to grow the Base Business as we move into the future. I'd be very careful comparing versus 2020 or 2021 because the Base Business was recovering, the COVID testing was different. For example, as we saw COVID testing grow significantly in September, we saw an impact on the Base Business in September. It was slightly less than August. Now we see COVID tested less for the first couple of weeks of October. We've seen the Base Business now nearly flat to where it was in 2019. So using 2020, 2021, I'd say you have to be really thoughtful and careful with that. I use 2019 as the baseline to figure out where we should kind of get from a normalized perspective as we look at next year. And then with regard to long-term guidance, we're looking at everything as we go through the strategic review, and we're discussing all options for structure as well as capital allocation and how we communicate those things. So we haven't reached a conclusion on that, Ricky, but I can tell you, we are considering all of it.\nRicky Goldwasser: Okay. And then just one follow-up, I think you mentioned that the Base Business is almost flat versus 2019. What are the sort of the variability between the different geographic regions? And when we think about 2019, is that sort of the 2019 exit run rate or just on a full year basis?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Ricky, it's Glenn. As we've seen even currently, so you can use it as a run rate or you can look at it for the full year, both businesses' top line revenues are kind of at the high end of historical levels compared to '19. So we really feel good about the current levels of performance. What's interesting and unique, and I think a little bit to your question within the Diagnostics business, is that we're keeping our revenues at the same level of growth compared to '19, but we're doing it through price/mix because effectively, our volume levels have been plus or minus relatively flat to '19. So as we go forward, obviously, we would expect volume to continue to tick up and go above '19 levels but obviously, see a corresponding decline, if you will, in tests or price mix, which has been driven by tests per session that have been higher than normal given people have had fewer visits. But overall, to Adam's comment, as we look to pre-pandemic levels, both businesses are kind of tracking well to it, albeit, you can argue, the mix of how we're getting there is a little bit different.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nJustin Bowers: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Can you just give us an update on kind of the mix of COVID or vaccine-related orders or backlog for Drug Development?\nAdam Schechter: Sure. Good morning, Justin. The first thing I'd say is that's important because as you think about last year, we had a significant amount, between 10% and 15%, that we discussed of the book-to-bill on COVID. And a lot of those studies were in third and fourth quarter of last year, and they happened very quickly because everybody was working as fast as they could to enroll those trials, get the results of the trials so that we can get the vaccines and the therapeutics to market as fast. So you're burning through those studies faster than you typically would. If you look at where we currently are, the mix is much less COVID right now. It's less than 5%, frankly, of the total that we have for the backlog. So it's significantly less than it was before. We are still doing some work. But again, as you start to think about future comparisons, you just have to remember, third and fourth quarter of last year had significant COVID studies in them.\nJustin Bowers: Got it. And then just in terms of DCTs, any way you can help us -- you can kind of frame the order of magnitude for that? Maybe just what percentage of subjects or trials or new bookings have some kind of DCT component?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, sure. I mentioned that was greater than 50% increase that we've seen. I'd say it's about a third of the new awards have some type of DCT component, if you look at the current quarter, and that's significantly more than it would have been a year ago. But if you look at the total trials that we do, it's still less than 10% of the total trials that have that type of component. So it just shows that as we move forward, having those skills and capabilities are obviously going to be more important. And that's why the acquisitions that we made last year, like GlobalCare and SnapIOT, were so important. We were able to get ahead of where we knew the market or believe the market was going to end up.\nJustin Bowers: Got it. Thanks so much.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Casey on for Tycho. Maybe just going back to COVID volume. So 3Q's average was 85,000 per day, peaking at 110,000 mid-September. Can you give us an idea of what you exited the quarter at and then where you are currently? Just want to understand sort of the step-down you're seeing here in the near term given infection rates. And then what is the high end and low end of your guide assumed for 4Q? And then maybe any kind of 2022 baseline framework that we can use for our models? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, sure. And just to give you a little bit additional history. So in the second quarter, we averaged 54,000 per day. And in the third quarter, we averaged 85,000 per day. But if you just look at the month of September, it was 114,000 that we were actually averaging in September. But as we went through September, we saw that number going down. And if you look at the first couple of weeks of October, we continue to see the number of COVID tests going down. If you look at our guidance, we think it will be somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 per day as we look at the fourth quarter and where we are currently, and I think that's a kind of pretty good range for you to work within.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then just one more on inflation costs. Your largest competitor last week talked about potentially passing some of those costs through to its customers via pricing. Do you have any sort of comments on potentially you guys doing the same? Or is it more about managing inflationary pressures through cost savings?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So I just believe that as an organization, you have to continually pressure your cost base, and you have to continually find ways to take out cost. In health care, and I've been involved in health care for 35 years, it's very hard to pass on price increases. And other certain areas within our business where we may be able to, of course, we'll look at that. And if there are opportunities, we would work on those opportunities. But I don't think that's something you should put in your base case. In your base case, I think it has to be how do you have cost reduction initiatives that continue to have the quality that you need, that continue to enable you to retain the people that you have, but also that you can do it more efficiently. So as we go forward, we're going to continue to really find ways to reduce our cost base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks, good morning. I just want to go back to that last question, Adam. You answered sort of for 2021 and maybe purposely didn't talk about 2022. But is there any baseline of a floor that you guys think about on COVID testing? You mentioned sort of that the lows this year, we're still -- or you guys are still doing 50,000 a day. I'd imagine the floor would be lower than that, but I'm not sure if you have some baseline or -- and sort of at-least figure per day? And then just what about reimbursement for next year as you think about sort of COVID and PHE? And then the second question more broadly, the managed care companies are talking a lot more about virtual first primary care offerings. As that sort of developed, how do you think that impacts you? And just give us a sense of your relationship with some of the tele health providers. Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, sure, Ralph. Good morning. So I'll start with the second question first. We have a great relationship with the vast majority of the tele health providers. And in fact, we work with them. And technologically, we have most of them where they can be directly working with us through their electronic medical records. So we embrace telemedicine. We think that it's good for health care where it makes sense. And we'll continue to work to ensure that as people get telemedicine, they can also get the appropriate diagnostic testing. And we have a team that is focused on ensuring that we have those relationships and that they work smoothly. With regard to COVID testing, I want to get through this year and see where we end up, and we will provide guidance next year, and it will be a range of potential. It really comes down to a couple of things. Will there be another variant that is not as manageable with the current vaccines? Will you need a different booster in the future? Will antibody testing become more important in order to know if and when people should get vaccines? So I don't want to give numbers for next year. I want to get through this year and see how it plays out. We gave a range, between 50,000 and 70,000 tests per day this year. I also want to see flu season because if you have a high flu season, I believe you'll probably see more COVID testing to the work that we do. Because if somebody is not sure if they have flu or COVID, I think they're going to want to come to us and get an answer as quickly as they can. And we have the at-home collection kit, but also physicians can prescribe a diagnostic test to look at both of those, and our turnaround time is very good. So let's see how this year plays out. Let's see what happens with the flu season. And then when we give guidance for next year, we'll give you an appropriate range.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Ralph, the one other thing, I guess, I would add, too, is that when you think about even the volatility that we experienced this year and the changing in our guidance as we went through, we really had kind of two variables. It's what was the demand going to be and what was the reimbursement going to be. And then obviously, as we kept to see the public health emergency continuing to expand, the pricing kind of just held out. So as we tighten the range, if you will, especially with the fourth quarter, as Adam said, we have a range of testing that we feel as best as we can. Here's a range that we think will happen but with an assumption that pricing will hold. As we think about '22, and again, we'll give you our best guess at that time, but I think it's fair to assume you're going to see a fairly wide range starting out the year because you go back to the uncertainty with regard to both volume and pricing. And again, we'll wait and see and update it, which is, again, to Adam's point earlier, that we'll continue to break out COVID testing separate from the Base Business so you can see the impact of both.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay, got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey. Good morning, guys. I just want to follow up, Glenn, I guess, to the point that you made earlier on the price mix being one of the key drivers of revenue, right? So on a normalized basis, maybe post '22, because obviously it's going to be noisy and COVID is in the background. But as I think about base, what's the right way to think about your longer-term view on revenue per req? And then I guess, as I look at your guidance here, you're showing the CAGR versus 2019 at 3.64% on the Base Business. Is that a good way to think about this, given broader utilization trends post 2022?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah. No, Brian, I'd say historically, we've always talked about that organic growth -- revenue growth for the Base Business would be, call it, in a 2% to 3% level with, call it, 1% to 2% coming from volume and then 1% from price/mix, which was mostly driven by mix because, as Adam said, assume that pricing, unit pricing, is overall relatively stable. So the view would be that long term, that's where we'll gravitate to. Obviously, we continue to add new innovative tests that could skew it hopefully upward. Obviously, we would add acquisitions to the mix that would skew it upwards. But just the organic Base Business trends, you would expect to see that. So it wasn't surprising that our revenues right now is still tracking at or slightly higher compared to '19 from a revenue standpoint, but we're seeing just an unusually high level of price mix than what we would normally expect to see, call it, in a normal environment.\nBrian Tanquilut: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is John on for Derik. I wanted to dig into the pricing for any surveillance pool testing as well as in terms of the volume. I feel like there is been some related announcements from schools in Florida and Texas looking to do some back-to-school surveillance testing. Any updates there?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. Good morning, John. I think that there are a lot of places that are doing surveillance testing. But typically, they're using the rapid test that you can kind of do on-site. We're not doing a lot of pool testing, although we have the ability to do it. And most of our testing is being done for people that either have symptoms, that have been exposed to COVID. It's much less of the surveillance. A lot of the surveillance work is being done by the other types of tests out there in the marketplace. So as we look to next year, we'll continue to make the service available. We do more of that through our Labcorp Employer Services group than we do through the core Labcorp Diagnostics business when it comes to surveillance. But of course, if there are opportunities out there, we are ready to help with those and serve in those, but it's not a significant amount of the testing that we do today.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. And then if I could just ask one more question. In terms of your esoteric testing, I wanted to ask how the oncology testing volume is trending and if you could provide any color on the uptake for the OmniSeq, the oncology test you launched.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So if you look at OmniSeq, we are seeing good uptake with that, although it's not a significant part of our testing overall at the moment. And if you look at oncology testing in general, it's recovered like the other esoteric tests recovered, and we feel that it's getting back to levels pre-pandemic.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Adam Schechter for any closing remarks.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you. So first of all, thanks to everybody for joining us today. And I hope you can see we're encouraged by our progress, and it led to another strong quarter, and it led us to increase our full year guidance again. More than 70,000 employees are going to continue to work relentlessly to achieve our mission to save and improve lives, but also continuing to help the world through the pandemic. So I'm grateful to my colleagues around the world for their dedication and focus. Lastly, if you've not yet been fully vaccinated and are eligible, please stay safe, please get vaccinated, and be careful as we approach the holiday season. Thanks, and we'll be in touch soon.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. At Labcorp, we continue to leverage innovation, science and technology to accelerate our strategy as we work to improve health and improve lives around the world. We serve as a trusted source of health information that helps customers advance health care and guide medical decisions. At the same time, we've remained focused on helping the world through the pandemic. In the third quarter, we delivered strong results. Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted EPS reached $6.82, and free cash flow was $650 million. As a result of our strong performance and our improved outlook, we're raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Glenn will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. The Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well with 10% and 22% growth, respectively. We saw consistent recovery across both businesses. In Diagnostics, we experienced broad geographic recovery in our Base Business and across our testing portfolio. Esoteric and routine testing demonstrated solid year-over-year growth for the quarter. The trailing 12 month net book-to-bill for Drug Development remains strong at 1.34. Drug Development continues to recover with nearly 85% of sites now open. The business also saw decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year. Now I'd like to turn to our ongoing role in the pandemic response. Labcorp continues to support the fight against the pandemic in every way possible through both our diagnostic and our drug development capabilities. We experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year. Time to results for COVID test remains an average of one to two days, with results typically available within one day. PCR testing volume averaged 85,000 per day in the quarter, up from 54,000 per day in the second quarter. We averaged 114,000 tests per day in September, with volumes declining week-over-week since that time. We will continue to break out COVID testing from Base Business revenue and volume as it remains difficult to forecast. We will also continue to maintain high capacity levels to be prepared for potential future scenarios. We also had another successful quarter of bringing new innovations to market. Notably, we recently received Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit. With flu season upon us, the kit offers a convenient way to test for both viruses. This new offering will be available for adults and children ages two and over and no upfront cost for those who meet clinical guidelines. In addition, we collaborated with AstraZeneca on both a COVID prevention and treatment trial of its new long-acting antibody combination. In the trial, the investigational antibody combination demonstrated statistically significant benefit in preventing symptomatic COVID and in reducing severe COVID or death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID, promising milestones in the development of new treatments. Also earlier this month, Merck filed for FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID in at-risk adults, a treatment that we supported through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. I'll now discuss progress on our strategy, and I'll start with oncology. The OmniSeq integration is going as planned, and their leading pan-cancer diagnostic capabilities extend our portfolio of solutions in this area. Additionally, we launched clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer. As part of our efforts to address healthy equity - health equity issues, we recently partnered with the Community Clinical Oncology Research Network to assess social and economic impacts of cancer care disparities. And we also recently began work with Pillar Biosciences to enhance our next-generation sequencing and plan to offer a specialty oncology assay. During the quarter, we advanced our commitment to intensifying our customer focus and embedding technology and data throughout our business. We acquired Ovia Health, a leading digital platform trusted by millions of women for family planning, pregnancy and parenting support. Ovia Health extends our position as a go-to source for women's health insights through our deep expertise in diagnostic, genetic and specialty testing. Additionally, we are working with several organizations to begin deploying Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant, which delivers comprehensive lab results and clinical insights directly to the point of care. We're also using technology to improve health for low-income individuals and families. We partnered with Medical Home Network to incorporate lab testing results into the records of Medicaid safety net patients. And lastly, through a collaboration with Medidata, we are utilizing digital biomarkers with drug, vaccine and device trials to enhance our decentralized clinical trialing offers. Pursuing opportunities with long-term, high-growth potential remains a focus. Our recent acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Myriad's Vectra test for rheumatoid arthritis and Ovia Health advance our position in key growth markets. We're making progress on our integrations, and we welcome new team members who joined Labcorp. Our M&A pipeline remains robust. We expect continued activity on this front for the balance of fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2022. Importantly, Labcorp continues to be recognized for the significant work we do. Just this month, we were named by Forbes as one of the world's best employers in 2021. In addition, Informa Pharma Intelligence selected Labcorp as a finalist for Best Contract Research Organization of the Year. These recognitions are only possible thanks to our diverse and talented workforce, which is at the core of our ability to innovate. Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the Board and management team's ongoing assessment of the company's structure and capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to ensuring Labcorp is best positioned to unlock shareholder value while offering patients and customers the support that they've come to expect. Working closely with our advisers, we have made significant progress on assessing both our capital allocation and our structure. And as previously shared, we expect to update you on our conclusions in this quarter. To summarize, our Base Business in both Diagnostics and Drug Development had a strong third quarter and is well-positioned for continued success. We remain dedicated to the fight against COVID, all while delivering on our strategy and carrying out our mission. I'm excited by the progress we've made and for what lies ahead. With that, Glenn will take you through the details of our third quarter results. Good morning, Ann. Sure. Good morning. Ann, again, we're not, as you said, providing guidance for 2022, but as I look at 2022, I think there are things that you've seen this quarter that you can kind of start to think about 2022. First of all, the Base Business for both Drug Development and Diagnostics is rebounding well. And if you look even for the first couple of weeks of October, that rebounded from where we were even in September. So we would expect the Base Business to continue to improve. At the same time, we've said before, we actually have several things that we're looking at when it comes to cost. One is we kept our headcount at a level that is higher than we typically would to ensure that we're prepared for whatever scenario could occur with COVID. And by the way, I'm glad we did that. If you would have gone back to the second quarter where we averaged 55,000 PCR tests, there was good reason to say we should reduce headcount because we saw tests going down. We didn't do that. And then when the tests came to 110,000 or so per day in the month of September, we still had a one day turnaround time for the majority of tests. So we're going to continue to keep our labor costs a bit higher based upon number of people to ensure that we're prepared for any scenario. And that's for both Diagnostics and Drug Development. I said Drug Development continues to rebound. 85% of sites are now open, but that still means 15% of sites are not open. We're continuing to keep that headcount because these people are hard to retain, they're hard to train, and we believe the business will come back. Separate and distinct from that, we are seeing impacts in certain materials and people-related costs, and we're seeing that through the supply chain constraints but also a very tight labor market. I don't think it's any different than what our peers are seeing. Everybody is seeing the same thing. So we're focused on maintaining our operational continuity, and we're going to continue to look for ways to reduce expenses. Now the increased material costs and increased labor costs, if you - very quickly, it takes us time to take out the expenses, but we're going to continue to find ways, to find efficiencies and reduce costs wherever we can to offset those things. I think the biggest factor, again, going to 2022 is what happens with COVID and COVID testing. And when we provide guidance, we're going to break out the guidance for COVID testing like we did this year so that we can give you a range of possibilities, and then we'll also give you what we believe the range of opportunities would be for the Base Business. And then the last thing I would say is we also are working on our capital allocation and that we are doing - continuing to do M&A, and we have a significant pipeline as we go into next year. I'm very excited about the pipeline of M&A that we have, and we'll continue to do share repos where appropriate. So hopefully, that gives you some kind of context of how we're thinking about next year. I think that we have good momentum as we go into the year. Sure. Good morning, Jack. Yeah. So let me give you some additional context. And I appreciate the question, Jack. So first of all, I want to start off by saying that we believe that there is intrinsic value in Labcorp that's yet to be realized, we believe that. And we're working closely with our outside advisers, and we have several of them. And we're also working with our Board of Directors to evaluate our structure and capital allocation as you know. We are making significant progress to ensure that we find a way to best position Labcorp on lap  the shareholder value. I can tell you, Jack, we are performing a very thorough and a very thoughtful analysis. And it just takes time to fully assess all of the alternatives, and we continue to assess all of the alternatives. Though we're not giving any additional updates today, we are looking forward to share the conclusions once the review is complete, and we still expect that to happen in this quarter. We haven't - I want to reach the conclusions, and then we'll figure out exactly how we communicate it on a very broad, direct basis. So as we reach the conclusions, then we'll think about how to best broadly communicate our decisions. Yeah. I'll give you some context, and then I'll ask Glenn to provide additional context. So we still have a strong book-to-bill, it was 1.34, and we've always said that a 1.2 or above gets you high single - mid to high single digit growth. So anything above a 1.2, we think, is a very strong book-to-bill. And I've said time and time again, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter. I look at the trailing 12 months because it gives you a better understanding over time. And with book-to-bill, it could be lumpy. So you could fall in one quarter this year and fall out into a different quarter versus next year. So the quarterly, we try to watch carefully, obviously, but I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from one quarter versus another. What I look at is the RFPs, which continue to be very strong, and we continue to do very well as we go through the RFPs. So if you look at the trailing 12 month net orders, they were $7.8 billion. They were up 27% year-over-year. And if you look at the backlog, it was $14.4 billion. That increased by over $100 million in the second quarter, and that was up 15% year-over-year. So I think there's still strength there that you can see. But again, I focus on the trailing 12 month and I think above 1.2 is where you want to be. I don't know, Glenn, if you want to talk about some of the quarter fluctuations. Yeah. Sure, Kevin. Good morning. First of all, we remain excited, as you said, about the pipeline that we have. And we continue to see the ability to acquire hospital, local, regional laboratories, and that kind of makes a lot of sense. They're accretive in the first year, typically. They return their cost of capital very quickly, and we know how to integrate those, and we see significant potential for that as we go through this year into next year. I've said before, those sometimes take longer than I would expect, but the good news is that we continue to have a very strong pipeline. And I'm confident that we're going to have some really interesting things that we can do with regard to those types of acquisitions. Then we look for strategic acquisitions, and those can be something like Ovia, where it's a digital platform that enhances our capabilities in technology and digitalization, but it's also in a very important high growth market where we have a very strong share in women's health. And then you look at things that we've done before, like SnapIOT or GlobalCare, where it gives us strategic capabilities in drug development. I mentioned that the decentralized clinical trials that we're doing were 50% higher year-over-year, and we're going to need more capabilities and more technology in areas like that. So I kind of separate it into three buckets. The diagnostic laboratory acquisition opportunities, then the strategic opportunities for both diagnostics and for drug development, and we've got multiple different things that we're looking at in each of those areas. Yeah. I think their environments are tough. I also think that with COVID, they've realized they had to update a lot of their machinery in order to do the COVID testing if they want to do it in a hospital. They had to take a look at how they were using their capital. And they realized that running their laboratory might not be core to what they do every day, and they probably would do better if they had another surgical operating suite or put their money towards something like that versus updating laboratory equipment. So as we have more and more discussions with the hospitals and hospital systems and local laboratories, I think the realization is that diagnostics does take capital, in order to have the right machinery, you have to run that machinery often to get the best output and margins through running that type of equipment; and that we can do it extraordinarily well for them. So I think all 3 of those things have led to us having a more robust pipeline now than what I've seen in the past. Yeah. So we're continuing to execute on our strategy today, and we're doing a very thorough and thoughtful strategic review. We're making sure that, of course, we consider both as we move forward, but it's not getting in the way of us doing what we need to do to run our business and be successful, execute in the marketplace today. And hopefully, what you see when you look at our numbers is that we're executing extraordinarily well in both Diagnostics and Drug Development. And we're continuing to do M&A as we showed with what we bought from Myriad for the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Ovia, OmniSeq. But at the same time, we're making progress on the strategic review. Yeah. Thank you, Ricky. Good morning. So first of all, as baseline, I tend to look at 2019 and go pre-pandemic. And then I look at what the growth would have been if everything was normalized. And that's kind of just how I think about how to grow the Base Business as we move into the future. I'd be very careful comparing versus 2020 or 2021 because the Base Business was recovering, the COVID testing was different. For example, as we saw COVID testing grow significantly in September, we saw an impact on the Base Business in September. It was slightly less than August. Now we see COVID tested less for the first couple of weeks of October. We've seen the Base Business now nearly flat to where it was in 2019. So using 2020, 2021, I'd say you have to be really thoughtful and careful with that. I use 2019 as the baseline to figure out where we should kind of get from a normalized perspective as we look at next year. And then with regard to long-term guidance, we're looking at everything as we go through the strategic review, and we're discussing all options for structure as well as capital allocation and how we communicate those things. So we haven't reached a conclusion on that, Ricky, but I can tell you, we are considering all of it. Sure. Good morning, Justin. The first thing I'd say is that's important because as you think about last year, we had a significant amount, between 10% and 15%, that we discussed of the book-to-bill on COVID. And a lot of those studies were in third and fourth quarter of last year, and they happened very quickly because everybody was working as fast as they could to enroll those trials, get the results of the trials so that we can get the vaccines and the therapeutics to market as fast. So you're burning through those studies faster than you typically would. If you look at where we currently are, the mix is much less COVID right now. It's less than 5%, frankly, of the total that we have for the backlog. So it's significantly less than it was before. We are still doing some work. But again, as you start to think about future comparisons, you just have to remember, third and fourth quarter of last year had significant COVID studies in them. Yes, sure. I mentioned that was greater than 50% increase that we've seen. I'd say it's about a third of the new awards have some type of DCT component, if you look at the current quarter, and that's significantly more than it would have been a year ago. But if you look at the total trials that we do, it's still less than 10% of the total trials that have that type of component. So it just shows that as we move forward, having those skills and capabilities are obviously going to be more important. And that's why the acquisitions that we made last year, like GlobalCare and SnapIOT, were so important. We were able to get ahead of where we knew the market or believe the market was going to end up. Thank you. Yeah, sure. And just to give you a little bit additional history. So in the second quarter, we averaged 54,000 per day. And in the third quarter, we averaged 85,000 per day. But if you just look at the month of September, it was 114,000 that we were actually averaging in September. But as we went through September, we saw that number going down. And if you look at the first couple of weeks of October, we continue to see the number of COVID tests going down. If you look at our guidance, we think it will be somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 per day as we look at the fourth quarter and where we are currently, and I think that's a kind of pretty good range for you to work within.\nQ \u2013Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then just one more on inflation costs. Your largest competitor last week talked about potentially passing some of those costs through to its customers via pricing. Do you have any sort of comments on potentially you guys doing the same? Or is it more about managing inflationary pressures through cost savings? Yeah. So I just believe that as an organization, you have to continually pressure your cost base, and you have to continually find ways to take out cost. In health care, and I've been involved in health care for 35 years, it's very hard to pass on price increases. And other certain areas within our business where we may be able to, of course, we'll look at that. And if there are opportunities, we would work on those opportunities. But I don't think that's something you should put in your base case. In your base case, I think it has to be how do you have cost reduction initiatives that continue to have the quality that you need, that continue to enable you to retain the people that you have, but also that you can do it more efficiently. So as we go forward, we're going to continue to really find ways to reduce our cost base. Yeah, sure, Ralph. Good morning. So I'll start with the second question first. We have a great relationship with the vast majority of the tele health providers. And in fact, we work with them. And technologically, we have most of them where they can be directly working with us through their electronic medical records. So we embrace telemedicine. We think that it's good for health care where it makes sense. And we'll continue to work to ensure that as people get telemedicine, they can also get the appropriate diagnostic testing. And we have a team that is focused on ensuring that we have those relationships and that they work smoothly. With regard to COVID testing, I want to get through this year and see where we end up, and we will provide guidance next year, and it will be a range of potential. It really comes down to a couple of things. Will there be another variant that is not as manageable with the current vaccines? Will you need a different booster in the future? Will antibody testing become more important in order to know if and when people should get vaccines? So I don't want to give numbers for next year. I want to get through this year and see how it plays out. We gave a range, between 50,000 and 70,000 tests per day this year. I also want to see flu season because if you have a high flu season, I believe you'll probably see more COVID testing to the work that we do. Because if somebody is not sure if they have flu or COVID, I think they're going to want to come to us and get an answer as quickly as they can. And we have the at-home collection kit, but also physicians can prescribe a diagnostic test to look at both of those, and our turnaround time is very good. So let's see how this year plays out. Let's see what happens with the flu season. And then when we give guidance for next year, we'll give you an appropriate range. Yeah. Good morning, John. I think that there are a lot of places that are doing surveillance testing. But typically, they're using the rapid test that you can kind of do on-site. We're not doing a lot of pool testing, although we have the ability to do it. And most of our testing is being done for people that either have symptoms, that have been exposed to COVID. It's much less of the surveillance. A lot of the surveillance work is being done by the other types of tests out there in the marketplace. So as we look to next year, we'll continue to make the service available. We do more of that through our Labcorp Employer Services group than we do through the core Labcorp Diagnostics business when it comes to surveillance. But of course, if there are opportunities out there, we are ready to help with those and serve in those, but it's not a significant amount of the testing that we do today. Yeah. So if you look at OmniSeq, we are seeing good uptake with that, although it's not a significant part of our testing overall at the moment. And if you look at oncology testing in general, it's recovered like the other esoteric tests recovered, and we feel that it's getting back to levels pre-pandemic. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So first of all, thanks to everybody for joining us today. And I hope you can see we're encouraged by our progress, and it led to another strong quarter, and it led us to increase our full year guidance again. More than 70,000 employees are going to continue to work relentlessly to achieve our mission to save and improve lives, but also continuing to help the world through the pandemic. So I'm grateful to my colleagues around the world for their dedication and focus. Lastly, if you've not yet been fully vaccinated and are eligible, please stay safe, please get vaccinated, and be careful as we approach the holiday season. Thanks, and we'll be in touch soon."

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year due to organic growth of 3.4%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 50 basis points. The 3.4% increase in organic revenue is driven by a 10.2% increase in the company's organic Base business partially offset by a 6.8% decrease in COVID testing. Operating income for the quarter was $767 million or 18.9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $92 million of amortization and $48 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $907 million or 22.3% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 29.7% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased Base Business demand and a tight labor market as the company continues to invest in its workforce. Partially offsetting these headwinds were the benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.4% compared to 25.7% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. Net earnings for the quarter were $587 million or $6.05 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.82 in the quarter, down from $8.41 last year. Operating cash flow was $767 million in the quarter compared to $786 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million or 2.9% of revenue compared to $77 million or 2% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $650 million in the quarter compared to $709 million last year. During the quarter, we used $300 million of our cash flow for our share repurchase program and invested $292 million on acquisitions. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 3.2% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 3.9%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 30 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 9.7% reduction from COVID testing partially offset by a 5.8% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.7%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume increased 0.2% over last year as acquisition volume contributed 0.2% and organic volume decreased by 0.1%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 5.9% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.9% increase in the Base Business. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.1% to our organic Base Business volume growth. Price mix decreased 3.4% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 3.8% partially offset by currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Diagnostics organic Base Business revenue growth was 9% compared to its Base Business last year, with 7.7% coming from volume and 1.3% coming from price mix, which was primarily due to an increase in test per session. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $775 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1 billion or 37.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction of COVID testing and higher personnel costs partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, Base Business margins were down slightly due to the negative impact from PAMA. Diagnostics 3 year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of this year. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 17.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 19.9%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. This was partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its central lab business of 3.5% and divestitures of 0.3%. Drug Development's Base Business benefited from broad-based growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic work. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 11.4% primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $226 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $210 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings partially offset by lower COVID testing and higher personnel costs. The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to lower COVID testing. Excluding the impact from COVID testing, operating margins would have been up compared to last year. For comparability to peers, Drug Development earnings exclude $36 million of expense related to the enterprise component of its bonus, which is included in unallocated corporate expense. We expect full year margins to be up over 2020, which were up over 2019. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.8 billion and 1.34, respectively. During the quarter, orders were negatively impacted by approximately $150 million due to a significant scope change, which decreased the book-to-bill. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.4 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to last year. We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2021, for the remainder of the year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong third quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14% from prior guidance of 6.5% to 9%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 18.5% to 19.5%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 11% to down 6%. We are raising our expectations for revenue to grow in Diagnostics by 8% to 10% from prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 2%. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 16% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is expected to be down 11% to down 6%. We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 19.5% to 20.5% from prior guidance of 17% to 19%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 170 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 21.5% to 22.5%. Given the improved top line growth expectations, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $26 to $28, up from prior guidance of $21.5 to $25. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion. For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 third quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results. In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic, while also growing our Base Business. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the remainder of the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. And Jack, in our remarks, we talked about this change in scope that we had that was $150 million that obviously negatively impacted the quarter. So as Adam said, when you put it in the perspective of the trailing 12 months, it gets kind of rounded out, if you will. We still have strong levels of backlog, strong levels of orders. To your point, while our orders on a trailing 12 would have been up around 27% year-on-year, including the scope change for the quarter, we would have been down slightly, down around 4%. However, what's interesting is that we actually received the order in the third quarter of a year ago. So it really has kind of a double effect. If you back it out of the year that we received it, the third quarter, and you take it out of now the change from the third quarter of this, would actually would have been up around 13% in orders, excluding it for the quarter. So it still reinforces, frankly, from our perspective, why we really focus on the trailing 12 because even with the volatility, you really get a sense of the true growth and the future potential of the business. Yes. Ricky, it's Glenn. As we've seen even currently, so you can use it as a run rate or you can look at it for the full year, both businesses' top line revenues are kind of at the high end of historical levels compared to '19. So we really feel good about the current levels of performance. What's interesting and unique, and I think a little bit to your question within the Diagnostics business, is that we're keeping our revenues at the same level of growth compared to '19, but we're doing it through price/mix because effectively, our volume levels have been plus or minus relatively flat to '19. So as we go forward, obviously, we would expect volume to continue to tick up and go above '19 levels but obviously, see a corresponding decline, if you will, in tests or price mix, which has been driven by tests per session that have been higher than normal given people have had fewer visits. But overall, to Adam's comment, as we look to pre-pandemic levels, both businesses are kind of tracking well to it, albeit, you can argue, the mix of how we're getting there is a little bit different. Ralph, the one other thing, I guess, I would add, too, is that when you think about even the volatility that we experienced this year and the changing in our guidance as we went through, we really had kind of two variables. It's what was the demand going to be and what was the reimbursement going to be. And then obviously, as we kept to see the public health emergency continuing to expand, the pricing kind of just held out. So as we tighten the range, if you will, especially with the fourth quarter, as Adam said, we have a range of testing that we feel as best as we can. Here's a range that we think will happen but with an assumption that pricing will hold. As we think about '22, and again, we'll give you our best guess at that time, but I think it's fair to assume you're going to see a fairly wide range starting out the year because you go back to the uncertainty with regard to both volume and pricing. And again, we'll wait and see and update it, which is, again, to Adam's point earlier, that we'll continue to break out COVID testing separate from the Base Business so you can see the impact of both. Yeah. No, Brian, I'd say historically, we've always talked about that organic growth -- revenue growth for the Base Business would be, call it, in a 2% to 3% level with, call it, 1% to 2% coming from volume and then 1% from price/mix, which was mostly driven by mix because, as Adam said, assume that pricing, unit pricing, is overall relatively stable. So the view would be that long term, that's where we'll gravitate to. Obviously, we continue to add new innovative tests that could skew it hopefully upward. Obviously, we would add acquisitions to the mix that would skew it upwards. But just the organic Base Business trends, you would expect to see that. So it wasn't surprising that our revenues right now is still tracking at or slightly higher compared to '19 from a revenue standpoint, but we're seeing just an unusually high level of price mix than what we would normally expect to see, call it, in a normal environment."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Labcorp Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Chas Cook, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's second quarter 2021 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. We remain committed to using extensive diagnostics and drug development capabilities to advance our mission of improving health and improve lives around the world. Innovation, technology and science remains at the forefront and will always do to patients, providers and shareholders. To that end, the second quarter of 2021 was very strong across both diagnostics and drug development. Revenue totalled $3.8 billion a 39% increase from the same period in 2020. Most of this growth was driven by the continued strength in our base businesses. Adjusted EPS reached $6.13 versus $2.50 from the prior year. Free cash flow was $390 million in the quarter versus $272 million in 2020. The strong performance in the quarter and the improved outlook for the year result in us meeting full year guidance for revenue, EPS and cash flow. Glenn will review the new guidance with you in a moment. Our base business continues to recover and were 51% and 32% for diagnostics and drug development respectively. The drug development trailing 12 month book-to-bill remained strong at 1.41. This performance was patients and provider returning to routine healthcare checkups and pharmaceutical clients resuming their important research activities at an even faster pace than expected.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I am going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full-year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion an increase of 38.7% over last year due to organic growth of 35.5%, acquisitions of 1.2% and favourable foreign currency translation of 200 basis points. Our organic base business increased 42.4% when compared to our base business last year, while COVID testing revenues of $444 million were flat with last year.\nOperator:  Our first Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a strong quarter. I guess my question will be a Covance. Obviously you're seeing some good strength there and strong. Just wanted to hear your thoughts and how do you think about sustainability of margins and growth outlook on your ability to maintain that high pace of growth going forward just for the Covance business?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Hi Brian. Thanks very much for the question. So Covance had a very strong quarter and if you look at our Labcorp drug development business in total, we had progress in all parts of the drug development business all three grew strong into double-digits and as I look at the margins going forward, I've always said be careful to look at any one quarter of the margin especially as were going through COVID. There are certain areas where we continue to maintain people and when we maintain those people, were doing it because we're going through COVID and we know we're going to need them for after COVID. So some of our margins look a little bit odd from quarter to quarter. We're also seeing a slight increase in the material cost and labor cost which people are seeing in almost every industry, but we're going to continues to offset that with things like our launchpad initiatives. So I'd look at the margin on a yearly basis and we believe that this year will be better than last year which was better than the year before and I would expect as we go into next year in our drug development business, the margins will look better than this year. So we're going to continue to find ways to expand our margins moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan: Wanted to focus on capital allocation, was curious if you think is the strategic review having any influence over the timing of how you redeploy capital? You have $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, net leverage of return is below the three turns you've been at historically. Within the second half acceleration just any additional color on the pacing of or magnitude of what you're looking to redeploy?\nAdam Schechter: Hi Jack and I'll ask Glenn to jump in. So first of all two separate thoughts. One is we continue to execute on our strategy and we continue to do our capital allocation and we've always said, our allocation is focused on strategic acquisitions. You saw one of those where we purchased the remaining interest in Omni this quarter. So oncology is a strategic area. We're looking for ways to enhance our strategic capabilities. And then we said we're going to look to do more hospital resolve, local laboratory acquisitions and you saw one of those this quarter, with what we announced we were doing with one of the hospitals in Minneapolis area, Minnesota. So those are the types of f acquisitions we're going to continue to do. What I would say is the pipeline is as robust as I've ever seen it and frankly I thought we would have couple more close this quarter, but I feel confident we'll close more of those as we go through this year. Separately distinct from that, we continue to make progress on the strategic review and we're going to do this strategic review once we reach the conclusions, we'll look forward to sharing those with you and we expect to do that in the fourth quarter of this year. Glenn?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Jack, the only thing I'd add is you're right, our targeted leverage, has been the 2.5 to 3 times and a couple of things are going, obviously we have the benefit of the COVID testing, which has generated and helped our free cash flow this year, which has helped improved it. But also when you look at the improvement in our EBITDA, because of COVID testing, it's higher than normal. So as you do look at our leverage relative to call it pre pandemic, you using a profile on the 2019, you'd get that are leveraged. Currently gross debt to EBITDA is towards the upper end of our range. Having said that as Adam commented on, we expect to use our free cash flow this year for M&A and share repurchases. The midpoint of our range a little bit over $2 billion. We spent around $400 million so far in the first half of the year. So the Alyssa say it implies that the second half you'll see more capital allocation given to both share repurchases and M&A and spoke to the strength of our M&A pipeline, which again, gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to deploy more towards M&A than we've done in the first half, but we'll continue to use our share repurchase program as well.\nJack Meehan: Great. Looking forward to the updates. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. I want to talk a little bit about Covance, revenues were up sequentially yet the margins fell by about 150 basis points sequentially, is there any seasonality there? Is there anything related to COVID potentially that would cause that I guess really ultimately what I'm trying to figure out is what is the right way to think about margins for that business going forward?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Kevin, yeah, Adam actually commented a little bit in the remarks also that looking quarter to quarter, obviously, you do have issues on seasonality and just timing related things in that the comparison year over year, it gives you a pretty strong view of how our margins are doing, which again, in both businesses from a base business standpoint are up nicely. When you look at Covance though to your point, sequentially, you move from kind of the first quarter to the second margins were down principally, related to COVID testing was down within that segment. The level of COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies was down compared to the first quarter. We had higher pass-throughs in the second quarter versus the first and obviously the tight labor market also impacting it. So a lot of things that will impact a quarter to quarter kind of change. What we commented on is that the second half margins within drug development, we expect to be higher than the first half and that for the full year, we expect it to be up over the prior year. So we feel good about how the business is leveraging the top line growth from the base business standpoint.\nKevin Caliendo: And just quick follow up to that. How much is wage pressure impacting both segments of the business. And do you expect that, how are you contemplating that within the guidance or how impactful has that been to your guidance so far?\nGlenn Eisenberg: So of course we look at that closely. We've included what we think are the range of potential things that could occur within the guidance that we provided today. I think everybody's facing a tough labor market in most industries as we speak. And we're just going to have to continue to find ways through launchpad and other ways to reduce costs to cover that in the future. So we'll continue to find ways to take out costs in other areas, through things like virtual clinical trials and those types of things.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is not open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. So a couple of questions here. First of all, when we think about the comparison for the base business for core testing versus 2019, I think you said it's up in the second quarter was up 4.5% versus 2Q baseline, can you maybe give us a little bit more details on how it progressed on a monthly basis and what are you seeing in the July run rate and what's embedded into second half guidance? And then secondly and you talked about the increase in labor costs and often with launchpad, any updates on what's going to affect launchpad. I think launchpad ends in 2021. What are kind of like your plans for the next round of cost savings?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah. So let me start Ricky with the base business. So, the diagnostics we saw the base business rebound nicely. And one thing is to look at revenue, which is what you stated, but the other thing is to look at volume. And for the first time, since the pandemic, we saw the volume increase in June of this year compared to June of 2019. So that's a good sign and it shows, continued recovery. As we look at July, it's still too early to give any sense of that. But our expectation throughout this year is that we will see continued volume and revenue growth versus 2019 and that will continue throughout this year.\nAdam Schechter: And Ricky maybe just a couple of follow-on comments because as Adam said, we crossed over where our revenue and diagnostic base business really in the fourth quarter of last year was favorable to 2019 levels, but that was driven off of the price mix know we were seeing more tests per session that was making up for the volume shortfall. So June was a signal a month for us, if you will, as we now have crossed over with volume now comparing favorably as well as price mix continues to be higher than normal, but as we continue to progress through the rest of this year and obviously going forward, we expect those to fall more in line with kind of the historical patterns. As your comment on launchpad and really with the tight labor market in particular, but both businesses have launchpad initiatives. We completed drug development one at least publicly last year and this year we'll wrap up our diagnostics business, but that's part of an ongoing business process improvement initiative of the company every single year. We know we have just high inflationary costs as we go into every year and launchpad is really set to offset mitigate those rising costs. So continue to see a lot of opportunities to continue to drive productivity through technology, through the labor efficiency that will continue to help mitigate those costs going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Certainly understand the fluidity of the backdrop, that the guidance is pretty wide for having seen the first half. I guess why keep it so wide and maybe help on assumptions particularly on the lower end that that seemed pretty hard to get to. And then just quickly also wanted to ask about it. I think you mentioned the number of average COVID tests per day in the second quarter was 54,000 is hoping you can give us, where the midpoint of guidance assumes for the back half around that. And if any color you can give on what you've seen over the last couple of weeks in terms of average tests per day on COVID thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, I'll start with the test question and we can give you some context on the ranges. As we said, the average number of tests per day in the second quarter is 54,000. And if you look at the month of June, it actually was lower than the average of the 54,000. If you would've just trended based upon the June data, you would have been in the 35% to 50% reduction that we had been quoting for the beginning of the year in terms of tasks. But we saw a slight change with the Delta variant and we also saw the extension of the government saying that we're going to continue to be in an emergency situation. And those two things gave us confidence that the reduction in COVID test would be less than what we have originally had in the plan. And that's why we lowered and narrowed the guidance for COVID testing to 33% down to 38% down. So, we really did narrow that and provide some additional guidance there. If you look at those numbers, I know it's still a fairly wide range. It's gone from 33% to 38%, but there's a lot of different ways that you can actually get there. One is by number of tests. And if you start to think about the variant and what we're saying, will that continue. If you start to think about what could happen, if there's a strong flu season or mass or mandated again, in certain states, maybe the flu season will be very light like it was last year, and then the other is obviously price. And the question is, will there continue to be an emergency declaration as we go into the fourth quarter of this year? So what we've tried to do is kind of triangulate in all those different variables, and that's why we give you the range of 33% to 38%, which I think is a good reasonable range for us to be in with the uncertainties that still exist.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Ralph, the only thing, I guess I would add to that is that what ranges are, we don't disagree this year or kind of wider than they would be in a normal year and just reflects the lack of visibility and the uncertainty that's ahead of us. Having said that with the new guidance that we provided, we've not only narrowed the ranges. So we've trumped the range given that we have six months remaining, we give annual guidance and more importantly, we've increased the call it the midpoints of all the key financial metrics that we guide to. So reflecting the company's performance. So when you look at the midpoint of a range, as you would expect, that's kind of where we see things if we were to have to kind of put in a point, but we then give the ranges around it because there was a lot of things that on the positive or the negative side that could occur overall. And as Adam said, with regards specifically to the COVID testing again, narrowing the range and improving it. But what we did see, which was the first time, which we didn't have when we gave our guidance last quarter, was that we've seen a sequential decline in COVID testing each month as we've gone through the year, as Adam said with June being the lower than the average for the quarter. For July was the first month, frankly, that we've seen the level of COVID testing higher than the prior month. And so obviously with the advent of the Delta virus the advent of the extension of the public health emergency gives us reason to feel now better about where we are with COVID testing for this year, then we did just have a quarter ago, but still with a lot of uncertainty that's ahead of us.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nJustin Bowers: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Justin Bowers on from Pito. Just shifting back to the diagnostics, the diagnostics business how should we think about 3Q versus 4Q and the base business? It sounds like you're back to at or above pre COVID volumes, but the question really is, should we -- does the guide kind of assume like normal kind of historic seasonality patterns or something different? And I'm asking because we're just hearing diversion messaging from hospitals and med tech companies. So trying to figure out where you guys stand on that.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. No, I think from our standpoint and why we kind of focus on the 2019 comparison, just to kind of get the back to the more normalcy, if you will. We're still obviously seeing a strong recovery as we compare to 2020, but similarly, when we look at a comp relative to 2020 last year, we saw the trough really being early in the year with the pandemic, and then it got better throughout the year, but we continue to expect to see good growth and favorable margins year on year compared to '20. So really taking a look back to '19 and to your point, diagnostics does definitely has seasonality to the business. So when you look at sequentially, you really have to look at holidays and where the days lay. So we do expect normal seasonal patterns to occur within diagnostics. Again, especially when you look at it relative to '19 more normal times. So from a call it a margin standpoint while we expect margins to be up year on year, we expect them to be flat to slightly down compared to 2019 because of the negative impact of Pama. As far as just the revenue growth we feel good that the volume, again, revenues have been up even compared to '19, but we're seeing the volumes pick up. So volumes will be positive which will be a continued trend, racing mixed should start to come down from where it's been again, as volumes pick up to get back to that more normal patterns, but again, good growth expectations for the second half of this year from volume and from favorable next. And obviously as we go into '22, expect that to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is not open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. A couple followups on the COVID outlook specifically, are you able to quantify where you ended that July on tests per day? I'm just curious what that step up, looks like, and then does the outlook bacon any back to school testing, I'm curious if you're starting to have discussions around bigger programs? And then lastly, I'm just curious on serology, latest thinking there, obviously a lot more discussion lately on anybody's potentially wearing off. And how are you thinking about it enough to consider in the back half of the year? Yeah,\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think they're all important questions as we go through the rest of this year to next year. I'll start with the serology first. At the moment we have the ability to do as many serology tests as we would need to do. The CDC has not come out to recommend utilization of serology to try to understand titers. So therefore not many people are going for serology test so that we can do several thousands every day, but we're prepared to do as many as we may need, but we're also developing and have the ability to do T cell memory testing as well as semi quantitative testing, which ultimately might be helpful if you start to think about a tighter, that you might need to understand the weighting of effectiveness of vaccines over time. So what I would say is we are prepared for whatever might be necessary and we're building capacity to be ready for whatever that could be. My personal point of view is that I believe that serology testing over time will be more important, particularly if vaccination is not going to be every single year, if it could be less or more than a year and if it could be different by individuals, then I think you're going to need significant serology testing and that's why we continue to develop it. With regard to back to school, we're having a lot of discussions about back to school. We're prepared to do as PCR testing, as we may need for back to school, whether it be through individual tests or through pooling. But to be honest, they've really been discussions. We haven't seen a lot of schools willing to pull the trigger and say, we're going to put in a significant back to school testing program. So we're going to have to wait and see and even though we're having a lot of discussions within the range that we've provided up to down 33% to down 38%, there's multiple different ways you can get there. One would be a lot of back to school testing, but a lower price. Other ways it'd be not much back the school testing, but you could continue to have growth in other areas. And then the last thing I would say is, it's truly to give the end of July, but as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, we're certainly starting to see numbers that are not yet there, but closer to the average that we had the last quarter versus where we ended for the month of June.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. that's helpful. And then maybe one follow up just on a broader kind of decentralization theme. Obviously just spent a lot of capital place over the past year and in hospitals and smaller labs and physician offices, can you maybe just talk on the competitive dynamics whether you see that as a potential longer-term risk as they have to fall back on that COVID testing and think about broader flow through?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, again, if you look at COVID testing or molecular tests, and if you look at the number of molecular tests that we do as a percent of the total 530 million or so tests that we perform every year, it's still a very, very small amount. So even though there might be additional capacity in hospitals or laboratories for molecular types tests, it wouldn't have a significant impact on our overall business, frankly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is not open. Hi, good morning\nDerik De Bruin: So I know that and I know it's, tough enough to predict the second half of '20 let alone, sorry. of '21 let alone the looking at '22, but I just was wondering if the sort of your initial thoughts on sort of where the consensus estimates are. If I look at earnings estimates and you just words who have grown EPS by 10% off of your 2019 base, that gives you something around a $15 number for '22 and earnings the streets around $16, assuming some COVID and some other things like that. Is that, are you comfortable with sort of like where the consensus estimates are right now and just some, any sort of initial color on what you sort of think about the '22 at this point? Yeah.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So the first thing I'd say there is that we're still working through 2021. We're obviously not providing guidance today for 2022, but the reason we're trying to break out our base business versus our covert testing is to really give you a better sense of how to start to think about 2021. And if you take up a base business, we expect to get back to normal growth rates that you would have seen prior to the pandemic. The part that we're still trying to figure out is what could COVID testing look like as we go to 2021? And that's the entire reason that we're giving you the different pieces to try to help think about it as we get there next year.\nDerik De Bruin: Great. And if I can ask one follow up can you talk a little bit more about your oncology testing going on with that? Is that back as well? I know you talked about routine, testing me back as oncology back response. So we're hearing some mixed things in the market about demand is, and these are some of the, some of the other companies.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, what I would say is if you look at esoteric testing, which includes ecology that actually went down less than the other testing that we do more routine testing at the beginning of the pandemic. But as we stand here today, they both come back and, it looks about what you would expect. It's about a 60% to 40% breakout of our business, 60% on a more standard testing in revenue and about 40% on the esoteric, including oncology. So we see them both coming back. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMatt Larew: Hi, good morning. You mentioned the test book session again, were a driver, but curious how that trended sequentially, because you mentioned that as a driver in Q1 as well, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for whether things are normalizing or whether, if there's still some catch-up going on as patients, visit physicians, touch it for the first time.\nAdam Schechter: I'll let Glenn give some specific, but in general, we expect a test for a session to come back to pre COVID levels over time, and we're already starting to see that a bit. But Glenn maybe you can give some additional context.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, no, it's exactly right. Sequentially the test per session impact was less than it was in the first quarter, but obviously the volume levels were much higher in the second quarter then than the first quarter as well. So you will ultimately get back to that more sense of normalcy over time.\nMatt Larew: Okay. Now just on pixel, you've given some good data points here over the last couple of quarters on access and how that's improved. But can you share any data around what the patient uptake either volume or ever to contribution has looked like? And then maybe what the margin profile of pixel would look like relative to your traditional business?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So if you look at pixel it ranges anywhere from 4% to maybe 8% at the peak of the percent of total PCR tests that we do. So it's a part of the armor where they have people that use it really appreciate it. It's now available in 6,000 Walgreens stores and things like Jordache and Instacart but it's been relatively consistent at about 4% or so of the total tests that we do and the margin isn't that different than other margins.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Wright with Credit Swiss. Your line is now open.\nAaron Wright: Great. Thanks. What are you seeing in terms of the industry fundamentals across the Covance clinical business in terms of site accessibility, RFP flow, and in the nature of new business wins in the quarter, what was still COVID related work and you did mention the labor cost at Covance, and I'm curious if, if you anticipate seeing any partial offset from some of the disruption associated with some of the consolidation across your peers in this space and curious if that's something that's coming up with customers as well. Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. I'll give you some additional context the business. The first thing I would say is about 80% of sites are currently open. So we still have sites around the world that have not yet fully open to allow us to go into help them enroll patients. But, we would expect continued improvement there as we go through the year. I would say though, I would've thought it would be a little bit further than where it is at the 80% right now. But the good news is the RFP flow is very strong and we continue to see a significant number of RFPs. I think we have a good chance to win many of those, and it's a very healthy flow of the RFPs that we're getting. And just to give you a sense, I mean, we were really pleased with our 1.41 trailing 12 month book to bill. And if you look at that, I mean, you kind of bring it to our backlog. Our backlog was $14.3 billion, and that was an increase of $300 million from the first quarter. It was also a 21% increase year over year. If you look at our trailing 12 month net orders, they were almost $8 billion and they were up almost 30% year over year. So, with that performance and the continued RFPs that we're seeing, we believe that there's continued significant growth opportunities before us. And then Glenn I don't know if you want to talk any more about the labor costs that we're seeing, but we're seeing that. And we're hearing that not just in drug development, but across different industries, diagnostics, drug development, it's something that we're dealing with. I think we're doing a good job dealing with it, but we're going to have to continue to find ways to reduce costs in other areas as we go through. And then the last thing I would say is if you -- you asked COVID and the percent of our net orders it's, still relatively small, it's less than 3% of our backlog and it's about 7.5% of our net orders over the past four quarters. So overall it's small.\nAaron Wright: Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up on the PLN in preferred lab networks, can you give us an update on that front and how that's helping to potentially kind of steer lab volume? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: So we were added to the PLN for the third year in a row. Unfortunately, with COVID, I don't think there's been a ton of progress made in appeal and it makes a lot of sense and I believe over time it will be the right thing to do and our customers move in that direction. But I've been saying for a couple of years now that I believe we'll have a better answer at the end of the year and then with COVID and everything else has been very difficult to measure or to actually execute on. So we'll continue to provide updates when it becomes meaningful. At this point we're glad that we're on there. We have a great relationship with our colleagues at United and we'll continue to work with them and where we can to help reduce costs and give high quality diagnostic testing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nAnn Hynes: Great. Thank you. I just want to know if you can give any detail on revenue per test for PCR testing and also serology. Also there was increased speculation that the public health emergency might be extended into 2022. If so, do you think labs could maintain the elevated COVID pricing in that scenario? Yep.\nAdam Schechter: Hi, and thanks for the question. If you look at our domestic testing that we do, the price is still in the high eighties, just below 90 frankly. So we continue to maintain a very good price in the United States. If the emergency does move into the next year, I think it will help us with price. Price is going to continue to be under pressure. It's under pressure now. We continue to have a lot of discussions with our colleagues and payers but having emergency declared is certainly a help and enables us to continue to provide the testing that we need. The one thing that's interesting I mentioned before that we continue to keep the capacity that we have despite the fact that it impacts our margins to some degree. And part of the way we're able to do that is because of the emergency and the pricing that we're able to get for this test. If we were in a normal time period, we might've reduced certain things as we saw the total number of tests through the second quarter decline every month. I'm so glad we didn't do that because when all of a sudden there was a significant increase because the Delta variant, we were able to respond. We kept our one day on average turnaround time. And we're going to continue to do that, but the emergency declaration and the price certainly is helpful for us to be able to do that.\nAnn Hynes: And just one follow up. I know that the school opportunity is still an unknown, but if it becomes to fruition, I'm assuming that that revenue per test would be a little lower. Do you have a range what that would be just for modeling purposes, if we wanted to put anything on our models?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, I would say, it depends. If it's a pool pass, you could put 10 people in one test that would be different than if it's an individual test. So really it would depend on the type of testing they would want to do. But I would agree with you that if you're doing surveillance, then it's harder to have the same pricing then when you're actually testing people that are exposed or that have symptoms.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. So I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and spending time with us. It's clear that the second quarter was a very strong one across the enterprise, and that enabled us to increase our full year guidance. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees around the world. Their tireless efforts in their pursuit of answers really have demonstrated our mission to improve health and improve lives around the world. And I'm very grateful for the colleagues that we have that are doing that. As the Delta variant continues to progress and other variants emerge, I encourage everybody to get vaccinated. I really encourage people to get vaccinated as quickly as possible if you're eligible and to stay diligent and vigilant about the disease and the pandemic. We're all in this together. So I look forward to talking to you soon and everybody have a great day. Thank you,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. We remain committed to using extensive diagnostics and drug development capabilities to advance our mission of improving health and improve lives around the world. Innovation, technology and science remains at the forefront and will always do to patients, providers and shareholders. To that end, the second quarter of 2021 was very strong across both diagnostics and drug development. Revenue totalled $3.8 billion a 39% increase from the same period in 2020. Most of this growth was driven by the continued strength in our base businesses. Adjusted EPS reached $6.13 versus $2.50 from the prior year. Free cash flow was $390 million in the quarter versus $272 million in 2020. The strong performance in the quarter and the improved outlook for the year result in us meeting full year guidance for revenue, EPS and cash flow. Glenn will review the new guidance with you in a moment. Our base business continues to recover and were 51% and 32% for diagnostics and drug development respectively. The drug development trailing 12 month book-to-bill remained strong at 1.41. This performance was patients and provider returning to routine healthcare checkups and pharmaceutical clients resuming their important research activities at an even faster pace than expected. Hi Jack and I'll ask Glenn to jump in. So first of all two separate thoughts. One is we continue to execute on our strategy and we continue to do our capital allocation and we've always said, our allocation is focused on strategic acquisitions. You saw one of those where we purchased the remaining interest in Omni this quarter. So oncology is a strategic area. We're looking for ways to enhance our strategic capabilities. And then we said we're going to look to do more hospital resolve, local laboratory acquisitions and you saw one of those this quarter, with what we announced we were doing with one of the hospitals in Minneapolis area, Minnesota. So those are the types of f acquisitions we're going to continue to do. What I would say is the pipeline is as robust as I've ever seen it and frankly I thought we would have couple more close this quarter, but I feel confident we'll close more of those as we go through this year. Separately distinct from that, we continue to make progress on the strategic review and we're going to do this strategic review once we reach the conclusions, we'll look forward to sharing those with you and we expect to do that in the fourth quarter of this year. Glenn? And Ricky maybe just a couple of follow-on comments because as Adam said, we crossed over where our revenue and diagnostic base business really in the fourth quarter of last year was favorable to 2019 levels, but that was driven off of the price mix know we were seeing more tests per session that was making up for the volume shortfall. So June was a signal a month for us, if you will, as we now have crossed over with volume now comparing favorably as well as price mix continues to be higher than normal, but as we continue to progress through the rest of this year and obviously going forward, we expect those to fall more in line with kind of the historical patterns. As your comment on launchpad and really with the tight labor market in particular, but both businesses have launchpad initiatives. We completed drug development one at least publicly last year and this year we'll wrap up our diagnostics business, but that's part of an ongoing business process improvement initiative of the company every single year. We know we have just high inflationary costs as we go into every year and launchpad is really set to offset mitigate those rising costs. So continue to see a lot of opportunities to continue to drive productivity through technology, through the labor efficiency that will continue to help mitigate those costs going forward. Yeah, I'll start with the test question and we can give you some context on the ranges. As we said, the average number of tests per day in the second quarter is 54,000. And if you look at the month of June, it actually was lower than the average of the 54,000. If you would've just trended based upon the June data, you would have been in the 35% to 50% reduction that we had been quoting for the beginning of the year in terms of tasks. But we saw a slight change with the Delta variant and we also saw the extension of the government saying that we're going to continue to be in an emergency situation. And those two things gave us confidence that the reduction in COVID test would be less than what we have originally had in the plan. And that's why we lowered and narrowed the guidance for COVID testing to 33% down to 38% down. So, we really did narrow that and provide some additional guidance there. If you look at those numbers, I know it's still a fairly wide range. It's gone from 33% to 38%, but there's a lot of different ways that you can actually get there. One is by number of tests. And if you start to think about the variant and what we're saying, will that continue. If you start to think about what could happen, if there's a strong flu season or mass or mandated again, in certain states, maybe the flu season will be very light like it was last year, and then the other is obviously price. And the question is, will there continue to be an emergency declaration as we go into the fourth quarter of this year? So what we've tried to do is kind of triangulate in all those different variables, and that's why we give you the range of 33% to 38%, which I think is a good reasonable range for us to be in with the uncertainties that still exist. Yeah. No, I think from our standpoint and why we kind of focus on the 2019 comparison, just to kind of get the back to the more normalcy, if you will. We're still obviously seeing a strong recovery as we compare to 2020, but similarly, when we look at a comp relative to 2020 last year, we saw the trough really being early in the year with the pandemic, and then it got better throughout the year, but we continue to expect to see good growth and favorable margins year on year compared to '20. So really taking a look back to '19 and to your point, diagnostics does definitely has seasonality to the business. So when you look at sequentially, you really have to look at holidays and where the days lay. So we do expect normal seasonal patterns to occur within diagnostics. Again, especially when you look at it relative to '19 more normal times. So from a call it a margin standpoint while we expect margins to be up year on year, we expect them to be flat to slightly down compared to 2019 because of the negative impact of Pama. As far as just the revenue growth we feel good that the volume, again, revenues have been up even compared to '19, but we're seeing the volumes pick up. So volumes will be positive which will be a continued trend, racing mixed should start to come down from where it's been again, as volumes pick up to get back to that more normal patterns, but again, good growth expectations for the second half of this year from volume and from favorable next. And obviously as we go into '22, expect that to continue. Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think they're all important questions as we go through the rest of this year to next year. I'll start with the serology first. At the moment we have the ability to do as many serology tests as we would need to do. The CDC has not come out to recommend utilization of serology to try to understand titers. So therefore not many people are going for serology test so that we can do several thousands every day, but we're prepared to do as many as we may need, but we're also developing and have the ability to do T cell memory testing as well as semi quantitative testing, which ultimately might be helpful if you start to think about a tighter, that you might need to understand the weighting of effectiveness of vaccines over time. So what I would say is we are prepared for whatever might be necessary and we're building capacity to be ready for whatever that could be. My personal point of view is that I believe that serology testing over time will be more important, particularly if vaccination is not going to be every single year, if it could be less or more than a year and if it could be different by individuals, then I think you're going to need significant serology testing and that's why we continue to develop it. With regard to back to school, we're having a lot of discussions about back to school. We're prepared to do as PCR testing, as we may need for back to school, whether it be through individual tests or through pooling. But to be honest, they've really been discussions. We haven't seen a lot of schools willing to pull the trigger and say, we're going to put in a significant back to school testing program. So we're going to have to wait and see and even though we're having a lot of discussions within the range that we've provided up to down 33% to down 38%, there's multiple different ways you can get there. One would be a lot of back to school testing, but a lower price. Other ways it'd be not much back the school testing, but you could continue to have growth in other areas. And then the last thing I would say is, it's truly to give the end of July, but as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, we're certainly starting to see numbers that are not yet there, but closer to the average that we had the last quarter versus where we ended for the month of June. Yeah, again, if you look at COVID testing or molecular tests, and if you look at the number of molecular tests that we do as a percent of the total 530 million or so tests that we perform every year, it's still a very, very small amount. So even though there might be additional capacity in hospitals or laboratories for molecular types tests, it wouldn't have a significant impact on our overall business, frankly. Yeah. So the first thing I'd say there is that we're still working through 2021. We're obviously not providing guidance today for 2022, but the reason we're trying to break out our base business versus our covert testing is to really give you a better sense of how to start to think about 2021. And if you take up a base business, we expect to get back to normal growth rates that you would have seen prior to the pandemic. The part that we're still trying to figure out is what could COVID testing look like as we go to 2021? And that's the entire reason that we're giving you the different pieces to try to help think about it as we get there next year. Yeah, what I would say is if you look at esoteric testing, which includes ecology that actually went down less than the other testing that we do more routine testing at the beginning of the pandemic. But as we stand here today, they both come back and, it looks about what you would expect. It's about a 60% to 40% breakout of our business, 60% on a more standard testing in revenue and about 40% on the esoteric, including oncology. So we see them both coming back. I'll let Glenn give some specific, but in general, we expect a test for a session to come back to pre COVID levels over time, and we're already starting to see that a bit. But Glenn maybe you can give some additional context. Yeah. So if you look at pixel it ranges anywhere from 4% to maybe 8% at the peak of the percent of total PCR tests that we do. So it's a part of the armor where they have people that use it really appreciate it. It's now available in 6,000 Walgreens stores and things like Jordache and Instacart but it's been relatively consistent at about 4% or so of the total tests that we do and the margin isn't that different than other margins. Sure. I'll give you some additional context the business. The first thing I would say is about 80% of sites are currently open. So we still have sites around the world that have not yet fully open to allow us to go into help them enroll patients. But, we would expect continued improvement there as we go through the year. I would say though, I would've thought it would be a little bit further than where it is at the 80% right now. But the good news is the RFP flow is very strong and we continue to see a significant number of RFPs. I think we have a good chance to win many of those, and it's a very healthy flow of the RFPs that we're getting. And just to give you a sense, I mean, we were really pleased with our 1.41 trailing 12 month book to bill. And if you look at that, I mean, you kind of bring it to our backlog.

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I am going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full-year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion an increase of 38.7% over last year due to organic growth of 35.5%, acquisitions of 1.2% and favourable foreign currency translation of 200 basis points. Our organic base business increased 42.4% when compared to our base business last year, while COVID testing revenues of $444 million were flat with last year. Hi Brian. Thanks very much for the question. So Covance had a very strong quarter and if you look at our Labcorp drug development business in total, we had progress in all parts of the drug development business all three grew strong into double-digits and as I look at the margins going forward, I've always said be careful to look at any one quarter of the margin especially as were going through COVID. There are certain areas where we continue to maintain people and when we maintain those people, were doing it because we're going through COVID and we know we're going to need them for after COVID. So some of our margins look a little bit odd from quarter to quarter. We're also seeing a slight increase in the material cost and labor cost which people are seeing in almost every industry, but we're going to continues to offset that with things like our launchpad initiatives. So I'd look at the margin on a yearly basis and we believe that this year will be better than last year which was better than the year before and I would expect as we go into next year in our drug development business, the margins will look better than this year. So we're going to continue to find ways to expand our margins moving forward. Jack, the only thing I'd add is you're right, our targeted leverage, has been the 2.5 to 3 times and a couple of things are going, obviously we have the benefit of the COVID testing, which has generated and helped our free cash flow this year, which has helped improved it. But also when you look at the improvement in our EBITDA, because of COVID testing, it's higher than normal. So as you do look at our leverage relative to call it pre pandemic, you using a profile on the 2019, you'd get that are leveraged. Currently gross debt to EBITDA is towards the upper end of our range. Having said that as Adam commented on, we expect to use our free cash flow this year for M&A and share repurchases. The midpoint of our range a little bit over $2 billion. We spent around $400 million so far in the first half of the year. So the Alyssa say it implies that the second half you'll see more capital allocation given to both share repurchases and M&A and spoke to the strength of our M&A pipeline, which again, gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to deploy more towards M&A than we've done in the first half, but we'll continue to use our share repurchase program as well. Yeah, Kevin, yeah, Adam actually commented a little bit in the remarks also that looking quarter to quarter, obviously, you do have issues on seasonality and just timing related things in that the comparison year over year, it gives you a pretty strong view of how our margins are doing, which again, in both businesses from a base business standpoint are up nicely. When you look at Covance though to your point, sequentially, you move from kind of the first quarter to the second margins were down principally, related to COVID testing was down within that segment. The level of COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies was down compared to the first quarter. We had higher pass-throughs in the second quarter versus the first and obviously the tight labor market also impacting it. So a lot of things that will impact a quarter to quarter kind of change. What we commented on is that the second half margins within drug development, we expect to be higher than the first half and that for the full year, we expect it to be up over the prior year. So we feel good about how the business is leveraging the top line growth from the base business standpoint. So of course we look at that closely. We've included what we think are the range of potential things that could occur within the guidance that we provided today. I think everybody's facing a tough labor market in most industries as we speak. And we're just going to have to continue to find ways through launchpad and other ways to reduce costs to cover that in the future. So we'll continue to find ways to take out costs in other areas, through things like virtual clinical trials and those types of things. Yeah. So let me start Ricky with the base business. So, the diagnostics we saw the base business rebound nicely. And one thing is to look at revenue, which is what you stated, but the other thing is to look at volume. And for the first time, since the pandemic, we saw the volume increase in June of this year compared to June of 2019. So that's a good sign and it shows, continued recovery. As we look at July, it's still too early to give any sense of that. But our expectation throughout this year is that we will see continued volume and revenue growth versus 2019 and that will continue throughout this year. Yeah, Ralph, the only thing, I guess I would add to that is that what ranges are, we don't disagree this year or kind of wider than they would be in a normal year and just reflects the lack of visibility and the uncertainty that's ahead of us. Having said that with the new guidance that we provided, we've not only narrowed the ranges. So we've trumped the range given that we have six months remaining, we give annual guidance and more importantly, we've increased the call it the midpoints of all the key financial metrics that we guide to. So reflecting the company's performance. So when you look at the midpoint of a range, as you would expect, that's kind of where we see things if we were to have to kind of put in a point, but we then give the ranges around it because there was a lot of things that on the positive or the negative side that could occur overall. And as Adam said, with regards specifically to the COVID testing again, narrowing the range and improving it. But what we did see, which was the first time, which we didn't have when we gave our guidance last quarter, was that we've seen a sequential decline in COVID testing each month as we've gone through the year, as Adam said with June being the lower than the average for the quarter. For July was the first month, frankly, that we've seen the level of COVID testing higher than the prior month. And so obviously with the advent of the Delta virus the advent of the extension of the public health emergency gives us reason to feel now better about where we are with COVID testing for this year, then we did just have a quarter ago, but still with a lot of uncertainty that's ahead of us. Yeah, no, it's exactly right. Sequentially the test per session impact was less than it was in the first quarter, but obviously the volume levels were much higher in the second quarter then than the first quarter as well. So you will ultimately get back to that more sense of normalcy over time."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Labcorp Q1 2021 Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chas Cook. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our focus continues to be on bringing innovations to market that help improve people's health and lives. As you'll see from our first quarter results, doing so can generate strong growth and returns for our shareholders. I'm going to begin by covering our overall performance in the first quarter, which is very strong across all of our businesses.  Revenue increased 47% versus the same period in 2020. While a good amount of growth can be attributed to COVID testing, we also delivered 15% year-over-year growth in our base business. In Diagnostics and Drug Development, base business revenue increased 8% and 24%, respectively, from the prior year. Our drug development book-to-bill remains very strong and reached 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. Our adjusted EPS of $8.79 represents significant growth from last year. And we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up from $97 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the year enabled us to increase our full year guidance. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2021 full year guidance.  Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 47.4% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 45%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 32.9% and organic base business growth of 12.2%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.1 billion or 25.4% of revenue. \nOperator: Are you there?\nGlenn Eisenberg: There we go, operator. We can hear you.\nOperator: Sorry about that. I don't know what happened. You could continue.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Okay. I think we've completed our formal remarks, and we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: . And your first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to start with the Covance performance. So I was calculating new awards up 60% year-over-year, which would make Labcorp #1 so far in the quarter. So Adam, I was wondering, is that math right? Were there any chunky awards to call out? And can you maybe talk about the relative performance of each of the businesses within Drug Development?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Jack, no, your math is about right, and we're very pleased with the performance of all the businesses, frankly, Diagnostics and each of the businesses in Drug Development. Central Laboratory was particularly strong, but we saw good growth in early stage as well in late-stage. And as I mentioned on previous calls, we had recently won some larger pharmaceutical clients that are helping with our book-to-bill. So if you look at our book-to-bill, it reached a record of 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. And the total backlog, as you said, grew to $13.97 billion. And I'll just add to that, that only a very small percent of that backlog is related to COVID work. So it's really related to the other therapeutic areas.\nJack Meehan: Great. And maybe building off that, Glenn, you mentioned in the prepared remarks how the stacked growth is somewhere in the mid-teens. As you think about how this backlog growth is going to convert over the next year or a few years, how do you think the near-term trend rate for Covance is looking? Are you going to have tough comps as we're looking out a year from now? Or do you think there's just a lot of work to burn through for some time?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, we have seen over the past several quarters a little bit of a decline in the conversion rate. We're now at around 33%. And it's, as you know, relative to the mix of business that we're doing, more oncology work that we're seeing, good growth in our backlog, as Adam commented. So right now, we continue to have a lot of good momentum. Our orders continue to be very strong. We're building up a very strong backlog, again, at $14 billion. So nothing from our view long term would change. Obviously, in the first quarter especially, you'll see kind of a really strong growth rate in part because of the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic studies that we have that at some point will obviously start to taper off.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.\nErin Wright: Great. Another one on the Covance business here. There's obviously a ton of promotion in the CRO space right now. What are you seeing in terms of opportunities from some of the potential disruption there, whether it's win rates or employee recruitment? And on the flip side of that, does the ongoing strategic review change any of your own relationships with customers? I assume it doesn't, given the latest bookings trends that you just posted. But do you see also further consolidation across the CRO space from here? Or do you see the need to add scale to the Covance business as always, a controversial topic.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So first of all, Erin, thanks for the questions. Whenever you have large-scale integrations or mergers and consolidation, you see some interruption of business. So we're going to be prepared to take advantage of whatever is out there in terms of disruption distractions of companies that are being acquired or that are going through the significant integrations. Integrations are just hard to do.  We've said all along that we believe that there was going to be additional consolidation in the industry. So it's not a surprise to us. I mean we're aware of the marketplace and all the competitors. And obviously, we know what's happening. At the same time, we've always said you need a certain level of critical mass to be successful. And the good news is we have that critical mass. And as you said, Erin, you can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the strength of our book-to-bill, you can see it in the strength of our ability to continue to grow in the Covance business. So we know the industry, we know the other players very well. And that's a great thing about Labcorp. I mean everybody comes and talks to us. At the same time, we feel like we're in a very strong position.  With regard to your second question was, as we go through a strategic review, we're focused on executing in the marketplace. And we're not going to lose focus and we're not going to spend time in the vast majority of our organization, they're just meeting the needs of our clients and our customers every single day. It's going to be the Board, the management team that are working together to do this thorough review. And We're not going to distract the largest parts of our organization. We're going to keep them focused on delivering. Hopefully, you see that our execution in the marketplace has been really strong across Diagnostics and Drug Development. It's been strong with everything we're doing for COVID. It's been strong in our base business. I mean our base business for the overall grew 15%, and the base business for Diagnostics was up 8%. Drug Development was up 24%. So you see strength there. That's because we're so focused on executing on the needs of our customers. And we're going to continue to do that while we also perform the strategic review.\nErin Wright: Okay. And switching over to the Diagnostics segment. I guess, in your view, how has the competitive landscape changed as we emerge from the pandemic here with some emerging smaller labs and other entities stepping up investments and testing capabilities? Does this change any of your outlook from a consolidation standpoint at this point across the core clinical lab space?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. And a couple of parts to answer. The first thing is that if you look at people that have built capabilities to do COVID testing, those are really doing molecular testing. Molecular testing is a very, very small part of the 530 million or so tests that Labcorp does a year. So no matter how much capacity is out there for molecular testing, I don't think that there would be a significant impact to our business with new competition that can do some molecular tests.  What I do believe is that some of those competitors are not going to be able to make it with just COVID testing as we've seen the number of tests per day go down. And therefore, I believe there will continue to be consolidation in the industry. And frankly, that's something that we'll continue to look at. We've always said that acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, even regional laboratories are a great way for us to use our capital. We know how to integrate those. They return their cost of capital very quickly, and they're accretive typically in the first year. So we'll look for opportunities for continued consolidation, but not just in the smaller new competitors, but also in the hospitals and other laboratories.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nDan Leonard: Another question on the Drug Development business, big growth year-on-year in the new awards but off of a lower base. Can you comment on the book-to-bill ratio in the quarter? And on your upper trailing 12, but specifically for the quarter and if you felt like you were winning your pro rata share of bookings and anything to be aware of on the monthly trend front?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Dan, it's Glenn. As you know, we do a book-to-bill on a trailing 12 number, and again, a record level of 1 4 7. So it's picked up nicely from the prior trailing 12 months. So obviously, it implies, obviously, a very good quarter. We tend not to give the quarterly numbers because we don't want it to be focused on the quarter. Obviously, this is done over the years, but it's fair to say that we feel we had a very good quarter, and it was enough to meaningfully bump up our trailing 12-month level.\nAdam Schechter: And I would also say, Dan, is if you look at RFPs, they continue to be coming in strong. If you look at investment from pharma and biotech, it continues to be strong. And we continue to win at a minimum, our share move even a bit better.\nDan Leonard: And then my follow-up, can you elaborate a bit more on the drivers of the organic growth in your base business in Diagnostics? It seems like the health care system hasn't fully normalized yet, doing 6% organic is better than industry. So maybe if there's more granular detail you could offer on the drivers there.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, Dan, we've been really pleased with the pace of the recovery in Diagnostics, frankly, coming in a little stronger than what we would have expected, which, again, is one of the reasons we've increased the guidance that we have for Diagnostics. When you look at the breakup of the, call it, the 6% plus organic revenue growth, volumes are still down year-on-year. They were down around 1.3% but actually would have been favorable if you took out the negative impact from weather.  So we've really started to see the trend change. And when you think about it, not too surprising when you're comping now at the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the pandemic impact last year. But what we're equally pleased to see is that the volume levels continue to improve while still be down from 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Low single digits as well.  And so while revenue continues to be up year-on-year to '20, while revenues continue to be up compounded compared to '19, kind of a normalized year, volumes are still a little bit down. And our expectation continues to be that the volume levels will now start to kind of kick in above '19 levels, call it at the middle of the year. But the good news is that we -- while volumes are still a little bit soft compared to historical levels, we're making that up on our price/mix, which we're attributing more to the number of tests we're doing because we report volume on an accession basis. So maybe fewer visits to the physicians, but they're doing more tests for each of those visits, but good momentum that we're continuing to see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: You mentioned in your prepared comments, capital allocation would accelerate over the course of the year. Is the strategic review part -- was that the reason why there wasn't really much capital deployed in 1Q? Your buyback was $69 million. M&A was $34 million. And then I guess, the second half of that is, how should we really think about capital deployment in total, meaning is there a target in terms of buybacks? Is there a target -- total allocation been built into these numbers?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Kevin, to your point, what we've said in our guidance overall is that the free cash flow that we're going to generate this year, call it, the $1.8 billion to $2 billion, we expect to deploy between M&A and share repurchases. We tend to start off slower in the first quarter, just historically, even with our buyback program just to let the year a little bit unfold and see what the M&A opportunities are there. We continue, as Adam said, to have really a strong pipeline of M&A transactions. The reason why we said we were accelerating especially on the share repurchase side because we can obviously you unilaterally control that, is that with 1 quarter under our belt 3 to go, we still have that midpoint of 1.9 to fully deploy. So you would normally expect that instead of it just being done all towards the end of the year, you'll start to see a pickup. But we're encouraged with the pipeline of deals that we feel we can do. We're encouraged, obviously, that we'll continue to redeploy our capital with M&A. And from our perspective, we're on track with what we were expecting to see happen.\nAdam Schechter: And Kevin, just to give you a sense of how we think about it. I mean, we've always said that local hospitals, regional or laboratories, local laboratories, those would be things that we would look to acquire. And as I said before, they're accretive in the first year, return cost of capital in a couple of years, and we know how to integrate those really well. We then look for strategic acquisitions that are typically tuck-ins like we did with Global Care last year, Snap IoT that helped us with our decentralized clinical trials. There may be some things in oncology or other parts of our strategy where we want to reinforce our position, and that's the second place we look. And then, of course, we're opportunistic with the buybacks. And we look at all 3 of those.\nKevin Caliendo: Okay. And just 1 follow-up. One quick follow-up is the -- is the biggest delta between the high end and low end of your guidance still PCR volumes? Or is there something else that would sort of be the biggest net mover of earnings for the rest of the year?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Well, again, if you're -- one of the reasons, again, we've broken out the guidance between our underlying base business and the COVID testing is such that we can give various ranges for the 2. And clearly, there's a little bit more uncertainty visibility, if you will, on the level of PCR testing depending on what's going on with, obviously, the pandemic and how it impacts. So from our perspective, when we gave that range, we've said 2 things. That it's going to be a combination of different volume levels, but also potentially different levels of pricing. So right now, we obviously had a very strong first quarter relative to PCR volumes, 112,000 tests per day. But we ended the quarter at kind of the 80,000 test per day level. So you can see that we continue to see and expect that volume levels will continue to trail down. But again, we'll see if it picks up again, if you will. But at the midpoint, we're clearly considering that the volumes will come down.  And there's also pricing. With CMS, we've always held to the pricing on the reimbursement We continue to do that. At some point, that pricing may change. CMS may change their pricing reimbursement. So there's just a lot of variability. So at this point, we continue to do. We have all the capacity there. Our turnaround times are extremely strong. And so we're just meeting the needs that are out there.\nAdam Schechter: And Kevin, I think the good news is that our base business is strong. And that's why we're able to increase the guidance in both of our base businesses. And frankly, that's the long-term success that we expect to have in the base business.  If you look at the PCR testing today and you looked at our range between down 35% and down 50%, you would actually get closer to down 50% today versus the 35%. But let's see what happens because in November, there could be another outbreak of the flu, and therefore, a lot of people might come in for PCR tests. Where we have back to school and the kids are going back to school, whether be large-scale screening. So that's why we've given ranges in both, and that's where we have a much broader range for PCR testing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: I want to probe a little more into the guidance and more around trying to figure out baseline earnings this year, excluding COVID. I know midpoint of guidance, you said COVID revenue, $1.6 billion. But it sounds like you're trending towards sort of the lower end of that. But even if I take that sort of lower end, based on my math, I'm still coming up with maybe $6 to $7 of EPS contribution. Do you think it's a fair ballpark?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Again, there it's -- we guide to the revenue. Obviously, we've talked a little bit about kind of the leverage that we get on that volume for PCR depending upon the pricing. So we've talked about it being kind of north of our 65% incremental leverage on PCR volumes. Kind of comparable, but a little bit north of what we would normally have seen like on incremental volume from weather, if you will. So as Adam said, when we gave our guidance, we give a range. Obviously, the midpoint is kind of where the most expectations. But clearly, we could see our way to getting higher at the upper end and other things that could be headwinds on the lower end.  The reason we commented on the PCR one is that it's a little bit south of the center point is because, one, that's what we're currently seeing on the trends. But two, as Adam said, we could see it pick up again. So we were just trying to provide some color. And given where the extension of the public health emergency continues to go out, if it gets extended again, that could reinforce better pricing than what -- that would hold our pricing, which would be an improvement because we do assume in some of the scenarios we'll see lower pricing overall.  But when you look at our earnings, and it's kind of interesting, we obviously had a very solid first quarter and you compare it to, call it, the midpoint of the guidance that we give for earnings for the year, we had a much higher percentage of earnings than we would historically do. We tend to try to track not this precisely, but let's say, 1/4 of our earnings would normally be -- or 1 quarter, a quarter of the year. Here, we did around 40% of our earnings. And frankly, in the second quarter, I think it's fair to say It will be a strong quarter relative to the full year as well because we're still going to have another strong quarter of COVID testing, even though it will be less than what we saw in the first quarter.  From our standpoint, the bigger question will be the second half of the year, which was really where we do expect to see a decline in volumes and potentially a declining in pricing. But there's still that uncertainty out there that could potentially be upside if the volume levels hold up greater and the pricing holds up greater. But there's just a wide range of outcomes.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question. Any update on school testing, I guess, broadly? And then more specifically on the K3 program that I think is going to be announced shortly, could you just help us -- did you guys bid for a coordinator role in 4 regions? Or will you just be 1 of the up to 10, I guess, labs to serve the program? And is there any way to sort of size or frame the opportunity as you see it?\nAdam Schechter: No, it's a great question. And we did bid on certain regions, and we do expect that we would be 1 of the labs, irrespective if we have 1 of the hubs or not. So we expect to be involved in both, but we'll see as it plays out. At the minimum, it's hard to imagine where you wouldn't need the capacity and the capabilities we have for the testing itself. It's really going to come down to how many schools want to implement the screening. And as more and more people are vaccinated, as more parts of the country are opening up, I mean, almost fully in certain parts of the country, it's hard to tell to be honest, how many schools are going to say, we're going to want to screen on a fairly often basis all of our students.  So we -- as we said, that's why we have this broad kind of guidance between down 35% and down 50%. We're turning more down towards the 50%. But if the schools were bigger and actually do a lot of testing, well, then we did go the other way in the range. But right now, we're not expecting that to be a very significant amount. And that's why we kept the range where it is.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: First question on the Diagnostics side. If we think about the base business, organic growth for core business was up 70 basis points when you adjust for the weather. I suspect there was also sort of an impact of the light flu season that contributed there. So i.e., that if we normalize for that, core testing would have been even higher. Maybe you can give us a sense of those dynamics. And also, one thing that's very clear from all the details you're giving is that you are growing faster than your closest competitor, both on core testing and on PCR testing. And while some of it could be geographic, I think that core testing would grow faster geographically, PCR testing not. So can you talk a little bit about share dynamics that you're seeing?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, Ricky. So a couple of things. First of all, Our base business, as you say, is very strong. And it's strong across Diagnostics for Drug Development and frankly, each area of Drug Development. When you look at the diagnostics, we're seeing that people are coming back to the more routine health care. And if you look at the volume and you compare it to 2019, it's only down in the low single digits now versus if you look at the end of last year, it was in the mid- to upper single digits. So we've seen continued improvement in people coming back to the routine test.  The other thing that we're seeing is that for each blood draw, that there's more tests being run in that blood draw than historically happened. And the question is, will that be maintained? We are hypothesizing that some people have been out of health care for a while. So when they finally do go to their doctor or telemedicine, they're doing a lot of tests just to check on people's overall health, and therefore, that might not continue over time. But on the other hand, it may. And we're going to have to watch that closely in terms of how many tests per accession we see over time.  There's no doubt that the Diagnostic team is executing extraordinarily well in the marketplace. The team is focused. They're energized. They're doing a great job. They've worked through COVID. Our sales folks were out there the entire time doing whatever they could where doctors' offices were open, doing things remotely. One of our platforms for our key pillars of our strategy was digitalization. So we were able to do a lot of things digitally through the pandemic that historically we would not have been able to do. So I agree with your assessment that we're performing well in the marketplace versus others.\nRicky Goldwasser: Okay. And then on the CRO business, I mean, the one thing that I think that we're clearly seeing from the industry consolidation is that scale matters more and more. Your competitors are becoming bigger. So just kind of like any thoughts of how you think about Covance core clinical scale, excluding the Central Lab business. And just kind of like how you think that competitive environment is going to evolve.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No. So first of all, I'd say, if you look at the 3 pieces of our business, and I'll break them quite individually. If you look at our early-stage business, we have scale. And we're strong and we're a leader in that business, and it performs very well. If you look at our central laboratory business, we're a leader there as well. We have scale, we can compete. And I've said all along that we have the scale that we need in late-stage clinical trials. That's the area that as you get more trials, you can scale the quickest. And you can do that to some degree organically. You don't necessarily have to scale in clinical trials inorganically. So for example, we wanted to have more capabilities in China and Japan, we were able to build scale for clinical development in those countries fairly quickly. So we see what's happening in the marketplace. We understand the marketplace well. We understand the importance of scale. And to me, it's a certain level of scale you need to have and then you can be successful. And I believe we have the level of scale across each of our three businesses that we need.\nRicky Goldwasser: And then one last question. I wanted to follow up on what you said. You said that you're seeing more people coming back to do routine health care. Acuity is something that the market is very, very focused on. And you see sort of what type of tests are being ordered, which I think are positively correlated or correlation with acuity level. Any sense there in terms of what type of tests you're seeing being ordered?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So Ricky, so we've seen all of the business come back, whether it be our base business or it'd be our esoteric business. In the first quarter, we saw a little bit more of the base business coming back. We think it was probably because people were getting physicals and the year was starting. It's typical to see that base business perform a bit better in the first quarter. Esoteric business continues to be pretty consistent because when people need to get one of those tests, they get it irrespective of the time of the year. So there's not a really significant difference versus what we would expect to see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Just thinking about your comments on pricing expectations later in the year. Thinking out COVID, how are you thinking about the durability of pricing in the base business ex the COVID testing that we're seeing right now?\nAdam Schechter: Brian, when I look at the business, the pricing is always under some pressure, but it's pretty asymptotic. It doesn't tend to be significantly more pressure over time than not. And the pricing is pretty stable. I feel good about our volume. I feel good about our pricing as we go into the future. Obviously, PAMA right now, we're having our base case that there'll be an impact next year. And we expect that will be about the same as it was in 2019, around $100 million mark. But at the same time, we think that there's ways to get through that and be able to be successful through that.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing, too, Brian, that I'd add is I agree that from a unit pricing standpoint, exactly as Adam has conveyed it. When we talk about price, we also do price mix. And so as you see that the volume levels are coming back, you'll see the price mix come down a little bit. Again, when you think about it and now those people are going to the physician's office more normally, you'll start to see a more normal cadence of how many tests per session they would have. So especially as we continue to grow, when we talk about a normal historical growth rate of kind of 2% to 3%, if you will, in, call it, the organic revenue with 1% to 2% coming from volume, one from price. So we normally always still do expect to have a contribution from favorable price mix. But given that the volume levels have been negative from year-over-year comparisons, we've seen an unusually high price/mix. So again, as we get more to normal, so you'll see both kind of fall back into where we would normally expect it to be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair.\nMatthew Larew: Given some goalposts around what you expect  molecular look like in 2021. But do you have a sense or maybe give us some sort of wider goalpost around what it could look like in 2022? Do you think potentially down another 50%? And then the second piece of that would be, you talked about leveraging the experience and expertise you've gained through COVID. But what about sort of the substantial footprint and capacity that you've built out to meet COVID demand? How do you leverage that moving forward?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Matt. So it's hard to predict where 2021 is going to end up. That's why we have such a broad range. It makes it even more difficult to predict 2022. What I would say is part of it is going to depend on how long the vaccines work for. Are we going to need a booster shot every year? Is it going to last for several years? Part of it is going to depend on how tough the flu seasons are. So there's still a lot of unknowns as we go to 2022. I mean I would expect there will still be testing for COVID in 2022 that we'll be doing. The level of which will be determined to some degree by the vaccines. But on the other hand, if the vaccines last a longer period of time, will we need to do more serology tests? Will we need to do more T cell testing? I think that the story is still going to be written as we learn more scientifically. And PCR testing will play a role, but serology and/or T cell, another test may play a very different role as we go into 2022 and beyond.  With regard to the testing capabilities that we've built, the machinery, we can still use a lot of that. I mean we use it for our other tests. There might be some excess capacity that has to be written off over time. But for us, it wouldn't be a significant issue where others that all they do is COVID testing and all they've done is build capacity for that, I think they'll have a significant issue. We're in very good shape there, frankly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: So I wanted to follow up on the longer-term COD testing you were just discussing. So I wanted to say where do you think the testing for is for reference labs in the long term given the vaccine rollout but also more variants come in. And also the testing decentralization happening right now? And then a follow-up for related question for that is for the excess capacity in the future from all of this testing roll-off. I wanted to see if you could comment more on what sort of maybe strategic tuck-ins in the testing side that you'll be focusing on?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So again, with the longer-term COA testing, it's early to understand exactly how that's going to play out. Part of it is going to depend on vaccines, but part of it will also depend on if we have good therapeutics. So for example, if we get to next year and it's a big flu season, And if somebody gets COVID, they still have a high likelihood of being hospitalized and/or dying from COVID. I think people are going to want to use a molecular PCR test and have it done by us. If there's great therapeutics and if people get COVID, they end up not being hospitalized and they can be managed from their home and it's more like the flu, then I think you might find more testing that's done in physicians' offices. So really, it's going to depend on how the science plays out. I assume there will be some testing needed in the long term that we'll be doing. But obviously, it will be significantly less over time than what we've done in the past.  To me, the real question continues to be, will there be a role for serology? Will we need to know if people are still immune to the disease or are vaccinated and have titers at the right level for the disease. And there might be other tests in the future that play a more important role than they do today, and we'll have to continue to watch that.  The last thing I'd say is with regard to capacity in the future, I've seen some countries that are going to use that capacity to do significantly more screening for things like HCV or HIV, things where molecular tests are done routinely today, but they're routinely done to diagnose versus the screen. So there might be some opportunities to do those types of things. But in general, as I said, molecular testing is a very small amount of the 530 million tests or so that we do every year. And therefore, for us, it's not going to be a significant issue. I feel very optimistic as I look at our base businesses moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nJustin Bowers: This is Justin Bowers on for Pito. And nice strength across both segments this quarter. But digging into diagnostics a little more, can you give us a sense of what you saw across different regions of the country. And then as you look at your different customer base, whether it's like physician order test or reference labs, can you tell us what inform us what trends are like in the quarter there? And then lastly, where are you guys tracking now on daily PCR tests versus kind of where you exited in March?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So some of the first thing I'll answer the last question first. We exited the quarter averaging around 80,000 tests per day. We averaged for the quarter about 113,000 tests per day. So you saw a continued decline.  With regard to geographical differences, weather was probably a bigger impact than other things. So when we saw the Northeast get hit by weather, there was a 2% impact. A lot of it came from where the weather was, obviously. In Texas, we saw a significant issue with what was occurring there at some point when electricity was out for a week. So it was more driven, I believe, by that than it was differences in other testing. Obviously, you're going to see some differences by geography as different parts of the country open up in different ways at different times. But frankly, you saw strength pretty much across all parts of the country when you compare it to where we were at the end of last year.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. So thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'll end by saying we remain optimistic about the progress against the virus, albeit certain parts of the world continue to be impacted significantly, and our thoughts are with them as they continue to go through the devastation from the virus. But in the U.S., we are very optimistic about where we are and how things are progressing.  We are very pleased to see our base businesses perform well across every single area of our business. And we're seeing that as people go back to the normal lives and their normal health care routines in the United States, but we're also seeing pharma and biotech colleagues begin to perform their important research and development, particularly in therapeutic areas outside of COVID.  As you can see, our first quarter was very strong. It was a strong quarter of performance. I think we executed in the marketplace very well. We look forward to continuing to execute on our mission to improve health and improve lives, and we look forward to talking with you soon. Thanks for the time today.\nOperator: Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our focus continues to be on bringing innovations to market that help improve people's health and lives. As you'll see from our first quarter results, doing so can generate strong growth and returns for our shareholders. I'm going to begin by covering our overall performance in the first quarter, which is very strong across all of our businesses.  Revenue increased 47% versus the same period in 2020. While a good amount of growth can be attributed to COVID testing, we also delivered 15% year-over-year growth in our base business. In Diagnostics and Drug Development, base business revenue increased 8% and 24%, respectively, from the prior year. Our drug development book-to-bill remains very strong and reached 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. Our adjusted EPS of $8.79 represents significant growth from last year. And we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up from $97 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the year enabled us to increase our full year guidance. Yes. Jack, no, your math is about right, and we're very pleased with the performance of all the businesses, frankly, Diagnostics and each of the businesses in Drug Development. Central Laboratory was particularly strong, but we saw good growth in early stage as well in late-stage. And as I mentioned on previous calls, we had recently won some larger pharmaceutical clients that are helping with our book-to-bill. So if you look at our book-to-bill, it reached a record of 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. And the total backlog, as you said, grew to $13.97 billion. And I'll just add to that, that only a very small percent of that backlog is related to COVID work. So it's really related to the other therapeutic areas. Yes. So first of all, Erin, thanks for the questions. Whenever you have large-scale integrations or mergers and consolidation, you see some interruption of business. So we're going to be prepared to take advantage of whatever is out there in terms of disruption distractions of companies that are being acquired or that are going through the significant integrations. Integrations are just hard to do.  We've said all along that we believe that there was going to be additional consolidation in the industry. So it's not a surprise to us. I mean we're aware of the marketplace and all the competitors. And obviously, we know what's happening. At the same time, we've always said you need a certain level of critical mass to be successful. And the good news is we have that critical mass. And as you said, Erin, you can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the strength of our book-to-bill, you can see it in the strength of our ability to continue to grow in the Covance business. So we know the industry, we know the other players very well. And that's a great thing about Labcorp. I mean everybody comes and talks to us. At the same time, we feel like we're in a very strong position.  With regard to your second question was, as we go through a strategic review, we're focused on executing in the marketplace. And we're not going to lose focus and we're not going to spend time in the vast majority of our organization, they're just meeting the needs of our clients and our customers every single day. It's going to be the Board, the management team that are working together to do this thorough review. And We're not going to distract the largest parts of our organization. We're going to keep them focused on delivering. Hopefully, you see that our execution in the marketplace has been really strong across Diagnostics and Drug Development. It's been strong with everything we're doing for COVID. It's been strong in our base business. I mean our base business for the overall grew 15%, and the base business for Diagnostics was up 8%. Drug Development was up 24%. So you see strength there. That's because we're so focused on executing on the needs of our customers. And we're going to continue to do that while we also perform the strategic review. Yes. And a couple of parts to answer. The first thing is that if you look at people that have built capabilities to do COVID testing, those are really doing molecular testing. Molecular testing is a very, very small part of the 530 million or so tests that Labcorp does a year. So no matter how much capacity is out there for molecular testing, I don't think that there would be a significant impact to our business with new competition that can do some molecular tests.  What I do believe is that some of those competitors are not going to be able to make it with just COVID testing as we've seen the number of tests per day go down. And therefore, I believe there will continue to be consolidation in the industry. And frankly, that's something that we'll continue to look at. We've always said that acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, even regional laboratories are a great way for us to use our capital. We know how to integrate those. They return their cost of capital very quickly, and they're accretive typically in the first year. So we'll look for opportunities for continued consolidation, but not just in the smaller new competitors, but also in the hospitals and other laboratories. And I would also say, Dan, is if you look at RFPs, they continue to be coming in strong. If you look at investment from pharma and biotech, it continues to be strong. And we continue to win at a minimum, our share move even a bit better. And Kevin, just to give you a sense of how we think about it. I mean, we've always said that local hospitals, regional or laboratories, local laboratories, those would be things that we would look to acquire. And as I said before, they're accretive in the first year, return cost of capital in a couple of years, and we know how to integrate those really well. We then look for strategic acquisitions that are typically tuck-ins like we did with Global Care last year, Snap IoT that helped us with our decentralized clinical trials. There may be some things in oncology or other parts of our strategy where we want to reinforce our position, and that's the second place we look. And then, of course, we're opportunistic with the buybacks. And we look at all 3 of those. And Kevin, I think the good news is that our base business is strong. And that's why we're able to increase the guidance in both of our base businesses. And frankly, that's the long-term success that we expect to have in the base business.  If you look at the PCR testing today and you looked at our range between down 35% and down 50%, you would actually get closer to down 50% today versus the 35%. But let's see what happens because in November, there could be another outbreak of the flu, and therefore, a lot of people might come in for PCR tests. Where we have back to school and the kids are going back to school, whether be large-scale screening. So that's why we've given ranges in both, and that's where we have a much broader range for PCR testing. No, it's a great question. And we did bid on certain regions, and we do expect that we would be 1 of the labs, irrespective if we have 1 of the hubs or not. So we expect to be involved in both, but we'll see as it plays out. At the minimum, it's hard to imagine where you wouldn't need the capacity and the capabilities we have for the testing itself. It's really going to come down to how many schools want to implement the screening. And as more and more people are vaccinated, as more parts of the country are opening up, I mean, almost fully in certain parts of the country, it's hard to tell to be honest, how many schools are going to say, we're going to want to screen on a fairly often basis all of our students.  So we -- as we said, that's why we have this broad kind of guidance between down 35% and down 50%. We're turning more down towards the 50%. But if the schools were bigger and actually do a lot of testing, well, then we did go the other way in the range. But right now, we're not expecting that to be a very significant amount. And that's why we kept the range where it is. Yes, Ricky. So a couple of things. First of all, Our base business, as you say, is very strong. And it's strong across Diagnostics for Drug Development and frankly, each area of Drug Development. When you look at the diagnostics, we're seeing that people are coming back to the more routine health care. And if you look at the volume and you compare it to 2019, it's only down in the low single digits now versus if you look at the end of last year, it was in the mid- to upper single digits. So we've seen continued improvement in people coming back to the routine test.  The other thing that we're seeing is that for each blood draw, that there's more tests being run in that blood draw than historically happened. And the question is, will that be maintained? We are hypothesizing that some people have been out of health care for a while. So when they finally do go to their doctor or telemedicine, they're doing a lot of tests just to check on people's overall health, and therefore, that might not continue over time. But on the other hand, it may. And we're going to have to watch that closely in terms of how many tests per accession we see over time.  There's no doubt that the Diagnostic team is executing extraordinarily well in the marketplace. The team is focused. They're energized. They're doing a great job. They've worked through COVID. Our sales folks were out there the entire time doing whatever they could where doctors' offices were open, doing things remotely. One of our platforms for our key pillars of our strategy was digitalization. So we were able to do a lot of things digitally through the pandemic that historically we would not have been able to do. So I agree with your assessment that we're performing well in the marketplace versus others. Yes. No. So first of all, I'd say, if you look at the 3 pieces of our business, and I'll break them quite individually. If you look at our early-stage business, we have scale. And we're strong and we're a leader in that business, and it performs very well. If you look at our central laboratory business, we're a leader there as well. We have scale, we can compete. And I've said all along that we have the scale that we need in late-stage clinical trials. That's the area that as you get more trials, you can scale the quickest. And you can do that to some degree organically. You don't necessarily have to scale in clinical trials inorganically. So for example, we wanted to have more capabilities in China and Japan, we were able to build scale for clinical development in those countries fairly quickly. So we see what's happening in the marketplace. We understand the marketplace well. We understand the importance of scale. And to me, it's a certain level of scale you need to have and then you can be successful. And I believe we have the level of scale across each of our three businesses that we need. Yes. So Ricky, so we've seen all of the business come back, whether it be our base business or it'd be our esoteric business. In the first quarter, we saw a little bit more of the base business coming back. We think it was probably because people were getting physicals and the year was starting. It's typical to see that base business perform a bit better in the first quarter. Esoteric business continues to be pretty consistent because when people need to get one of those tests, they get it irrespective of the time of the year. So there's not a really significant difference versus what we would expect to see. Brian, when I look at the business, the pricing is always under some pressure, but it's pretty asymptotic. It doesn't tend to be significantly more pressure over time than not. And the pricing is pretty stable. I feel good about our volume. I feel good about our pricing as we go into the future. Obviously, PAMA right now, we're having our base case that there'll be an impact next year. And we expect that will be about the same as it was in 2019, around $100 million mark. But at the same time, we think that there's ways to get through that and be able to be successful through that. Yes. Thank you, Matt. So it's hard to predict where 2021 is going to end up. That's why we have such a broad range. It makes it even more difficult to predict 2022. What I would say is part of it is going to depend on how long the vaccines work for. Are we going to need a booster shot every year? Is it going to last for several years? Part of it is going to depend on how tough the flu seasons are. So there's still a lot of unknowns as we go to 2022. I mean I would expect there will still be testing for COVID in 2022 that we'll be doing. The level of which will be determined to some degree by the vaccines. But on the other hand, if the vaccines last a longer period of time, will we need to do more serology tests? Will we need to do more T cell testing? I think that the story is still going to be written as we learn more scientifically. And PCR testing will play a role, but serology and/or T cell, another test may play a very different role as we go into 2022 and beyond.  With regard to the testing capabilities that we've built, the machinery, we can still use a lot of that. I mean we use it for our other tests. There might be some excess capacity that has to be written off over time. But for us, it wouldn't be a significant issue where others that all they do is COVID testing and all they've done is build capacity for that, I think they'll have a significant issue. We're in very good shape there, frankly. Yes. So again, with the longer-term COA testing, it's early to understand exactly how that's going to play out. Part of it is going to depend on vaccines, but part of it will also depend on if we have good therapeutics. So for example, if we get to next year and it's a big flu season, And if somebody gets COVID, they still have a high likelihood of being hospitalized and/or dying from COVID. I think people are going to want to use a molecular PCR test and have it done by us. If there's great therapeutics and if people get COVID, they end up not being hospitalized and they can be managed from their home and it's more like the flu, then I think you might find more testing that's done in physicians' offices. So really, it's going to depend on how the science plays out. I assume there will be some testing needed in the long term that we'll be doing. But obviously, it will be significantly less over time than what we've done in the past.  To me, the real question continues to be, will there be a role for serology? Will we need to know if people are still immune to the disease or are vaccinated and have titers at the right level for the disease. And there might be other tests in the future that play a more important role than they do today, and we'll have to continue to watch that.  The last thing I'd say is with regard to capacity in the future, I've seen some countries that are going to use that capacity to do significantly more screening for things like HCV or HIV, things where molecular tests are done routinely today, but they're routinely done to diagnose versus the screen. So there might be some opportunities to do those types of things. But in general, as I said, molecular testing is a very small amount of the 530 million tests or so that we do every year. And therefore, for us, it's not going to be a significant issue. I feel very optimistic as I look at our base businesses moving forward. Yes. So some of the first thing I'll answer the last question first. We exited the quarter averaging around 80,000 tests per day. We averaged for the quarter about 113,000 tests per day. So you saw a continued decline.  With regard to geographical differences, weather was probably a bigger impact than other things. So when we saw the Northeast get hit by weather, there was a 2% impact. A lot of it came from where the weather was, obviously. In Texas, we saw a significant issue with what was occurring there at some point when electricity was out for a week. So it was more driven, I believe, by that than it was differences in other testing. Obviously, you're going to see some differences by geography as different parts of the country open up in different ways at different times. But frankly, you saw strength pretty much across all parts of the country when you compare it to where we were at the end of last year. Okay. So thank you, everybody, for joining us today.

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2021 full year guidance.  Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 47.4% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 45%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 32.9% and organic base business growth of 12.2%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.1 billion or 25.4% of revenue. There we go, operator. We can hear you. Okay. I think we've completed our formal remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Yes. No, we have seen over the past several quarters a little bit of a decline in the conversion rate. We're now at around 33%. And it's, as you know, relative to the mix of business that we're doing, more oncology work that we're seeing, good growth in our backlog, as Adam commented. So right now, we continue to have a lot of good momentum. Our orders continue to be very strong. We're building up a very strong backlog, again, at $14 billion. So nothing from our view long term would change. Obviously, in the first quarter especially, you'll see kind of a really strong growth rate in part because of the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic studies that we have that at some point will obviously start to taper off. Yes. Dan, it's Glenn. As you know, we do a book-to-bill on a trailing 12 number, and again, a record level of 1 4 7. So it's picked up nicely from the prior trailing 12 months. So obviously, it implies, obviously, a very good quarter. We tend not to give the quarterly numbers because we don't want it to be focused on the quarter. Obviously, this is done over the years, but it's fair to say that we feel we had a very good quarter, and it was enough to meaningfully bump up our trailing 12-month level. Yes. No, Dan, we've been really pleased with the pace of the recovery in Diagnostics, frankly, coming in a little stronger than what we would have expected, which, again, is one of the reasons we've increased the guidance that we have for Diagnostics. When you look at the breakup of the, call it, the 6% plus organic revenue growth, volumes are still down year-on-year. They were down around 1.3% but actually would have been favorable if you took out the negative impact from weather.  So we've really started to see the trend change. And when you think about it, not too surprising when you're comping now at the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the pandemic impact last year. But what we're equally pleased to see is that the volume levels continue to improve while still be down from 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Low single digits as well.  And so while revenue continues to be up year-on-year to '20, while revenues continue to be up compounded compared to '19, kind of a normalized year, volumes are still a little bit down. And our expectation continues to be that the volume levels will now start to kind of kick in above '19 levels, call it at the middle of the year. But the good news is that we -- while volumes are still a little bit soft compared to historical levels, we're making that up on our price/mix, which we're attributing more to the number of tests we're doing because we report volume on an accession basis. So maybe fewer visits to the physicians, but they're doing more tests for each of those visits, but good momentum that we're continuing to see. Yes. Kevin, to your point, what we've said in our guidance overall is that the free cash flow that we're going to generate this year, call it, the $1.8 billion to $2 billion, we expect to deploy between M&A and share repurchases. We tend to start off slower in the first quarter, just historically, even with our buyback program just to let the year a little bit unfold and see what the M&A opportunities are there. We continue, as Adam said, to have really a strong pipeline of M&A transactions. The reason why we said we were accelerating especially on the share repurchase side because we can obviously you unilaterally control that, is that with 1 quarter under our belt 3 to go, we still have that midpoint of 1.9 to fully deploy. So you would normally expect that instead of it just being done all towards the end of the year, you'll start to see a pickup. But we're encouraged with the pipeline of deals that we feel we can do. We're encouraged, obviously, that we'll continue to redeploy our capital with M&A. And from our perspective, we're on track with what we were expecting to see happen. Well, again, if you're -- one of the reasons, again, we've broken out the guidance between our underlying base business and the COVID testing is such that we can give various ranges for the 2. And clearly, there's a little bit more uncertainty visibility, if you will, on the level of PCR testing depending on what's going on with, obviously, the pandemic and how it impacts. So from our perspective, when we gave that range, we've said 2 things. That it's going to be a combination of different volume levels, but also potentially different levels of pricing. So right now, we obviously had a very strong first quarter relative to PCR volumes, 112,000 tests per day. But we ended the quarter at kind of the 80,000 test per day level. So you can see that we continue to see and expect that volume levels will continue to trail down. But again, we'll see if it picks up again, if you will. But at the midpoint, we're clearly considering that the volumes will come down.  And there's also pricing. With CMS, we've always held to the pricing on the reimbursement We continue to do that. At some point, that pricing may change. CMS may change their pricing reimbursement. So there's just a lot of variability. So at this point, we continue to do. We have all the capacity there. Our turnaround times are extremely strong. And so we're just meeting the needs that are out there. Again, there it's -- we guide to the revenue. Obviously, we've talked a little bit about kind of the leverage that we get on that volume for PCR depending upon the pricing. So we've talked about it being kind of north of our 65% incremental leverage on PCR volumes. Kind of comparable, but a little bit north of what we would normally have seen like on incremental volume from weather, if you will. So as Adam said, when we gave our guidance, we give a range. Obviously, the midpoint is kind of where the most expectations. But clearly, we could see our way to getting higher at the upper end and other things that could be headwinds on the lower end.  The reason we commented on the PCR one is that it's a little bit south of the center point is because, one, that's what we're currently seeing on the trends. But two, as Adam said, we could see it pick up again. So we were just trying to provide some color. And given where the extension of the public health emergency continues to go out, if it gets extended again, that could reinforce better pricing than what -- that would hold our pricing, which would be an improvement because we do assume in some of the scenarios we'll see lower pricing overall.  But when you look at our earnings, and it's kind of interesting, we obviously had a very solid first quarter and you compare it to, call it, the midpoint of the guidance that we give for earnings for the year, we had a much higher percentage of earnings than we would historically do. We tend to try to track not this precisely, but let's say, 1/4 of our earnings would normally be -- or 1 quarter, a quarter of the year. Here, we did around 40% of our earnings. And frankly, in the second quarter, I think it's fair to say It will be a strong quarter relative to the full year as well because we're still going to have another strong quarter of COVID testing, even though it will be less than what we saw in the first quarter.  From our standpoint, the bigger question will be the second half of the year, which was really where we do expect to see a decline in volumes and potentially a declining in pricing. But there's still that uncertainty out there that could potentially be upside if the volume levels hold up greater and the pricing holds up greater. But there's just a wide range of outcomes. Yes. The only thing, too, Brian, that I'd add is I agree that from a unit pricing standpoint, exactly as Adam has conveyed it. When we talk about price, we also do price mix. And so as you see that the volume levels are coming back, you'll see the price mix come down a little bit. Again, when you think about it and now those people are going to the physician's office more normally, you'll start to see a more normal cadence of how many tests per session they would have. So especially as we continue to grow, when we talk about a normal historical growth rate of kind of 2% to 3%, if you will, in, call it, the organic revenue with 1% to 2% coming from volume, one from price. So we normally always still do expect to have a contribution from favorable price mix. But given that the volume levels have been negative from year-over-year comparisons, we've seen an unusually high price/mix. So again, as we get more to normal, so you'll see both kind of fall back into where we would normally expect it to be."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chas Cook, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's fourth quarter 2022 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the proposed spinoff of the clinical development business, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiatives, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now, I'll turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today to discuss our fourth quarter results as well as the progress that we've made towards our strategy. 2022 ended strong for Labcorp with accelerated revenue growth in Diagnostics and continued strong underlying fundamentals in drug development. Drug development continued to have a tough year-over-year comparison, mostly due to less COVID-related work. In 2022, we took decisive actions to navigate a challenging operating environment. We advanced our strategy with the announcement of the planned spin of our clinical development business, and we closed several important hospital laboratory partnerships. I'll now discuss our fourth quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $4.14 and free cash flow was $536 million. The base business remains strong. On a constant currency basis, excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise base business revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter versus prior year. Growth in diagnostics-based business revenue in the fourth quarter was strong due to both routine and esoteric testing and revenue from the Ascension partnership. COVID PCR testing volumes declined during the quarter as expected, totaling 1.4 million tests performed and averaging 16,000 per day. Looking forward, our Diagnostic business will accelerate with 10.5% to 12.5% base business growth, benefiting by around 5 percentage points with a full year of our Ascension partnership. For Drug Development, fourth quarter base business revenue in constant currency declined 1% versus prior year. Early development and clinical development both grew but were offset by lower central laboratory revenue due mostly to COVID-related work. Drug Development ended the quarter with a strong trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.27. Looking forward, we expect the momentum to continue in drug development orders, and we expect that site enrollment in kids returns will continue to increase throughout the year. We also anticipate the drug development business to return to 5% to 7% growth with a stronger second half than first half due to early development and the annualization of an FSP contract loss. Finally, in the quarter, the Board authorized a $1 billion increase to the company's share repurchase program bringing our remaining total share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results and will review full year 2023 guidance in just a moment. Moving now to an update on the planned spin of our clinical development business. We have been pleased with the positive response from customers and employees, and we remain on track to complete the spin in mid-2023, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions. Recently, we unveiled Fortrea as the name of the clinical development business post spin. You can learn more by visiting fortrea.com. Also, in January, Tom Pipe joined Labcorp as President and CEO of our Clinical Development business. Tom will serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Fortrea, upon completion of the spin. Tom brings significant CRO experience, including serving as CEO of a public CRO. He has worked with many of our customers, and he knows the business well. We welcome Tom and look forward to working with him as we continue making progress towards the completion of the spin. Upon completion through a tax-free transaction, we will have 2 strong independent companies, Labcorp and Fortrea, which will emerge to the transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs to drive sustainable and profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. In the coming months, we plan to announce the Board of Directors of Fortrea, including the lead independent Director and other members of the executive leadership team. We also intend to host an Analyst Day in advance of the spin, and I look forward to working with Tom on timing. I'll now move to our enterprise strategy. We made significant advances on our strategy in 2022. We accelerated and closed several hospital and health system partnerships and acquisitions during the year. Most recently, we completed the integration of certain Ascension assets and operations. Labcorp now provides laboratory management services for nearly 100 hospitals across the Ascension hospital system. We are pleased with the smooth transition, and we want to thank our partners at Ascension for enabling our teams to help deliver the best patient care possible. In addition to Ascension, we entered strategic relationships with RWJBarnabas Health, AtlantiCare, Prisma Health and St. Dominic's during the year. The pipeline for hospital and local laboratory acquisition and investment is robust and will be a key area of opportunity for growth in 2023 and beyond. We also made progress in using digital technology and data to deliver better outcomes for patients. By significantly improving our web, mobile and digital channels, we've made it easier for customers to access critical data and health information. Using digital technology and artificial intelligence, we are reimagining our result reports to provide deeper insights, scientific expertise and clinical information to guide patient care. Additionally, we're encouraged by increased customer adoption of Labcorp's Diagnostic assistant, a tool that eclipse positions with the information they need to improve tariffs. Also, our investment in call center automization is improving the customer experience by enabling patients and providers to get answers faster through self-service features. Turning to oncology. We continue to expand our oncology capabilities to serve clinicians and drug development customers. In the fourth quarter, we launched a liquid biopsy test called Labcorp Plasma Focus. This test is used to match cancer patients with FDA-approved therapies using the patient's circulating tumor DNA taken from a blood draw. This is the first new product coming from Labcorp's acquisition of Personal Genome Diagnostics in 2022. Today, Labcorp offers customers and patients access to the most comprehensive oncology portfolio in the market. Our teams are evaluating and executing our growth opportunities in areas such as neurodegenerative, autoimmune and liver disease as well as cell and gene therapy and more. In 2022, our team supported over 5,000 clinical trials, work at over 90% of new FDA approvals and launched over 130 new tests. In the area of neurodegenerative disease, for example, we launched new tests to assist the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We anticipate more innovative launches in 2023. Finally, we made progress in our direct-to-consumer business. In 2022, we introduced Labcorp On-Demand, a platform aimed at providing consumers with easy and convenient access to our leading diagnostic tests. We now offer over 45 tests that cover over 100 biomarkers to help consumers monitor their health, stay current with wellness screening, plan for families and manage a broad range of chronic culturation. The progress we made this year is a direct result of the commitment of our employees who fuel our confidence in the outlook for 2023. We are recognized by Forbe's list of the world's best large employers in 2022, and we also earned the top score into 2022 Disability Equality Index. Attracting and retaining the best talent is key to our success, and we remain focused on being an employer of choice and destination for talent. As I look to 2023, I'm optimistic about the growth and strategic opportunities before us. Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2023 full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 9.4% compared to last year, due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency. This was partially offset by organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 79% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew 4.8% compared to the base business last year. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 4.7%, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. While the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition, the lab management agreement treated as organic growth. Operating income for the quarter was $91 million or 2.5% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $61 million of amortization and $88 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, LaunchPad initiatives and the proposed spin of Fortrea. In addition, the company recorded $270 million of goodwill and other asset impairment primarily related to the early development business, due to short-term labor and supply constraints. This impairment represents approximately 2% of Labcorp's goodwill and intangible assets. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $510 million or 13.9% of revenue compared to $902 million or 22.2% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. The benefit from LaunchPad savings and lower personnel expense were essentially offset by lower COVID-related demand and inflationary costs. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the 3-year period ending 2024. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 24.6% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the benefit from increased R&D tax credits and year-end true-ups for completed tax returns. We expect our 2023 full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $76 million or $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.14 in the quarter, down from $6.77 last year due to lower COVID testing earnings. Operating cash flow was $654 million in the quarter compared to $698 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower COVID test and earnings, partially offset by higher base business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million, down from $150 million last year. For the year, capital expenditures were 3.5% of base business revenue, and we expect that to continue into 2023. Free cash flow in the quarter was $536 million, bringing our full year free cash flow generation to $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we invested $150 million on acquisitions paid out $64 million in dividends and repurchased $300 million of stock, representing approximately 1.4 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $532 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board recently approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases, taking our total available authorization to approximately $1.5 billion. For the full year, we invested $1.2 billion on acquisitions, paid out $195 million in dividends and repurchased $1.1 billion of stock. We continue to have a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities that will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our shares are undervalued and that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. At year-end, we had $430 million in cash, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 1.9x gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Excluding COVID testing earnings, our leverage was around 2.5x, in line with our targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 12.8% compared to last year, primarily due to organic revenue being down 14.3%, which was due to COVID testing, partially offset by acquisitions of 1.7%. COVID testing revenue was down 79% compared to COVID testing last year while the base business grew organically by 8.6% compared to the base business last year. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth while the negative impact of weather and fewer revenue days constrained growth by approximately 1.2%. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 6.9%. Total volume decreased 11.8% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 13.8%, primarily offset by acquisition volume of 2%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 3% compared to base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.4% but was constrained by unfavorable impact from weather and fewer revenue days of approximately 1.2%. Price/mix decreased 1% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 6.4%, currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%, partially offset by base business growth of 5.9%. Base business price/mix was up 7.6% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $387 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $776 million or 29.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as the COVID margin was approximately 50% for the quarter, down from approximately 70% last year. We expect the COVID margin to be approximately 50% through the duration of the public health emergency, at which point we would expect the margin to decline but still be above the segment average. Base business margin was down approximately 30 basis points due to the impact from Ascension, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Excluding Ascension, margin would have been up approximately 50 basis points. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4.1% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign currency of 3.1%. Organic base business revenues declined 1.4% compared to last year, due to the negative impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these impacts, organic base business revenue grew 3.7%. The central ad business continued to be the most constrained by these impacts. Central ad-based business revenues were down 11.5%. However, excluding these impacts, organic constant currency revenue was up 4.7% and -- while on a comparable basis, early development was up 3.4% and clinical development was up 3.2%. Reported fourth quarter Drug Development revenues on a compound annual basis grew 5.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $209 million or 15% of revenue compared to $206 million or 14.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to LaunchPad savings and lower personnel costs, partially offset by lower COVID-related demand, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and inflationary costs. We ended the quarter with backlog of $16.3 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2022, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Also, our guidance assumes that Fortrea will be part of Labcorp for the full year. Upon its spin currently anticipated in the middle of the year, we expect to provide updated guidance. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1% to 4% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 8.5% to 10.5% and while COVID testing is expected to decline 75% to 90%. This assumes a PCR volume range of 5,000 to 12,000 tests per day on average for the year. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be down 2% to up 1.5% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 10.5% to 12.5%, which has approximately 5% growth due to Ascension. At the midpoint of our base business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 6.4%, including the benefit from Ascension of approximately 2%. We expect Diagnostics base business margin to be slightly up in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 5% to 7% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 20 basis points. At the midpoint of our guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 7.2%, primarily due to organic growth. While we have increased the number of NHP vendors with multiyear agreements to secure supply, lead times are projected to negatively impact drug development revenue between $80 million to $100 million early in the year. As a result, we expect drug development first quarter revenue growth to be lower than the average for the year. We also expect drug development margin to increase in 2023 compared to 2022, with the first quarter coming in comparable to the first quarter of 2022 due to the early development supply constraint. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16 to $18 compared to $19.94 in 2022. Adjusted EPS is expected to be lower compared to 2022 due to COVID testing while base business adjusted EPS at the midpoint of guidance implies approximately 13% growth. Free cash flow guidance is $1 billion to $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2022. The decline in cash flow was due to lower COVID testing. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business. While COVID testing volumes are expected to continue to decline through the year, we expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: There's a lot to unpack here. I guess I'll start with a couple. Is there any cost being built into the business right now ahead of the spin? I don't want to say the stranded costs or IT costs, but there's a couple of line items. It looks like corporate has been higher. The intersegment eliminations are -- seem to be a lot higher as well. I'm just trying to understand what's driving that, and if there's any investment being made there, that would show up there in a way that we can't necessarily see? And then secondly, I guess, -- this is such a wide range of earnings. Can you tell us, is it all just based on COVID? Is it based on the spin timing? It's unusual to have such a wide range. And I'm wondering what would be sort of low end versus high end, what would be driving that?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Kevin, and I'll take the second question first. I'll ask Glenn to provide some impact on the -- your first question. So the range that we gave is $16 to $18, a midpoint of $17. And we kind of focus and targeting on that midpoint. But there are things, particularly around COVID, that could still happen where we've given a pretty broad range of COVID coming down between 75% and 90% is still very difficult to predict that. The second thing is we gave a range for NHP of $80 million to $100 million. Good news is we've started to receive supply, and we started to receive shipments, but it's still early as we get those shipments in and it takes time to get the steady starts up. And then the third thing I would say is, while we're waiting for supply, we're still hiring people. As you recall, last quarter, we noted that in early development, we needed to hire more people. So I'm not slowing down the hiring process, while waiting for some of the supply shipments that we have. So we're going to hire people while we can't yet run some of those trials. So those are some of the pushes and pulls, but I would focus on the midpoint more so than the lower end of the range, I think, is highly unlikely.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, just to follow-up on that. When you look at the guidance ranges for both of our base businesses, we keep those rates within, call it, 2 percentage points. And it's really the COVID given the volatility in COVID, we provide a wider range, which causes that overall EPS number to be a little bit wider. Kevin, when you talk about the spin costs, you'll see that we treat that as kind of an unusual item. Obviously, we're going through a spin. These are onetime costs. You'll see that in the reconciliation between, call it, our GAAP and our adjusted earnings, you'll see in the footnotes that we incurred around $29 million of cost during the quarter related to the spin. So again, those would be backed out of our adjusted numbers when you look at our enterprise and segment performance.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. Can I ask a quick follow-up just on PAMA, the benefit you saw from PAMA and also the change in the code that occurred in December. That was obviously a positive benefit to the company. Did you reinvest those dollars? Or is all of that sort of you're letting that fall to the bottom line? How should we think about that in terms of the way you accounted for it or thought about it?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So again, when we gave our range, we're -- 2 things. One, for diagnostic business, 10.5% to 12.5% growth, I think is pretty extraordinary. But if you look at PAMA, we've included when we talk about margins, that we expect margins to be slightly to improve even with the impact of Ascension. And if you just look at fourth quarter, for example, our margins were down 30 basis points. Ascension was a negative 80 basis point hit. So you can see the impact from Ascension -- for us to be able to offset that impact on margins, it's due to the lack of PAMA being implemented this year as well as some of the benefits from the draw fees.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: My question is on just commercial payer negotiations. We're coming up on the 5-year anniversary of UnitedHealth announcement. I don't know if you want to address that directly, your national payers kind of broadly speaking, but are there any notable shifts you're seeing in the structure of your contracts? And just how do you feel about the ability to maintain price?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So obviously, we work with the payers all the time. Whether it's a year we have a negotiation with them or not. We're constantly in contact and working very closely with them. And we've seen continued pressure over the last 5 years, and I think that pressure will continue, but it's not accelerating. It's kind of very steady. And where we can get price concessions, we do -- but in general, I would say that there's continued pressure, but no different than what we've seen in the past.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Jack, just to add on that, too, is that when we think about price/mix, we've always talked about unit pricing being a headwind, but the favorability of our mix of esoteric growing faster than routine or test per Ascension. And so when you look at the growth rate that we have in vision for '23 in our guidance, it assumes both -- and mostly by favorable volume appreciation but also favorable price/mix even with unit pricing headwinds.\nJack Meehan: Got it. And I heard your commentary, Glenn, on some of the revenue pacing to start here. So a finer point you can draw on EPS, just either expectations, percentage of the full year or -- just any color to help on that would be great.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. It's interesting. If you go back and look to even pre-pandemic levels, 2023, even though we have some pluses and minuses, the trend in the earnings would come in similar. So I think that will give you roughly a good approximation. Interestingly enough, plus or minus, it comes in fairly quarter each time, but you'll see it's a little bit different in the first quarter, a little bit lower, a little bit higher throughout the rest of the year, but I think it will give you a good proxy.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Could you give us a little bit more of a breakdown of what you're seeing across the different subsegments at Covance, the central lab business in terms of volume trends, RFP flow at the clinical level. And then on the early development side, what's your level also of commitment to early development business as you kind of retain that as part of your spin process here?\nAdam Schechter: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I'll start with drug development and performance. What you saw for the fourth quarter was early development grew 5% on a constant currency basis. And I always give the CAGR as well from 2019 because that's before all the COVID-related work, it was about 6% CAGR from fourth quarter of 2019. If you look at the clinical business, we saw about 2.5% growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis. If you compare that to the fourth quarter CAGR of 2019, it was about 5%, but both of those were offset by a 9% decline in the central laboratory business versus prior year. That's, again, constant currency. But if you look at the business for the central laboratory on a CAGR basis in 2019, it actually grew about 5%. So it sums you that, that business remains healthy. It's just as you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we were doing a huge amount of -- for boosters for vaccines because that was right when the Omicron variant hit. So that's why you see such a tough year-over-year comparison for the central laboratory business. As I look at RFPs across the segments, meaning I look at them in total, the RFPs remain very strong and very consistent. So we haven't seen a change. As I look through last year on cancellation rates, I haven't seen a change. The cancellation rates remain low. They're up a little bit from 1 quarter down a little bit in the next quarter, but relatively flat and remain very low. And then to me, the most important thing is the book-to-bill. And as you see, the book-to-bill was very strong. It was a 1.27. And if you were to look at each of the individual segments for the quarter, although we don't typically give individual segment book-to-bill, you would see that they are all above the 1.2. So we feel good about each of the segments about the book-to-bill as we move forward. In terms of -- I'm sorry, go ahead, I'll answer the second question after you follow-up.\nErin Wright: Oh, no, go ahead. Go ahead.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. And then in terms of -- if you look at the ED business, we think it's a good business. It's a global business. We're looking to bring our innovative diagnostic test globally, and we think that they'll be able to help us do that with their global laboratory footprint. So we remain committed to that business, and we think it's a good business.\nErin Wright: And I guess, just my follow-up, as you prepare for the spin, how we should be thinking about the priorities around capital deployment, the M&A pipeline as well as buybacks and how we should be thinking about that?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So we're -- after the spin, which we are on track for the middle of this year, we will continue to provide a dividend. We expect to get dividends approved moving forward for Labcorp. And then we would continue to look to do these hospitals and local laboratory deals, of which our pipeline is very full. And there's a significant number of those that we're looking at evaluating it, we will win some of those this year. And then we believe our shares are still significantly undervalued. So we have now $1.5 billion of authorization for share repurchases, and we'll use those as appropriate.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Daley of Wells Fargo.\nTim Daley: Great. On the first one, I'm not trying to step on Tom's toes or anything here, but just isolating the drug development assets that will stay part of RemainCo. Could you just give us some color directionally as live magnitude, anything here on the EBITDA margins for early development in central lab, just how they looked at '22, not trying to ask for stranded cost adjustments or anything like that?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Tim, this is Glenn. As you know, we break out the 2 segments and then with that, revenue, OI and margins. So for drug development, we provide that. We haven't broken out the pieces, if you will, because, again, of all the interrelationships and shared services and so forth. So part of the issue of doing the spin, obviously is now we're standing an independent company with where we have a lot of direct costs, but then we also have a lot of indirect costs. And we're working through, obviously, all those costs and including transition services that we would be providing for a period of time. So we're currently in the process of getting all the numbers done once we're complete with that, we'll obviously be sharing kind of the spinco view, both on the top line and the bottom line at the appropriate time, including in an anticipated investor Analyst Day, if you will, prior to the spin. And obviously, to the extent we have those financials done prior to that, we can also share them. But at this point, we've talked in the past about here's the segment average and that the businesses are for the plus or minus in line before you get to those independent standup costs.\nTim Daley: All right. Appreciate it. I thought I'd give it a shot. And then secondly, on the -- just sitting here on the early development business, so if we were to exclude the $80 million to $100 million NHP headwind you guys are baking into the guidance would be growing in FY '23? And what's the price assumption embedded in there for the year?\nAdam Schechter: So the short answer is yes, it would be growing for the year with the $80 million to $100 million in there, growing nicely. And what was your second question, the...\nTim Daley: The pricing assumption embedded in the EB business for '23?\nAdam Schechter: In terms of the pricing -- so first thing I'd say is that we expect the priming pricing to go up significantly because of the supply issues. And I think, therefore, there you would expect to have better pricing overall. Yes. And just to be clear, that pricing, especially primary that does get passed on to customers -- so it doesn't impact our margins and -- it affects the margins because we don't get a margin on that, but the pricing can be passed on to the customers.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today to discuss our fourth quarter results as well as the progress that we've made towards our strategy. 2022 ended strong for Labcorp with accelerated revenue growth in Diagnostics and continued strong underlying fundamentals in drug development. Drug development continued to have a tough year-over-year comparison, mostly due to less COVID-related work. In 2022, we took decisive actions to navigate a challenging operating environment. We advanced our strategy with the announcement of the planned spin of our clinical development business, and we closed several important hospital laboratory partnerships. I'll now discuss our fourth quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $4.14 and free cash flow was $536 million. The base business remains strong. On a constant currency basis, excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise base business revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter versus prior year. Growth in diagnostics-based business revenue in the fourth quarter was strong due to both routine and esoteric testing and revenue from the Ascension partnership. COVID PCR testing volumes declined during the quarter as expected, totaling 1.4 million tests performed and averaging 16,000 per day. Looking forward, our Diagnostic business will accelerate with 10.5% to 12.5% base business growth, benefiting by around 5 percentage points with a full year of our Ascension partnership. For Drug Development, fourth quarter base business revenue in constant currency declined 1% versus prior year. Early development and clinical development both grew but were offset by lower central laboratory revenue due mostly to COVID-related work. Drug Development ended the quarter with a strong trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.27. Looking forward, we expect the momentum to continue in drug development orders, and we expect that site enrollment in kids returns will continue to increase throughout the year. We also anticipate the drug development business to return to 5% to 7% growth with a stronger second half than first half due to early development and the annualization of an FSP contract loss. Finally, in the quarter, the Board authorized a $1 billion increase to the company's share repurchase program bringing our remaining total share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results and will review full year 2023 guidance in just a moment. Moving now to an update on the planned spin of our clinical development business. We have been pleased with the positive response from customers and employees, and we remain on track to complete the spin in mid-2023, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions. Recently, we unveiled Fortrea as the name of the clinical development business post spin. You can learn more by visiting fortrea.com. Also, in January, Tom Pipe joined Labcorp as President and CEO of our Clinical Development business. Tom will serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Fortrea, upon completion of the spin. Tom brings significant CRO experience, including serving as CEO of a public CRO. He has worked with many of our customers, and he knows the business well. We welcome Tom and look forward to working with him as we continue making progress towards the completion of the spin. Upon completion through a tax-free transaction, we will have 2 strong independent companies, Labcorp and Fortrea, which will emerge to the transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs to drive sustainable and profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. In the coming months, we plan to announce the Board of Directors of Fortrea, including the lead independent Director and other members of the executive leadership team. We also intend to host an Analyst Day in advance of the spin, and I look forward to working with Tom on timing. I'll now move to our enterprise strategy. We made significant advances on our strategy in 2022. We accelerated and closed several hospital and health system partnerships and acquisitions during the year. Most recently, we completed the integration of certain Ascension assets and operations. Labcorp now provides laboratory management services for nearly 100 hospitals across the Ascension hospital system. We are pleased with the smooth transition, and we want to thank our partners at Ascension for enabling our teams to help deliver the best patient care possible. In addition to Ascension, we entered strategic relationships with RWJBarnabas Health, AtlantiCare, Prisma Health and St. Dominic's during the year. The pipeline for hospital and local laboratory acquisition and investment is robust and will be a key area of opportunity for growth in 2023 and beyond. We also made progress in using digital technology and data to deliver better outcomes for patients. By significantly improving our web, mobile and digital channels, we've made it easier for customers to access critical data and health information. Using digital technology and artificial intelligence, we are reimagining our result reports to provide deeper insights, scientific expertise and clinical information to guide patient care. Additionally, we're encouraged by increased customer adoption of Labcorp's Diagnostic assistant, a tool that eclipse positions with the information they need to improve tariffs. Also, our investment in call center automization is improving the customer experience by enabling patients and providers to get answers faster through self-service features. Turning to oncology. We continue to expand our oncology capabilities to serve clinicians and drug development customers. In the fourth quarter, we launched a liquid biopsy test called Labcorp Plasma Focus. This test is used to match cancer patients with FDA-approved therapies using the patient's circulating tumor DNA taken from a blood draw. This is the first new product coming from Labcorp's acquisition of Personal Genome Diagnostics in 2022. Today, Labcorp offers customers and patients access to the most comprehensive oncology portfolio in the market. Our teams are evaluating and executing our growth opportunities in areas such as neurodegenerative, autoimmune and liver disease as well as cell and gene therapy and more. In 2022, our team supported over 5,000 clinical trials, work at over 90% of new FDA approvals and launched over 130 new tests. In the area of neurodegenerative disease, for example, we launched new tests to assist the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We anticipate more innovative launches in 2023. Finally, we made progress in our direct-to-consumer business. In 2022, we introduced Labcorp On-Demand, a platform aimed at providing consumers with easy and convenient access to our leading diagnostic tests. We now offer over 45 tests that cover over 100 biomarkers to help consumers monitor their health, stay current with wellness screening, plan for families and manage a broad range of chronic culturation. The progress we made this year is a direct result of the commitment of our employees who fuel our confidence in the outlook for 2023. We are recognized by Forbe's list of the world's best large employers in 2022, and we also earned the top score into 2022 Disability Equality Index. Attracting and retaining the best talent is key to our success, and we remain focused on being an employer of choice and destination for talent. As I look to 2023, I'm optimistic about the growth and strategic opportunities before us. Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned for the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Yes. Kevin, and I'll take the second question first. I'll ask Glenn to provide some impact on the -- your first question. So the range that we gave is $16 to $18, a midpoint of $17. And we kind of focus and targeting on that midpoint. But there are things, particularly around COVID, that could still happen where we've given a pretty broad range of COVID coming down between 75% and 90% is still very difficult to predict that. The second thing is we gave a range for NHP of $80 million to $100 million. Good news is we've started to receive supply, and we started to receive shipments, but it's still early as we get those shipments in and it takes time to get the steady starts up. And then the third thing I would say is, while we're waiting for supply, we're still hiring people. As you recall, last quarter, we noted that in early development, we needed to hire more people. So I'm not slowing down the hiring process, while waiting for some of the supply shipments that we have. So we're going to hire people while we can't yet run some of those trials. So those are some of the pushes and pulls, but I would focus on the midpoint more so than the lower end of the range, I think, is highly unlikely. Yes. So again, when we gave our range, we're -- 2 things. One, for diagnostic business, 10.5% to 12.5% growth, I think is pretty extraordinary. But if you look at PAMA, we've included when we talk about margins, that we expect margins to be slightly to improve even with the impact of Ascension. And if you just look at fourth quarter, for example, our margins were down 30 basis points. Ascension was a negative 80 basis point hit. So you can see the impact from Ascension -- for us to be able to offset that impact on margins, it's due to the lack of PAMA being implemented this year as well as some of the benefits from the draw fees. Yes. So obviously, we work with the payers all the time. Whether it's a year we have a negotiation with them or not. We're constantly in contact and working very closely with them. And we've seen continued pressure over the last 5 years, and I think that pressure will continue, but it's not accelerating. It's kind of very steady. And where we can get price concessions, we do -- but in general, I would say that there's continued pressure, but no different than what we've seen in the past. Sure. Thanks for the question. So I'll start with drug development and performance. What you saw for the fourth quarter was early development grew 5% on a constant currency basis. And I always give the CAGR as well from 2019 because that's before all the COVID-related work, it was about 6% CAGR from fourth quarter of 2019. If you look at the clinical business, we saw about 2.5% growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis. If you compare that to the fourth quarter CAGR of 2019, it was about 5%, but both of those were offset by a 9% decline in the central laboratory business versus prior year. That's, again, constant currency. But if you look at the business for the central laboratory on a CAGR basis in 2019, it actually grew about 5%. So it sums you that, that business remains healthy. It's just as you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we were doing a huge amount of -- for boosters for vaccines because that was right when the Omicron variant hit. So that's why you see such a tough year-over-year comparison for the central laboratory business. As I look at RFPs across the segments, meaning I look at them in total, the RFPs remain very strong and very consistent. So we haven't seen a change. As I look through last year on cancellation rates, I haven't seen a change. The cancellation rates remain low. They're up a little bit from 1 quarter down a little bit in the next quarter, but relatively flat and remain very low. And then to me, the most important thing is the book-to-bill. And as you see, the book-to-bill was very strong. It was a 1.27. And if you were to look at each of the individual segments for the quarter, although we don't typically give individual segment book-to-bill, you would see that they are all above the 1.2. So we feel good about each of the segments about the book-to-bill as we move forward. In terms of -- I'm sorry, go ahead, I'll answer the second question after you follow-up. Okay. And then in terms of -- if you look at the ED business, we think it's a good business. It's a global business. We're looking to bring our innovative diagnostic test globally, and we think that they'll be able to help us do that with their global laboratory footprint. So we remain committed to that business, and we think it's a good business. Yes. So we're -- after the spin, which we are on track for the middle of this year, we will continue to provide a dividend. We expect to get dividends approved moving forward for Labcorp. And then we would continue to look to do these hospitals and local laboratory deals, of which our pipeline is very full. And there's a significant number of those that we're looking at evaluating it, we will win some of those this year. And then we believe our shares are still significantly undervalued. So we have now $1.5 billion of authorization for share repurchases, and we'll use those as appropriate. So the short answer is yes, it would be growing for the year with the $80 million to $100 million in there, growing nicely. And what was your second question, the... In terms of the pricing -- so first thing I'd say is that we expect the priming pricing to go up significantly because of the supply issues. And I think, therefore, there you would expect to have better pricing overall. Yes. And just to be clear, that pricing, especially primary that does get passed on to customers -- so it doesn't impact our margins and -- it affects the margins because we don't get a margin on that, but the pricing can be passed on to the customers."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2023 full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 9.4% compared to last year, due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency. This was partially offset by organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 79% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew 4.8% compared to the base business last year. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 4.7%, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. While the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition, the lab management agreement treated as organic growth. Operating income for the quarter was $91 million or 2.5% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $61 million of amortization and $88 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, LaunchPad initiatives and the proposed spin of Fortrea. In addition, the company recorded $270 million of goodwill and other asset impairment primarily related to the early development business, due to short-term labor and supply constraints. This impairment represents approximately 2% of Labcorp's goodwill and intangible assets. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $510 million or 13.9% of revenue compared to $902 million or 22.2% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. The benefit from LaunchPad savings and lower personnel expense were essentially offset by lower COVID-related demand and inflationary costs. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the 3-year period ending 2024. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 24.6% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings as well as the benefit from increased R&D tax credits and year-end true-ups for completed tax returns. We expect our 2023 full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $76 million or $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.14 in the quarter, down from $6.77 last year due to lower COVID testing earnings. Operating cash flow was $654 million in the quarter compared to $698 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower COVID test and earnings, partially offset by higher base business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million, down from $150 million last year. For the year, capital expenditures were 3.5% of base business revenue, and we expect that to continue into 2023. Free cash flow in the quarter was $536 million, bringing our full year free cash flow generation to $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we invested $150 million on acquisitions paid out $64 million in dividends and repurchased $300 million of stock, representing approximately 1.4 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $532 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board recently approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases, taking our total available authorization to approximately $1.5 billion. For the full year, we invested $1.2 billion on acquisitions, paid out $195 million in dividends and repurchased $1.1 billion of stock. We continue to have a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities that will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our shares are undervalued and that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. At year-end, we had $430 million in cash, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 1.9x gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Excluding COVID testing earnings, our leverage was around 2.5x, in line with our targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 12.8% compared to last year, primarily due to organic revenue being down 14.3%, which was due to COVID testing, partially offset by acquisitions of 1.7%. COVID testing revenue was down 79% compared to COVID testing last year while the base business grew organically by 8.6% compared to the base business last year. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth while the negative impact of weather and fewer revenue days constrained growth by approximately 1.2%. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 6.9%. Total volume decreased 11.8% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 13.8%, primarily offset by acquisition volume of 2%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 3% compared to base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.4% but was constrained by unfavorable impact from weather and fewer revenue days of approximately 1.2%. Price/mix decreased 1% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 6.4%, currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%, partially offset by base business growth of 5.9%. Base business price/mix was up 7.6% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $387 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $776 million or 29.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as the COVID margin was approximately 50% for the quarter, down from approximately 70% last year. We expect the COVID margin to be approximately 50% through the duration of the public health emergency, at which point we would expect the margin to decline but still be above the segment average. Base business margin was down approximately 30 basis points due to the impact from Ascension, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Excluding Ascension, margin would have been up approximately 50 basis points. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4.1% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign currency of 3.1%. Organic base business revenues declined 1.4% compared to last year, due to the negative impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these impacts, organic base business revenue grew 3.7%. The central ad business continued to be the most constrained by these impacts. Central ad-based business revenues were down 11.5%. However, excluding these impacts, organic constant currency revenue was up 4.7% and -- while on a comparable basis, early development was up 3.4% and clinical development was up 3.2%. Reported fourth quarter Drug Development revenues on a compound annual basis grew 5.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $209 million or 15% of revenue compared to $206 million or 14.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to LaunchPad savings and lower personnel costs, partially offset by lower COVID-related demand, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and inflationary costs. We ended the quarter with backlog of $16.3 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2022, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Also, our guidance assumes that Fortrea will be part of Labcorp for the full year. Upon its spin currently anticipated in the middle of the year, we expect to provide updated guidance. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1% to 4% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 8.5% to 10.5% and while COVID testing is expected to decline 75% to 90%. This assumes a PCR volume range of 5,000 to 12,000 tests per day on average for the year. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be down 2% to up 1.5% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 10.5% to 12.5%, which has approximately 5% growth due to Ascension. At the midpoint of our base business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 6.4%, including the benefit from Ascension of approximately 2%. We expect Diagnostics base business margin to be slightly up in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 5% to 7% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 20 basis points. At the midpoint of our guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 7.2%, primarily due to organic growth. While we have increased the number of NHP vendors with multiyear agreements to secure supply, lead times are projected to negatively impact drug development revenue between $80 million to $100 million early in the year. As a result, we expect drug development first quarter revenue growth to be lower than the average for the year. We also expect drug development margin to increase in 2023 compared to 2022, with the first quarter coming in comparable to the first quarter of 2022 due to the early development supply constraint. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16 to $18 compared to $19.94 in 2022. Adjusted EPS is expected to be lower compared to 2022 due to COVID testing while base business adjusted EPS at the midpoint of guidance implies approximately 13% growth. Free cash flow guidance is $1 billion to $1.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2022. The decline in cash flow was due to lower COVID testing. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business. While COVID testing volumes are expected to continue to decline through the year, we expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. No, just to follow-up on that. When you look at the guidance ranges for both of our base businesses, we keep those rates within, call it, 2 percentage points. And it's really the COVID given the volatility in COVID, we provide a wider range, which causes that overall EPS number to be a little bit wider. Kevin, when you talk about the spin costs, you'll see that we treat that as kind of an unusual item. Obviously, we're going through a spin. These are onetime costs. You'll see that in the reconciliation between, call it, our GAAP and our adjusted earnings, you'll see in the footnotes that we incurred around $29 million of cost during the quarter related to the spin. So again, those would be backed out of our adjusted numbers when you look at our enterprise and segment performance. Jack, just to add on that, too, is that when we think about price/mix, we've always talked about unit pricing being a headwind, but the favorability of our mix of esoteric growing faster than routine or test per Ascension. And so when you look at the growth rate that we have in vision for '23 in our guidance, it assumes both -- and mostly by favorable volume appreciation but also favorable price/mix even with unit pricing headwinds. Yes. It's interesting. If you go back and look to even pre-pandemic levels, 2023, even though we have some pluses and minuses, the trend in the earnings would come in similar. So I think that will give you roughly a good approximation. Interestingly enough, plus or minus, it comes in fairly quarter each time, but you'll see it's a little bit different in the first quarter, a little bit lower, a little bit higher throughout the rest of the year, but I think it will give you a good proxy. Tim, this is Glenn. As you know, we break out the 2 segments and then with that, revenue, OI and margins. So for drug development, we provide that. We haven't broken out the pieces, if you will, because, again, of all the interrelationships and shared services and so forth. So part of the issue of doing the spin, obviously is now we're standing an independent company with where we have a lot of direct costs, but then we also have a lot of indirect costs. And we're working through, obviously, all those costs and including transition services that we would be providing for a period of time. So we're currently in the process of getting all the numbers done once we're complete with that, we'll obviously be sharing kind of the spinco view, both on the top line and the bottom line at the appropriate time, including in an anticipated investor Analyst Day, if you will, prior to the spin. And obviously, to the extent we have those financials done prior to that, we can also share them. But at this point, we've talked in the past about here's the segment average and that the businesses are for the plus or minus in line before you get to those independent standup costs."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chas Cook. Sir, please begin.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Labcorp's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2022 guidance and the related assumptions; the proposed spin-off of the Clinical Development business; the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions; future business strategies; expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions; and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss our progress and our performance in the third quarter. I'll start with a few high-level comments about the quarter, then provide a brief update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development business before turning to our quarterly results and progress against our strategy. Diagnostics performed very well with Base Business revenue growth of 3.7% over the last year and a 4% CAGR versus 2019. With Ascension in the fourth quarter, we expect full year revenue growth of 6% to 7%. Drug Development Base Business fundamentals remain strong. And our expected full year CAGR of almost 8% since 2019 is consistent with how we expect the business to perform. There are what we believe to be temporary issues that impacted our Drug Development performance in the quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail when outlining our results. Turning now to the spin of our Clinical Development business. We are off to a strong start since announcing the planned spin back in July. We were quick to establish a spin management office made up of dedicated people and external advisers with significant spin transaction experience.  In addition, working with advisers, we're in the process of identifying members of the executive team, the CEO and the Board of Directors of the new company. And finally, we are making good progress to finding their transition service agreements and preparing the audited financial statements. With the progress to date, we are targeting completion of the spin with an accelerated time frame of mid-2023, subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including those related to the tax-free nature of the separation and the SEC process. Upon completion, we will create 2 strong independent companies through a tax-free transaction. We are excited by the opportunities this spin represents for the Clinical Development business. The new company will have the enhanced strategic flexibility and operational focus to grow, invest, pursue its priorities and address market opportunities. Further, we believe both Labcorp and the new Clinical Development business will emerge from this transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs, drive sustainable and profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. We plan to provide more information on our progress, including key leadership appointments, in the coming months. I'll now turn to third quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $4.68, and free cash flow was $270 million. Base Business organic revenue for the enterprise, excluding COVID testing revenue, is up 1.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This demonstrates the strength of our underlying business, particularly in Diagnostics, in a very challenging operating environment marked by rising labor costs, labor shortages and other inflationary pressures. In Diagnostics, Base Business revenue increased about 4% year-over-year due to an uptick in demand in both routine and esoteric testing. We continue to see momentum in our hospital system business. And later, I'll give an update on the Ascension integration, which is off to a very good start. In Drug Development, quarterly Base Business revenue in constant currency is flat versus the prior year. This is driven by a tough year-over-year comparison with less COVID-related work and the impact from the conflict in Ukraine. In central laboratories, there were timing-related challenges when looking at kits out, those that we sent to investigator sites; and kits returned, those that investigators sent back to us to be analyzed. We believe investigators ordered significantly more kits than normal in the third quarter last year to overcome supply issues. This was in addition to the kits for COVID trials. The pace of investigators returning kits has not rebounded as quickly as we expected. We believe this is largely due to COVID-related impacts and the macro environment, and that will return to normal levels over time. Both demand and orders in central laboratories continue to be very strong. In early development, we have strong demand for trial work as well as adequate capacity. However, the impact from our business was due to labor constraints. We are hiring as fast as we can. But like in many parts of the economy, finding labor has been difficult. Drug Development Base Business margins for the quarter were 15%, an expansion from last quarter but lower than anticipated due to the revenue in central laboratories and labor shortages in early development. We continue to see a healthy order flow and backlog in Drug Development, and the segment ended the quarter with a 1.25 trailing 12-month book-to-bill. Across Diagnostics and Drug Development, our margins were negatively impacted by rising labor costs and other inflationary pressures. We are taking cost actions, and we're focused on improving margins. In addition, LaunchPad savings continue to help offset the impact of near and expected midterm headwinds. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results in just a moment. COVID PCR testing volumes continued to decline during the quarter, totaling 2.2 million tests performed and averaging 24,000 per day. As we enter the winter amid concerns about rising COVID, flu and RSV cases, we're maintaining adequate supply and capacity to accommodate current and future testing needs. Also, our scientists stand ready to respond as new variants arise. I'll now move to our enterprise strategy against which we're executing well by harnessing science, innovation and technology and capitalizing on key opportunities to help us deliver for all stakeholders. Earlier this month, we announced the completion of transactions that established our comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension. Our strategic collaboration includes an agreement for Labcorp to manage hospital labs in 10 states and to acquire certain lab assets. At its core, the collaboration expands access to Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities and laboratory services for communities served by Ascension. I'm pleased to report that the transition and the integration are going well, and we are now performing thousands of tests across the health system. This was a big undertaking, and I'd like to thank employees and leadership from Ascension and Labcorp who make the changeover as seamless as possible. In addition to the Ascension agreement, we're focused on accelerating our hospital and health systems business. We completed our acquisition of the outreach lab business and related assets of New Jersey-based RWJBarnabas Health during the quarter, and that integration is also progressing well. Our hospital and local lab acquisition and investment pipeline is very robust, and we see major opportunity now through 2023. Turning to oncology. We're furthering our position as a leader in this space through the addition of new testing and screening capabilities. We continue to see benefits from the Personal Genome Diagnostics, an omni portfolios, including their leading liquid biopsy, tissue-based diagnostics and kitting solutions. We have the broadest portfolio and capabilities in oncology diagnostics today, and we are well positioned for growth. We are also pursuing relationships that accelerate our growth and enhance our portfolio. This quarter, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. We also entered a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases. In addition to our progress in oncology, Labcorp is relentlessly focused on innovating and delivering our customers valuable solutions across all areas to help them achieve their goals. We enhanced our neurology offering in the quarter through the launch of a pan-neoplastic and other neuro autoimmune panels, Together with our previously announced test for brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, these panels round out our portfolio and give us a leadership position in neuro biomarkers to support customers. The company has seen growing demand for our at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand, and our consumer product pipeline is strong. Our FDA authorization, combination COVID, flu, RSV at-home collection test continues to be important with the rise of respiratory virus cases expected this fall and through the winter. Lastly, Labcorp's commitment to its employees continues to be recognized. We recently were named by the Forbes to its list of World's Best Employers, and we also earned a top score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index. In summary, our base business fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned to deliver sustained long-term value and growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.6 billion, a decrease of 11.2% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency translation. This was partially offset by organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 70% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 0.7% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 1.4%. Operating income for the quarter was $469 million or 13% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $65 million of amortization and $54 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, the proposed spin of the Clinical Development business, facility rationalization and other LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, the adjusted operating income in the quarter was $589 million or 16.3% of revenue compared to $907 million or 22.3% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing and the impact from acquisitions. The benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings were essentially offset by higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs. The tax rate for the quarter was 16.2%. The adjusted tax rate was 22.8% compared to 24.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to benefits from increased R&D tax credits. We now expect our annual adjusted tax rate going forward to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $353 million or $3.90 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.68 in the quarter compared to $6.82 last year. Operating cash flow was $374 million in the quarter compared to $767 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to lower cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $104 million, down from $118 million last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of Base Business revenue. Free cash flow was $270 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested $459 million on acquisitions, paid out $65 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of stock, representing 1.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had over $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to believe that our shares are undervalued, and our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. At quarter end, we had $400 million in cash, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 1.7x gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Excluding COVID testing earnings, our leverage was 2.5x, in line with our targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 15.7% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 16.4%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.9%. COVID testing revenue was down 70% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 3.7% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.3%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 10.3% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 10.9%, partially offset by acquisition of 0.6%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing as Base Business volume grew 3.1% compared to the Base Business last year. Price/mix decreased 5.4% versus last year, primarily due to an organic decline of 5.5%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.3%. The lower organic price/mix was due to COVID testing. Base Business price/mix was up 0.6% compared to Base Business last year, benefiting from higher esoteric test mix. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $440 million or 19.9% of revenue compared to $775 million or 29.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as lower COVID volumes caused margins to decline to approximately 50% for the quarter. We expect this margin level to continue through the rest of the year, which would put full year margin at approximately 60%. Base Business margins were flat versus last year as organic growth and LaunchPad savings were offset by higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 3.7% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign exchange translation of minus 3.4%. While acquisitions contributed 0.5% of growth, organic Base Business revenues declined 0.7% compared to last year due to the negative impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenue grew 3.8%. The central lab business continues to be the most impacted by lower COVID-related revenues and the impact from Ukraine-Russia crisis. Central lab Base Business revenues were down 9.8%. However, excluding these items, organic constant currency revenue was up 4.1%. While on a comparable basis, early development was up 8.6% and Clinical Development was up 2.3%. In addition, Clinical Development was impacted by the loss of an FSP contract outside the U.S. earlier this year, affecting third and fourth quarter revenue growth. However, recent wins, including a large Phase IV market access program, will support a return to higher growth in 2023. Reported Drug Development revenues grew 3 -- or 6.1% on a compounded annual basis compared to 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $211 million or 15% of revenue compared to $226 million or 15.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to the reduction of COVID-related work in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these issues, margins would have been up approximately 100 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by inflationary costs and the negative mix impact from acquisitions. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 6% to 7.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 275 basis points, primarily due to the slower pace of central lab kits shipped and kits received, early development labor constraints, lower COVID testing, the delay in the Ascension transaction and currency. This guidance now includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 3% to 4%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 57% to 59%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 10% to 11.5% compared to 2021. This guidance reflects a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint as the benefit from Ascension will be mostly offset by lower COVID testing demand. Diagnostics Base Business revenue is expected to grow 6% to 7%, an increase of 150 basis points at our midpoint due to Ascension now being reflected in the segment outlook, while it was in our enterprise guidance prior to closing the transaction. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 5%. Note that Ascension will be dilutive to Diagnostics AOI margin of approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, but we expect margins to improve going forward as they are fully integrated. COVID testing is now expected to decline 57% to 59%. We expect PCR volume to be between 15,000 to 20,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We are currently tracking at approximately 15,000 PCR tests per day. We expect Drug Development revenue to decline 1.5% to 2.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 450 basis points, primarily due to the slower pace of kits shipped and kits received in central labs, labor constraints in early development and further currency translation headwinds. We expect the Base Business to decline 1% to 2% compared to 2021. Foreign currency translation negatively impacts our growth rate by 280 basis points. In addition, the growth rate is constrained by lower COVID-related work in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 7.7%. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $19.25 to $20.25, a narrowing of our prior guidance range of $19 to $21.25. At the midpoint, our guidance is lower by $0.38 due to lower COVID testing. In the Base Business, the decreased revenue outlook for Drug Development is being offset by additional cost control measures and the low effective tax rate. Free cash flow guidance is now $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion, down from our prior guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. The decline in the cash outlook is due to lower projected cash earnings and higher working capital requirements. The lower cash earnings include the expected decrease in adjusted net earnings, the proposed spin and acquisition-related costs as well as the timing of cash tax payments. The higher working capital requirements, which are timing-related, primarily relates to Drug Development receivable collections as the company continues to work to improve days sales outstanding. Said differently, DSOs remained flat over the past quarter, but our guidance had assumed improvement in the second half of the year. In summary, our Diagnostics business continued to perform well, while our Drug Development business fundamentals remain strong in a challenging environment. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the fourth quarter, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline from the third quarter. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we'll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Adam, wanted to dig into the Drug Development business. Just could you talk about what's changed in terms of the business trends since the second quarter? Labor and shortages has come up a lot in the discussion. Just talk about -- I don't know if there's a way to quantify, or some metric around the level of pressure you're seeing today versus back in July. And then, Glenn, you called out an FSP cancellation. Just when did that take place? Is there any color you can give around the size of that?\nAdam Schechter: Jack, I'll go first. So first of all, if you look at Drug Development overall and you look at our new guidance at the midpoint, the full year growth would represent 7.7%, almost 8%, CAGR since it's 2019. So that's about what you would expect for the business. But what's changed, frankly, is that we're seeing a larger-than-expected impact from kits in central laboratory. That's the most significant change. What happened last year was investigators ordered more kits than they typically would because there were some supply issues. So for example, butterfly needles were in short supply for a period of time. Some of the test tubes that we need that go in those kits were in short supply. And typically, when an investigator order a kit, we'd be able to get it to them in 2 or 3 days. With the supply issues, sometimes it was taking quite a bit longer than that. So once we had supply of kits, the investigators were ordering many more than what they actually needed. It was only like hoarding of the kits. That's very difficult to track, it's very difficult to know exactly how many they're using at any period of time versus the number of kits that they have. At the same time, we were sending out a lot of kits because of the COVID trials. And the COVID trial kits were coming back to us very quickly because they were enrolling very fast. We were sending them out some massive numbers of investigators because everybody was focused on those COVID trials. So it kind of masked the return rates of the kits for non-COVID-related trials. As we sit here today, what we're seeing is the kits going out in the third quarter of this year were about 30% lower the number of kits that we sent out in the third quarter of last year. So it's pretty significant. And we get paid for each kit that goes out. But even more significant, the number of kits coming back to us are not at 2019 levels yet. And we actually make most of our money on the kits that come back to us because that's when we perform all of the tests on the samples that come back to us. Now we believe that's temporary. We think it's -- sometimes when there's COVID issues like in Europe and so forth, it slows down the kits coming back. There could be some labor issues at the sites that are slowing down the kits coming back to us. The kits will come back to us. The trials will enroll. So we think it's a temporary timing issue. The reason we didn't flag it before now is when we looked at the beginning of the summer, the kits coming back to us were actually starting to increase. So we felt like they would continue to increase. Unfortunately, they leveled off very quickly and they've not increased again since that time. So again, we believe it's temporary, and we're working on it. But it's certainly something that's new based on what we've seen in third quarter, and we've expected that to continue in our guidance in fourth quarter. At the same time, the other issue we have is just labor. I mean finding labor is hard right now, particularly for frontline and other important personnel that you need in your laboratories. And it's not only hard to find them, but once you find them, training for something in the laboratory takes a lot longer than most other workers. And it takes them a while before they become fully productive. So when you look at our early development business, that business looks great in terms of orders, in terms of our capacity, in terms of RFPs. The issue that we're facing there is we just can't get all the studies up and running as fast as we'd like because we're needing more personnel. And we're doing everything we can. If you look at Madison, Wisconsin, we have a large lab. We actually have buses wrapped in Labcorp talking about come to one of our career centers because we're trying to hire as many people as we can as fast as we can. And then I'll turn it to Glenn for the other question.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Jack, yes, we commented that the FSP is impacting -- or the loss of the contract impacted our results in the quarter. The loss of it was actually earlier in the year and -- but the impact of it winding down really didn't impact our first half results. So really more of a third quarter or fourth quarter impact. For the quarter, it was around, call it, $22 million that we would have had in there a year ago for the contract. So it negatively -- recall, it was around a 3% headwind on for the Clinical Development business, and roughly half of that would be a headwind for the Drug Development segment. But again, as we commented as well, we've been really pleased with the recent awards that we have. So as we think about going into 2023, the lost contract there will be replaced by other orders that we're getting.\nAdam Schechter: Exactly. The thing I'd add to is, overall, we feel good about the business fundamentals in both Diagnostics and Drug Development. The RFP inflow is strong. Our wins are strong. Even our ability to offset, as Glenn just said, the loss of that FSP with new wins and a large market access win that we have. So the fundamentals are strong. We believe these are temporary issues.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then as a follow-up, it's that time of year, everyone is focused on 2023. So I was wondering if you could just talk about puts and takes on EPS for next year. I think the COVID math, that 60% margin, suggests that could be a $5 headwind. I'm not sure if you agree with that. I think there's also probably some good guys with growth in Ascension, I look at The Street forecasting $18. Just any color on forecasting would be helpful.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. I'll give you some color, I'll ask Glenn to jump in. And we'll provide more complete guidance, obviously, in February. But first of all, what we're focused on: we want to execute the spin as fast and as effectively as we possibly can. So we are focused on that. We've accelerated to the middle of next year, and we're doing everything we can to move quickly there. Second, when you think about Ascension and not just Ascension, some of the other hospital deals are really big and important to us. We're focused on integrating them, and they're going to represent strong growth opportunities, and it's going to represent significant revenue growth opportunities. What we're focused on in Diagnostics is the inflationary pressures that will remain, and we've got to find ways to reduce costs and to improve our margins. These hospital deals are going to impact our margins negatively in the beginning. And over time, we'll be able to take costs out. When you do these hospital deals, the most important thing is business continuity for the hospitals at that time. In addition to that, we have PAMA headwind, obviously. We're working to see if there's a new way to think about PAMA, which is SALSA. We're not putting on our base case at the moment. But by February, we should have a very good idea of where we are there. And then we have other things that Glenn can talk about.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, overall -- maybe first kind of at a high level, Jack, that when you think about kind of the headwinds as we go into 2023, and Adam kind of alluded to and you did as well in your opening comments, but COVID testing, we'll know more, obviously, when we give our guidance in February. But the assumption is that it's going to be down pretty materially next year and following the trend that we've seen. But again, we'll have a better assessment when we give our guidance. But to your point, we did around 60% margin on COVID testing this year. And again, we talked about the going forward 24% tax right now. A big variable, again, as Adam commented on is PAMA. We've looked at around an $80 million to $100 million, if you will, range of an impact. But again, by the time that we give our guidance, we should know whether or not PAMA will be in the numbers for next year or not, we'll see. And then just the additional headwinds from the current inflationary environment and the labor constraints. Having said that, we really see a lot more positives than the headwinds that we're seeing. The demand levels, especially the momentum that we've seen in the Diagnostics business, not only have we seen volume levels pick up sequentially each quarter but even through the months of the quarter. So the expectation is that, that will continue into the fourth quarter and continue into 2023. And also, when you think about the correlation, while we're giving up high-margin COVID testing normally when -- if the expectation is that, that will be down to low levels, bodes better for the Base Business within Diagnostics as well. Similarly, Adam commented on the level of demand in Drug Development isn't the issue per se. It's more the kits issue that we said really hasn't come back to 2019 levels. And this is really the only aspect of even Drug Development, and it's really just the kits that are being returned. And so the expectation is the demand is there, the backlog is strong, the conversion that kits returned should come back to more normalized levels, and then hopefully, with the labor capacity issue abates a bit as well. And then you add to that another strong year of focus on cost measures, LaunchPad initiatives, another strong year of free cash flow generation, that will add to a good pipeline for acquisitions, let alone returning our capital. So when you stir it all together, we're actually pretty optimistic for '23 where we sit today. From a top line perspective, from our ability to drive margin improvement, realizing that we'll have headwinds from PAMA potentially as well as the annualization of Ascension will be a little bit of a margin headwind as well. But those combined with capital allocation, we feel actually pretty optimistic as we go into 2023.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: So where are we now in terms of business utilization across the Diagnostics segment compared to the pre-COVID baseline? And what are you seeing right now in terms of mix? Are there any sort of structural changes that we should be thinking about longer term? And just a follow-up on 2023 and how you're thinking about base organic diagnostic volume heading into that time period. Do you anticipate that we see a complete normalization in utilization trends? Or is it a build to that? And why or why not would that happen?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Erin, this is Glenn. I'll start on that one. So again, one of the really positive things that we have seen is that the volume levels have recovered within Diagnostics that we continue to see good growth this year, obviously, over last but also compared to 2019. And we're tracking from a volume standpoint, call it, a little bit over 1% kind of CAGR compared to where we were. So clearly, more room for growth, which is why as we enter into 2023, we feel that volumes will continue to pick up as we go through more of the recovery. When you look on the price/mix side, which again has also been positive, tracking to kind of more historical levels, plus or minus kind of 1% growth. We talk about there's always kind of the pricing pressures that we see, but we get positive on price/mix because of mix. We continue to see our esoteric and routine businesses growing, but esoteric, growing at a faster pace, which helps our mix acquisitions that tended to help our mix as well. And actually, when we think about now the large lab hospital management agreement we have with Ascension, as you know, we treat that as price as opposed to volume. So you'll see a pickup from that aspect as well as that becomes in the numbers and annualized. But acquisitions overall, we continue to see a slight improvement in our test per session. So a lot of positive momentum on the price/mix side as well as the volume side.\nAdam Schechter: And Erin, this is Adam. So I feel very good about the Diagnostics volume, and we're heading into next year with real strength. Our focus next year is going to be a lot of how can we improve margins and reduce costs. So that will be a big focus for us because we realize that the volume is going to grow extraordinarily well with these hospital deals. And we just have to make sure we get the margins to improve as fast as we can there.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe another one on the Drug Development side, just specifically on early development. You guys saw a sequential step-down there. I don't think that's happened in a couple of years. Just wanted to dive into that a little more specifically, what you're seeing there. Were there supply chain issues? Maybe talk about the demand environment and again, kind of the outlook on that piece because again, I don't think we've seen a sequential step-down a little bit there.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Patrick. We feel really good about our early development demand. In fact, our orders are good, our book-to-bill is good, our RFPs are good. One of the biggest issues is that if a customer comes to us right now, we can't start the study as fast as we'd like. We're into next year -- well into next year already. The biggest issue we're facing in early development is just labor, and trying to get enough people so that we can get as many studies up and running as possible is the real fundamental issue, and we're facing it in early development laboratories around the world. It's not specific to the United States. So we have huge efforts underway to try to hire as many people as we can. The second issue with labor is that bringing people to early development laboratories takes time. They have to be trained really well. So even as you hire people, it takes them longer than typical for them to be productive in a way that somebody that's been in our lab for a year is. So the issues that we're facing in early development is a labor issue.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from R. W. Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Following several similar questions, so maybe a bit redundant, but hoping we can get more specific. On Drug Development, could you talk about the overall cancellation rate and then parse that out across each of the segments? Could you actually give some demand metrics? I know you've talked about good orders, wins, RFPs, et cetera. But do you have any metrics you could actually share in terms of dollar volume increases across the segments or pipeline comments? And then is it possible, when you talk about cancellations, could you parse out cancellations that you're seeing due to actual client decisions not to go forward with the drug at all versus possibly share loss contract losses, things like the FSP? So just wanting to get to more of a market cancellation rate versus a share cancellation rate, if that's a possibility.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. I'll start, Eric, and I'll ask Glenn to add some context. So we've not seen an increase in cancellation rates across any of the 3 segments. In fact, we're seeing the number of RFPs increasing as a percent year-over-year across the different segments. So demand feels pretty good. In terms of share loss, we lost the one FSP that we're going to more than offset with wins that we have. Things come in and they come out of our book-to-bill all the time. But it's going to impact us in the third and fourth quarter, and then we'll more than offset that as we go into next year with the wins that we have. If you look at the backlog, it's relatively flattish. The order growth in the quarter was offset by currency due to the strength of the dollar, but the cancellation rates are in the low single digits, and it's been that way for a very, very long time. I don't know, Glenn, if you want to add anything.\nGlenn Eisenberg: No. I mean, I think that it's a -- we do provide it, Eric, is -- obviously, some key metrics that we think addresses that -- the level of orders that we have per quarter, the book-to-bill. Again, we talk about kind of the 1.2 or greater is really what we look for in order to hit kind of mid- to high single-digit growth rates. And obviously, the trailing 12 is at 1.25. So that continues to do well. The backlog, as Adam said, is up 6% year-on-year. The cancellation rates overall remain fairly steady. Again, as Adam said, kind of the low single digits is a normal process -- we have the normal gives and takes, if you will. The issue with the FSP contract and why we highlighted it for this quarter was not that it really had an impact kind of on the book-to-bill because we have stuff coming in, stuff coming out. But it was an existing contract so that we lose the revenues, if you will, on a year-over-year basis. Even though new orders coming in would offset, let's say, the cancellation, but the start-up for those revenues will be not in the current quarter.\nEric Coldwell: Is it possible -- if I can just do one follow-on. Is it possible to give us some sense of how understaffed you are in early development? Like what number of people are you looking to hire globally? And is it more technician? Or is it more -- what area is it? Are these vets? Are these pathologists? Are these -- what type of people are you looking? And how many are you looking to hire?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Sorry, I'd say 2 things. One is it's mostly the entry-level positions. It's not necessarily a pathologist or veterinarians. We're always having turnover and -- but the big issue is in entry-level position. The reason I'm not going to give you a percent is because it's not just the positions that we're filling, it's how long it's taking us to get people up to speed and trained. What I can say is that, with the work that we've done to increase our hiring rates, we've seen huge increases in the number of people that we're able to interview with the number of click rates on our sites because we've been doing a lot more through social media to try to hire people. So we are seeing that we are able to pick up demand, but it's still going to take us some time to train -- to get a really good laboratory technician fully trained could take up to 4 months, sometimes even longer, depending on how skilled they need to be.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: We talked a couple of times about the inflationary pressures. That's been something we've been talking about all year, but it sounds like you think that might be an incremental headwind next year. I guess I'd love to just flesh out because, I mean, I could see -- you think it's persistent, but persisting next year, which you're seeing this year. But to describe as an incremental headwind, I'd be interested to know where that's at. And it sounds like the offset -- one of the offsets has been the LaunchPad initiatives. Is it tougher to come up with those kind of savings programs? Are you finding it -- that's been going for a while. Are you finding it a little more challenging to find meaningful savings opportunities under that program?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No, thanks for the question, A.J. First of all, I'd say it's just continued inflationary pressure. But we're seeing it in a lot of areas of our cost structure. You're seeing it in materials, people-related expenses, supply chain and a tight labor market. So we're just focused on maintaining operational continuity while also managing through these headwinds. So it's not like there's new issues that we're facing. We just believe they're going to be continued issues that we're facing. The LaunchPad program, as you said, it's helping us mitigate these costs. We have plans in place. We have a path forward. We know how we're going after the LaunchPad initiatives. When we give you a number, we give that number with knowledge of how we're going to go after it and how we're going to get it. The key now that we're working on is how can we accelerate some of those savings, not do we know where they are. We know where they are. And some of them are in process improvements, some of those automation. Some of those take time, and we're trying to find ways to accelerate all of them.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: Can we talk a little bit about the impact Ascension's making and how to think about it? You gave us some numbers for 4Q in terms of the volumes and then also the margin pressure. Is the -- are the costs related to starting? Is that onetime in nature? Or is it just a lower-margin business that's going to have an adverse effect on the margins going forward? And is -- I know it closed in October. So is that a full quarter? Should we think about that as a full quarter? Or would it be more magnified going forward? Like how should we think about the impact?\nAdam Schechter: I'll give you some context, Kevin, and I'll ask Glenn to jump in and so forth. First of all, we just closed the deal on September 30. Typically, that business is lower-margin business to start with. When we take over these laboratories, the most important thing that we do is ensure that the physicians can order and we can perform the test seamlessly if not better than what they had before. So we don't take out costs, we don't change systems, we don't change supply chain in the beginning. We just transition over the work with minimal disruption. And then over time, we use our scale and our capabilities to reduce their cost and improve the margins. So this is more about making sure that we do this the right way. This is a massive undertaking, and we want to make sure that there's no disruption to the patients and the physicians first and foremost. So the margins are very low in the beginning. And then over time, they get better. They never reach our historical margins in Diagnostics because it's just always going to be to some degree lower, but it will certainly get better over time. And then I'll ask if Glenn has any additional context.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, the only thing I'd add to that is that when we think about the hospital system deals, and Adam kind of alluded to it, very attractive deals financially. When we look at kind of return on invested capital, just a different profile. The in-hospital lab management agreements that we have are really a fee-based. So as a percent of revenues, it's a headwind to the overall revenues. The outreach labs that we acquire have margin profiles similar to or enhance the overall margin for the Diagnostics group. But given the size of Ascension and the size of the in-hospital lab management agreement, it tends to -- this is a higher percentage of in-hospital than a typical even hospital system deal we would do. We commented that it would be around 100 basis points negative impact to us in the fourth quarter. And then as Adam said, with the expectation that margins will grow as we integrate it into 2023 and beyond, but it will have less of a headwind in '23 as the margins pick up above what the first quarter would affect us.\nKevin Caliendo: So the net effect, you didn't really call it out as a headwind or a tailwind for '23. Should we assume that from an EBIT perspective, net-net, it's neutral then?\nGlenn Eisenberg: So from an EBIT perspective, call it, the first quarter. So the fourth quarter, first time we have it is kind of neutral. It will be positive from a profitability standpoint next year. So again, as you look at our financial criteria for acquisitions and these partnerships, we look for them to be accretive to earnings year 1, earn cost of capital by year 3 and have a very attractive IRR. And Ascension is no different. The first full year of ownership, positive to earnings and cash flow accretion. We'll earn our cost of capital at least by year 3 as an overall transaction. So we're excited about it, but with an acknowledgment that from a return on revenues, it will be dilutive to diagnostics markets.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan Chase.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So just following up on the Drug Development side. So you talked a bit about the kit stocking dynamic. Last quarter, you said that, that was a $30 million revenue headwind. So can you just quantify how much of a headwind it was this quarter? And then what's assumed within guidance for kit stocking heading into 4Q and early next year as well?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll take the second part first, Rachel. So we're assuming that the kits coming back to us do not improve for the rest of this year. We've not seen improvement, therefore, for the rest of this year, we're assuming no additional improvement from where we are, which is slightly lower than the 2019 levels. In terms of kits out the door, they're actually at 2019 rate as we sit here today. And when I say 2019, I think 2019 and I put projected 4% or 5% growth on that each year. And when you get to this year, where you would expect us to be if we grew 4% or 5% CAGR since 2019. So kits out the doors look good and they're back to where they need to be. We want to get some more time under our belts to see as the kits start to come back to us faster, and we'll provide more information for 2023 where we give 2023 guidance. But for the rest of the year, we've taken out significant growth and kits back to us.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So Rachel, to your comment, obviously, it continues to be at roughly that level on what we would call COVID-related. So roughly half of the cost impacting us from a revenue standpoint would be the kits. So call it, around $25 million impact during the quarter year-on-year. And similarly, the lower vaccine and therapeutics related to COVID would have the same amount of impact on the revenues for the quarter.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.\nJohn Kim: This is John on for Derik. You did a good amount of share buybacks in the quarter, and you're continuing to target hospital deals and local lab deals. Are there any additional areas that you're looking to prior to the Covance spin? And also, I wanted to ask if you're seeing any trends or -- trends in bad debts and then if you have any expectations there.\nAdam Schechter: I'll answer the first part. So if you look at our capital allocation, we continue to be committed to our dividend. We continue to look at these hospital and local laboratory deals. They help us with our growth in our core. They're accretive first year to return the cost of capital quickly. And then we continue to believe we are undervalued. So share buybacks will continue to be a big part of our capital allocation, and we still have over $800 million that are available to us.\nGlenn Eisenberg: And John, on the bad debt, again, not seeing really any change. Again, Drug Development, we normally don't have any bandwidth issues in the Diagnostics side. It's been at a fairly steady state. I would say, probably see a little bit of an increase now that the HRSA for the COVID testing. So when you look at our 50% margin that we did in the quarter, let alone expected in the fourth, there's a little bit of that associated with it. But as a general rule, bad debt continues to be consistent with what we would have experienced in the past.\nJohn Kim: Got you. And just one more. Has the turnover for frontline workers stabilized? Or do you see any additional need to reinstate retention program bonuses or anything like that?\nAdam Schechter: I would say it continues to be an issue with labor almost everywhere that I look in the economy, and frankly, around the world. I don't think it's getting worse. I just think it continues to be the same. So at this point in time, we're doing a lot of work on what we can do to retain people, attract people. We're facing very similar issues that other health care companies, but also even more broadly than that are facing.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. And John, when you look at our difference between our reconciliation in our financial statements that we said and we do break out retention. And you'll see, as Adam said, we continue to use that where needed. But overall, not a material issue.\nAdam Schechter: Okay, so I want to -- yes, thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I believe that we have a lot to be excited about when we look at the future in the coming year. And then we're going to make continued progress. We know what we have to get done, and we're going to get it done. I want to welcome our associates from Ascension, and I want to once again thank our employees around the world who are carrying out their critical mission to improve their critical mission to improve health next day for everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss our progress and our performance in the third quarter. I'll start with a few high-level comments about the quarter, then provide a brief update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development business before turning to our quarterly results and progress against our strategy. Diagnostics performed very well with Base Business revenue growth of 3.7% over the last year and a 4% CAGR versus 2019. With Ascension in the fourth quarter, we expect full year revenue growth of 6% to 7%. Drug Development Base Business fundamentals remain strong. And our expected full year CAGR of almost 8% since 2019 is consistent with how we expect the business to perform. There are what we believe to be temporary issues that impacted our Drug Development performance in the quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail when outlining our results. Turning now to the spin of our Clinical Development business. We are off to a strong start since announcing the planned spin back in July. We were quick to establish a spin management office made up of dedicated people and external advisers with significant spin transaction experience.  In addition, working with advisers, we're in the process of identifying members of the executive team, the CEO and the Board of Directors of the new company. And finally, we are making good progress to finding their transition service agreements and preparing the audited financial statements. With the progress to date, we are targeting completion of the spin with an accelerated time frame of mid-2023, subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including those related to the tax-free nature of the separation and the SEC process. Upon completion, we will create 2 strong independent companies through a tax-free transaction. We are excited by the opportunities this spin represents for the Clinical Development business. The new company will have the enhanced strategic flexibility and operational focus to grow, invest, pursue its priorities and address market opportunities. Further, we believe both Labcorp and the new Clinical Development business will emerge from this transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs, drive sustainable and profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. We plan to provide more information on our progress, including key leadership appointments, in the coming months. I'll now turn to third quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $4.68, and free cash flow was $270 million. Base Business organic revenue for the enterprise, excluding COVID testing revenue, is up 1.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This demonstrates the strength of our underlying business, particularly in Diagnostics, in a very challenging operating environment marked by rising labor costs, labor shortages and other inflationary pressures. In Diagnostics, Base Business revenue increased about 4% year-over-year due to an uptick in demand in both routine and esoteric testing. We continue to see momentum in our hospital system business. And later, I'll give an update on the Ascension integration, which is off to a very good start. In Drug Development, quarterly Base Business revenue in constant currency is flat versus the prior year. This is driven by a tough year-over-year comparison with less COVID-related work and the impact from the conflict in Ukraine. In central laboratories, there were timing-related challenges when looking at kits out, those that we sent to investigator sites; and kits returned, those that investigators sent back to us to be analyzed. We believe investigators ordered significantly more kits than normal in the third quarter last year to overcome supply issues. This was in addition to the kits for COVID trials. The pace of investigators returning kits has not rebounded as quickly as we expected. We believe this is largely due to COVID-related impacts and the macro environment, and that will return to normal levels over time. Both demand and orders in central laboratories continue to be very strong. In early development, we have strong demand for trial work as well as adequate capacity. However, the impact from our business was due to labor constraints. We are hiring as fast as we can. But like in many parts of the economy, finding labor has been difficult. Drug Development Base Business margins for the quarter were 15%, an expansion from last quarter but lower than anticipated due to the revenue in central laboratories and labor shortages in early development. We continue to see a healthy order flow and backlog in Drug Development, and the segment ended the quarter with a 1.25 trailing 12-month book-to-bill. Across Diagnostics and Drug Development, our margins were negatively impacted by rising labor costs and other inflationary pressures. We are taking cost actions, and we're focused on improving margins. In addition, LaunchPad savings continue to help offset the impact of near and expected midterm headwinds. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results in just a moment. COVID PCR testing volumes continued to decline during the quarter, totaling 2.2 million tests performed and averaging 24,000 per day. As we enter the winter amid concerns about rising COVID, flu and RSV cases, we're maintaining adequate supply and capacity to accommodate current and future testing needs. Also, our scientists stand ready to respond as new variants arise. I'll now move to our enterprise strategy against which we're executing well by harnessing science, innovation and technology and capitalizing on key opportunities to help us deliver for all stakeholders. Earlier this month, we announced the completion of transactions that established our comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension. Our strategic collaboration includes an agreement for Labcorp to manage hospital labs in 10 states and to acquire certain lab assets. At its core, the collaboration expands access to Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities and laboratory services for communities served by Ascension. I'm pleased to report that the transition and the integration are going well, and we are now performing thousands of tests across the health system. This was a big undertaking, and I'd like to thank employees and leadership from Ascension and Labcorp who make the changeover as seamless as possible. In addition to the Ascension agreement, we're focused on accelerating our hospital and health systems business. We completed our acquisition of the outreach lab business and related assets of New Jersey-based RWJBarnabas Health during the quarter, and that integration is also progressing well. Our hospital and local lab acquisition and investment pipeline is very robust, and we see major opportunity now through 2023. Turning to oncology. We're furthering our position as a leader in this space through the addition of new testing and screening capabilities. We continue to see benefits from the Personal Genome Diagnostics, an omni portfolios, including their leading liquid biopsy, tissue-based diagnostics and kitting solutions. We have the broadest portfolio and capabilities in oncology diagnostics today, and we are well positioned for growth. We are also pursuing relationships that accelerate our growth and enhance our portfolio. This quarter, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. We also entered a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases. In addition to our progress in oncology, Labcorp is relentlessly focused on innovating and delivering our customers valuable solutions across all areas to help them achieve their goals. We enhanced our neurology offering in the quarter through the launch of a pan-neoplastic and other neuro autoimmune panels, Together with our previously announced test for brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, these panels round out our portfolio and give us a leadership position in neuro biomarkers to support customers. The company has seen growing demand for our at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand, and our consumer product pipeline is strong. Our FDA authorization, combination COVID, flu, RSV at-home collection test continues to be important with the rise of respiratory virus cases expected this fall and through the winter. Lastly, Labcorp's commitment to its employees continues to be recognized. We recently were named by the Forbes to its list of World's Best Employers, and we also earned a top score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index. In summary, our base business fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned to deliver sustained long-term value and growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Jack, I'll go first. So first of all, if you look at Drug Development overall and you look at our new guidance at the midpoint, the full year growth would represent 7.7%, almost 8%, CAGR since it's 2019. So that's about what you would expect for the business. But what's changed, frankly, is that we're seeing a larger-than-expected impact from kits in central laboratory. That's the most significant change. What happened last year was investigators ordered more kits than they typically would because there were some supply issues. So for example, butterfly needles were in short supply for a period of time. Some of the test tubes that we need that go in those kits were in short supply. And typically, when an investigator order a kit, we'd be able to get it to them in 2 or 3 days. With the supply issues, sometimes it was taking quite a bit longer than that. So once we had supply of kits, the investigators were ordering many more than what they actually needed. It was only like hoarding of the kits. That's very difficult to track, it's very difficult to know exactly how many they're using at any period of time versus the number of kits that they have. At the same time, we were sending out a lot of kits because of the COVID trials. And the COVID trial kits were coming back to us very quickly because they were enrolling very fast. We were sending them out some massive numbers of investigators because everybody was focused on those COVID trials. So it kind of masked the return rates of the kits for non-COVID-related trials. As we sit here today, what we're seeing is the kits going out in the third quarter of this year were about 30% lower the number of kits that we sent out in the third quarter of last year. So it's pretty significant. And we get paid for each kit that goes out. But even more significant, the number of kits coming back to us are not at 2019 levels yet. And we actually make most of our money on the kits that come back to us because that's when we perform all of the tests on the samples that come back to us. Now we believe that's temporary. We think it's -- sometimes when there's COVID issues like in Europe and so forth, it slows down the kits coming back. There could be some labor issues at the sites that are slowing down the kits coming back to us. The kits will come back to us. The trials will enroll. So we think it's a temporary timing issue. The reason we didn't flag it before now is when we looked at the beginning of the summer, the kits coming back to us were actually starting to increase. So we felt like they would continue to increase. Unfortunately, they leveled off very quickly and they've not increased again since that time. So again, we believe it's temporary, and we're working on it. But it's certainly something that's new based on what we've seen in third quarter, and we've expected that to continue in our guidance in fourth quarter. At the same time, the other issue we have is just labor. I mean finding labor is hard right now, particularly for frontline and other important personnel that you need in your laboratories. And it's not only hard to find them, but once you find them, training for something in the laboratory takes a lot longer than most other workers. And it takes them a while before they become fully productive. So when you look at our early development business, that business looks great in terms of orders, in terms of our capacity, in terms of RFPs. The issue that we're facing there is we just can't get all the studies up and running as fast as we'd like because we're needing more personnel. And we're doing everything we can. If you look at Madison, Wisconsin, we have a large lab. We actually have buses wrapped in Labcorp talking about come to one of our career centers because we're trying to hire as many people as we can as fast as we can. And then I'll turn it to Glenn for the other question. Exactly. The thing I'd add to is, overall, we feel good about the business fundamentals in both Diagnostics and Drug Development. The RFP inflow is strong. Our wins are strong. Even our ability to offset, as Glenn just said, the loss of that FSP with new wins and a large market access win that we have. So the fundamentals are strong. We believe these are temporary issues. Yes. I'll give you some color, I'll ask Glenn to jump in. And we'll provide more complete guidance, obviously, in February. But first of all, what we're focused on: we want to execute the spin as fast and as effectively as we possibly can. So we are focused on that. We've accelerated to the middle of next year, and we're doing everything we can to move quickly there. Second, when you think about Ascension and not just Ascension, some of the other hospital deals are really big and important to us. We're focused on integrating them, and they're going to represent strong growth opportunities, and it's going to represent significant revenue growth opportunities. What we're focused on in Diagnostics is the inflationary pressures that will remain, and we've got to find ways to reduce costs and to improve our margins. These hospital deals are going to impact our margins negatively in the beginning. And over time, we'll be able to take costs out. When you do these hospital deals, the most important thing is business continuity for the hospitals at that time. In addition to that, we have PAMA headwind, obviously. We're working to see if there's a new way to think about PAMA, which is SALSA. We're not putting on our base case at the moment. But by February, we should have a very good idea of where we are there. And then we have other things that Glenn can talk about. And Erin, this is Adam. So I feel very good about the Diagnostics volume, and we're heading into next year with real strength. Our focus next year is going to be a lot of how can we improve margins and reduce costs. So that will be a big focus for us because we realize that the volume is going to grow extraordinarily well with these hospital deals. And we just have to make sure we get the margins to improve as fast as we can there. Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Patrick. We feel really good about our early development demand. In fact, our orders are good, our book-to-bill is good, our RFPs are good. One of the biggest issues is that if a customer comes to us right now, we can't start the study as fast as we'd like. We're into next year -- well into next year already. The biggest issue we're facing in early development is just labor, and trying to get enough people so that we can get as many studies up and running as possible is the real fundamental issue, and we're facing it in early development laboratories around the world. It's not specific to the United States. So we have huge efforts underway to try to hire as many people as we can. The second issue with labor is that bringing people to early development laboratories takes time. They have to be trained really well. So even as you hire people, it takes them longer than typical for them to be productive in a way that somebody that's been in our lab for a year is. So the issues that we're facing in early development is a labor issue. Yes. I'll start, Eric, and I'll ask Glenn to add some context. So we've not seen an increase in cancellation rates across any of the 3 segments. In fact, we're seeing the number of RFPs increasing as a percent year-over-year across the different segments. So demand feels pretty good. In terms of share loss, we lost the one FSP that we're going to more than offset with wins that we have. Things come in and they come out of our book-to-bill all the time. But it's going to impact us in the third and fourth quarter, and then we'll more than offset that as we go into next year with the wins that we have. If you look at the backlog, it's relatively flattish. The order growth in the quarter was offset by currency due to the strength of the dollar, but the cancellation rates are in the low single digits, and it's been that way for a very, very long time. I don't know, Glenn, if you want to add anything. Yes. Sorry, I'd say 2 things. One is it's mostly the entry-level positions. It's not necessarily a pathologist or veterinarians. We're always having turnover and -- but the big issue is in entry-level position. The reason I'm not going to give you a percent is because it's not just the positions that we're filling, it's how long it's taking us to get people up to speed and trained. What I can say is that, with the work that we've done to increase our hiring rates, we've seen huge increases in the number of people that we're able to interview with the number of click rates on our sites because we've been doing a lot more through social media to try to hire people. So we are seeing that we are able to pick up demand, but it's still going to take us some time to train -- to get a really good laboratory technician fully trained could take up to 4 months, sometimes even longer, depending on how skilled they need to be. Yes. No, thanks for the question, A.J. First of all, I'd say it's just continued inflationary pressure. But we're seeing it in a lot of areas of our cost structure. You're seeing it in materials, people-related expenses, supply chain and a tight labor market. So we're just focused on maintaining operational continuity while also managing through these headwinds. So it's not like there's new issues that we're facing. We just believe they're going to be continued issues that we're facing. The LaunchPad program, as you said, it's helping us mitigate these costs. We have plans in place. We have a path forward. We know how we're going after the LaunchPad initiatives. When we give you a number, we give that number with knowledge of how we're going to go after it and how we're going to get it. The key now that we're working on is how can we accelerate some of those savings, not do we know where they are. We know where they are. And some of them are in process improvements, some of those automation. Some of those take time, and we're trying to find ways to accelerate all of them. I'll give you some context, Kevin, and I'll ask Glenn to jump in and so forth. First of all, we just closed the deal on September 30. Typically, that business is lower-margin business to start with. When we take over these laboratories, the most important thing that we do is ensure that the physicians can order and we can perform the test seamlessly if not better than what they had before. So we don't take out costs, we don't change systems, we don't change supply chain in the beginning. We just transition over the work with minimal disruption. And then over time, we use our scale and our capabilities to reduce their cost and improve the margins. So this is more about making sure that we do this the right way. This is a massive undertaking, and we want to make sure that there's no disruption to the patients and the physicians first and foremost. So the margins are very low in the beginning. And then over time, they get better. They never reach our historical margins in Diagnostics because it's just always going to be to some degree lower, but it will certainly get better over time. And then I'll ask if Glenn has any additional context. Yes. So I'll take the second part first, Rachel. So we're assuming that the kits coming back to us do not improve for the rest of this year. We've not seen improvement, therefore, for the rest of this year, we're assuming no additional improvement from where we are, which is slightly lower than the 2019 levels. In terms of kits out the door, they're actually at 2019 rate as we sit here today. And when I say 2019, I think 2019 and I put projected 4% or 5% growth on that each year. And when you get to this year, where you would expect us to be if we grew 4% or 5% CAGR since 2019. So kits out the doors look good and they're back to where they need to be. We want to get some more time under our belts to see as the kits start to come back to us faster, and we'll provide more information for 2023 where we give 2023 guidance. But for the rest of the year, we've taken out significant growth and kits back to us. I'll answer the first part. So if you look at our capital allocation, we continue to be committed to our dividend. We continue to look at these hospital and local laboratory deals. They help us with our growth in our core. They're accretive first year to return the cost of capital quickly. And then we continue to believe we are undervalued. So share buybacks will continue to be a big part of our capital allocation, and we still have over $800 million that are available to us. I would say it continues to be an issue with labor almost everywhere that I look in the economy, and frankly, around the world. I don't think it's getting worse. I just think it continues to be the same. So at this point in time, we're doing a lot of work on what we can do to retain people, attract people. We're facing very similar issues that other health care companies, but also even more broadly than that are facing. Okay, so I want to -- yes, thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I believe that we have a lot to be excited about when we look at the future in the coming year. And then we're going to make continued progress. We know what we have to get done, and we're going to get it done. I want to welcome our associates from Ascension, and I want to once again thank our employees around the world who are carrying out their critical mission to improve their critical mission to improve health next day for everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.6 billion, a decrease of 11.2% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency translation. This was partially offset by organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 70% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 0.7% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 1.4%. Operating income for the quarter was $469 million or 13% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $65 million of amortization and $54 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, the proposed spin of the Clinical Development business, facility rationalization and other LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, the adjusted operating income in the quarter was $589 million or 16.3% of revenue compared to $907 million or 22.3% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing and the impact from acquisitions. The benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings were essentially offset by higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs. The tax rate for the quarter was 16.2%. The adjusted tax rate was 22.8% compared to 24.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to benefits from increased R&D tax credits. We now expect our annual adjusted tax rate going forward to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $353 million or $3.90 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.68 in the quarter compared to $6.82 last year. Operating cash flow was $374 million in the quarter compared to $767 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to lower cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $104 million, down from $118 million last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of Base Business revenue. Free cash flow was $270 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested $459 million on acquisitions, paid out $65 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of stock, representing 1.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had over $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to believe that our shares are undervalued, and our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. At quarter end, we had $400 million in cash, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 1.7x gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Excluding COVID testing earnings, our leverage was 2.5x, in line with our targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 15.7% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 16.4%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.9%. COVID testing revenue was down 70% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 3.7% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.3%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 10.3% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 10.9%, partially offset by acquisition of 0.6%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing as Base Business volume grew 3.1% compared to the Base Business last year. Price/mix decreased 5.4% versus last year, primarily due to an organic decline of 5.5%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.3%. The lower organic price/mix was due to COVID testing. Base Business price/mix was up 0.6% compared to Base Business last year, benefiting from higher esoteric test mix. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $440 million or 19.9% of revenue compared to $775 million or 29.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as lower COVID volumes caused margins to decline to approximately 50% for the quarter. We expect this margin level to continue through the rest of the year, which would put full year margin at approximately 60%. Base Business margins were flat versus last year as organic growth and LaunchPad savings were offset by higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 3.7% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign exchange translation of minus 3.4%. While acquisitions contributed 0.5% of growth, organic Base Business revenues declined 0.7% compared to last year due to the negative impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenue grew 3.8%. The central lab business continues to be the most impacted by lower COVID-related revenues and the impact from Ukraine-Russia crisis. Central lab Base Business revenues were down 9.8%. However, excluding these items, organic constant currency revenue was up 4.1%. While on a comparable basis, early development was up 8.6% and Clinical Development was up 2.3%. In addition, Clinical Development was impacted by the loss of an FSP contract outside the U.S. earlier this year, affecting third and fourth quarter revenue growth. However, recent wins, including a large Phase IV market access program, will support a return to higher growth in 2023. Reported Drug Development revenues grew 3 -- or 6.1% on a compounded annual basis compared to 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $211 million or 15% of revenue compared to $226 million or 15.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to the reduction of COVID-related work in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these issues, margins would have been up approximately 100 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by inflationary costs and the negative mix impact from acquisitions. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 6% to 7.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 275 basis points, primarily due to the slower pace of central lab kits shipped and kits received, early development labor constraints, lower COVID testing, the delay in the Ascension transaction and currency. This guidance now includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 3% to 4%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 57% to 59%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 10% to 11.5% compared to 2021. This guidance reflects a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint as the benefit from Ascension will be mostly offset by lower COVID testing demand. Diagnostics Base Business revenue is expected to grow 6% to 7%, an increase of 150 basis points at our midpoint due to Ascension now being reflected in the segment outlook, while it was in our enterprise guidance prior to closing the transaction. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 5%. Note that Ascension will be dilutive to Diagnostics AOI margin of approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, but we expect margins to improve going forward as they are fully integrated. COVID testing is now expected to decline 57% to 59%. We expect PCR volume to be between 15,000 to 20,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We are currently tracking at approximately 15,000 PCR tests per day. We expect Drug Development revenue to decline 1.5% to 2.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 450 basis points, primarily due to the slower pace of kits shipped and kits received in central labs, labor constraints in early development and further currency translation headwinds. We expect the Base Business to decline 1% to 2% compared to 2021. Foreign currency translation negatively impacts our growth rate by 280 basis points. In addition, the growth rate is constrained by lower COVID-related work in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 7.7%. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $19.25 to $20.25, a narrowing of our prior guidance range of $19 to $21.25. At the midpoint, our guidance is lower by $0.38 due to lower COVID testing. In the Base Business, the decreased revenue outlook for Drug Development is being offset by additional cost control measures and the low effective tax rate. Free cash flow guidance is now $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion, down from our prior guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. The decline in the cash outlook is due to lower projected cash earnings and higher working capital requirements. The lower cash earnings include the expected decrease in adjusted net earnings, the proposed spin and acquisition-related costs as well as the timing of cash tax payments. The higher working capital requirements, which are timing-related, primarily relates to Drug Development receivable collections as the company continues to work to improve days sales outstanding. Said differently, DSOs remained flat over the past quarter, but our guidance had assumed improvement in the second half of the year. In summary, our Diagnostics business continued to perform well, while our Drug Development business fundamentals remain strong in a challenging environment. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the fourth quarter, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline from the third quarter. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we'll now take questions. Jack, yes, we commented that the FSP is impacting -- or the loss of the contract impacted our results in the quarter. The loss of it was actually earlier in the year and -- but the impact of it winding down really didn't impact our first half results. So really more of a third quarter or fourth quarter impact. For the quarter, it was around, call it, $22 million that we would have had in there a year ago for the contract. So it negatively -- recall, it was around a 3% headwind on for the Clinical Development business, and roughly half of that would be a headwind for the Drug Development segment. But again, as we commented as well, we've been really pleased with the recent awards that we have. So as we think about going into 2023, the lost contract there will be replaced by other orders that we're getting. Yes. No, overall -- maybe first kind of at a high level, Jack, that when you think about kind of the headwinds as we go into 2023, and Adam kind of alluded to and you did as well in your opening comments, but COVID testing, we'll know more, obviously, when we give our guidance in February. But the assumption is that it's going to be down pretty materially next year and following the trend that we've seen. But again, we'll have a better assessment when we give our guidance. But to your point, we did around 60% margin on COVID testing this year. And again, we talked about the going forward 24% tax right now. A big variable, again, as Adam commented on is PAMA. We've looked at around an $80 million to $100 million, if you will, range of an impact. But again, by the time that we give our guidance, we should know whether or not PAMA will be in the numbers for next year or not, we'll see. And then just the additional headwinds from the current inflationary environment and the labor constraints. Having said that, we really see a lot more positives than the headwinds that we're seeing. The demand levels, especially the momentum that we've seen in the Diagnostics business, not only have we seen volume levels pick up sequentially each quarter but even through the months of the quarter. So the expectation is that, that will continue into the fourth quarter and continue into 2023. And also, when you think about the correlation, while we're giving up high-margin COVID testing normally when -- if the expectation is that, that will be down to low levels, bodes better for the Base Business within Diagnostics as well. Similarly, Adam commented on the level of demand in Drug Development isn't the issue per se. It's more the kits issue that we said really hasn't come back to 2019 levels. And this is really the only aspect of even Drug Development, and it's really just the kits that are being returned. And so the expectation is the demand is there, the backlog is strong, the conversion that kits returned should come back to more normalized levels, and then hopefully, with the labor capacity issue abates a bit as well. And then you add to that another strong year of focus on cost measures, LaunchPad initiatives, another strong year of free cash flow generation, that will add to a good pipeline for acquisitions, let alone returning our capital. So when you stir it all together, we're actually pretty optimistic for '23 where we sit today. From a top line perspective, from our ability to drive margin improvement, realizing that we'll have headwinds from PAMA potentially as well as the annualization of Ascension will be a little bit of a margin headwind as well. But those combined with capital allocation, we feel actually pretty optimistic as we go into 2023. Erin, this is Glenn. I'll start on that one. So again, one of the really positive things that we have seen is that the volume levels have recovered within Diagnostics that we continue to see good growth this year, obviously, over last but also compared to 2019. And we're tracking from a volume standpoint, call it, a little bit over 1% kind of CAGR compared to where we were. So clearly, more room for growth, which is why as we enter into 2023, we feel that volumes will continue to pick up as we go through more of the recovery. When you look on the price/mix side, which again has also been positive, tracking to kind of more historical levels, plus or minus kind of 1% growth. We talk about there's always kind of the pricing pressures that we see, but we get positive on price/mix because of mix. We continue to see our esoteric and routine businesses growing, but esoteric, growing at a faster pace, which helps our mix acquisitions that tended to help our mix as well. And actually, when we think about now the large lab hospital management agreement we have with Ascension, as you know, we treat that as price as opposed to volume. So you'll see a pickup from that aspect as well as that becomes in the numbers and annualized. But acquisitions overall, we continue to see a slight improvement in our test per session. So a lot of positive momentum on the price/mix side as well as the volume side. No. I mean, I think that it's a -- we do provide it, Eric, is -- obviously, some key metrics that we think addresses that -- the level of orders that we have per quarter, the book-to-bill. Again, we talk about kind of the 1.2 or greater is really what we look for in order to hit kind of mid- to high single-digit growth rates. And obviously, the trailing 12 is at 1.25. So that continues to do well. The backlog, as Adam said, is up 6% year-on-year. The cancellation rates overall remain fairly steady. Again, as Adam said, kind of the low single digits is a normal process -- we have the normal gives and takes, if you will. The issue with the FSP contract and why we highlighted it for this quarter was not that it really had an impact kind of on the book-to-bill because we have stuff coming in, stuff coming out. But it was an existing contract so that we lose the revenues, if you will, on a year-over-year basis. Even though new orders coming in would offset, let's say, the cancellation, but the start-up for those revenues will be not in the current quarter. Yes. No, the only thing I'd add to that is that when we think about the hospital system deals, and Adam kind of alluded to it, very attractive deals financially. When we look at kind of return on invested capital, just a different profile. The in-hospital lab management agreements that we have are really a fee-based. So as a percent of revenues, it's a headwind to the overall revenues. The outreach labs that we acquire have margin profiles similar to or enhance the overall margin for the Diagnostics group. But given the size of Ascension and the size of the in-hospital lab management agreement, it tends to -- this is a higher percentage of in-hospital than a typical even hospital system deal we would do. We commented that it would be around 100 basis points negative impact to us in the fourth quarter. And then as Adam said, with the expectation that margins will grow as we integrate it into 2023 and beyond, but it will have less of a headwind in '23 as the margins pick up above what the first quarter would affect us. So from an EBIT perspective, call it, the first quarter. So the fourth quarter, first time we have it is kind of neutral. It will be positive from a profitability standpoint next year. So again, as you look at our financial criteria for acquisitions and these partnerships, we look for them to be accretive to earnings year 1, earn cost of capital by year 3 and have a very attractive IRR. And Ascension is no different. The first full year of ownership, positive to earnings and cash flow accretion. We'll earn our cost of capital at least by year 3 as an overall transaction. So we're excited about it, but with an acknowledgment that from a return on revenues, it will be dilutive to diagnostics markets. Yes. So Rachel, to your comment, obviously, it continues to be at roughly that level on what we would call COVID-related. So roughly half of the cost impacting us from a revenue standpoint would be the kits. So call it, around $25 million impact during the quarter year-on-year. And similarly, the lower vaccine and therapeutics related to COVID would have the same amount of impact on the revenues for the quarter. And John, on the bad debt, again, not seeing really any change. Again, Drug Development, we normally don't have any bandwidth issues in the Diagnostics side. It's been at a fairly steady state. I would say, probably see a little bit of an increase now that the HRSA for the COVID testing. So when you look at our 50% margin that we did in the quarter, let alone expected in the fourth, there's a little bit of that associated with it. But as a general rule, bad debt continues to be consistent with what we would have experienced in the past. Yes. And John, when you look at our difference between our reconciliation in our financial statements that we said and we do break out retention. And you'll see, as Adam said, we continue to use that where needed. But overall, not a material issue."

Chas Cook, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both a press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call as well as a presentation on additional information on the spin-off of the clinical development business. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2022 guidance and the related assumptions; the proposed spin-off of the clinical development business; the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions; future business strategies; expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative and from acquisitions; and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas, and good morning, everybody. Today, we announced we are pursuing the spin of our clinical development business, and we released our second quarter results. It's an exciting day for Labcorp, and we have a lot to cover. So I'll start with the spin. We are pursuing the spin of our clinical development business to shareholders through a tax-free transaction. This transaction will create 2 leading, independent and global public companies that will each be well positioned to innovate, grow significantly and enhance shareholder value. This announcement marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for our businesses and is a testament to our team's growth mindset, resilience and determination over the last several years. The decision to spin off the clinical development business resulted from our Board and management team's ongoing review of opportunities, including discussions with third parties, that best position us for growth, success with our customers and shareholder value creation. When we announced the conclusion of our strategic review in December of last year, we determined that the company's structure was in the best interest of stakeholders at that time. We reiterated that management and the Board were committed to continuing to evaluate all avenues for enhancing customer and shareholder value. We have now determined that spinning off the clinical development business is the best path forward to achieve this objective. The planned spin will position our businesses to thrive as 2 independent companies with greater strategic flexibility and operational focus to innovate, to pursue their distinct priorities and to better meet customer needs and capture growth opportunities. Each company will benefit from its own capital structure, enhanced investor alignment through a more targeted investment opportunity and a differentiated value proposition. Each will be well capitalized and positioned to generate substantial top and bottom line growth with strong free cash flow and attractive returns. We expect this transaction to drive significant value for shareholders as we'll provide investors with the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of 2 leading global businesses in the health care sector. This transaction allows Labcorp to move forward as a strong, global, innovative laboratory services business with significant growth potential. The Labcorp business will include routine and esoteric labs, central labs and early development research labs. In 2021, these businesses reported testing for 82% of the therapeutics submitted to the FDA, tested patients grew over 100 countries and performed over 650 million tests globally. Each is a leader in their respective markets. The combination of these businesses creates a cohesive global provider of laboratory-focused services with complementary resources, significant scale and a diverse customer base poised to grow in a global addressable market of over $150 billion. Labcorp's customers will continue to benefit from its deep scientific expertise, our innovative mindset, our vast health data and insights as well as our advanced global laboratory network. With a more focused platform for growth, we expect Labcorp will be able to capture upside as we advance innovations to deliver on our customers' future needs. Over the last 4 quarters, the lab businesses delivered total revenue of $12.7 billion or $10.5 billion excluding COVID testing revenue. These businesses grew at a 5.5% CAGR from the second quarter 2019 and the second quarter of 2022, excluding COVID testing revenue. Going forward, Labcorp is expected to deliver mid-single-digit annual revenue growth, and we remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. The clinical development business will continue to be a leading global provider of Phase I through Phase IV clinical trial management, market access and technology solutions, serving a broad customer base, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations. It will be positioned to compete and to win in a growing and dynamic market, including extending its leadership in oncology, cell and gene therapy, rare diseases and other emerging therapeutic areas. The clinical development business will be able to implement a capital structure that is tailored to support its growth strategy and enhance stakeholder value. Importantly, we expect the clinical development business will retain access to Labcorp's vast health and clinical data set through an arrangement to support clinical development customers with the ability to tap into Labcorp's unique data and capabilities. The clinical development business will be poised to capitalize on its innovation and technology platform to drive significant growth. Over the last 4 quarters, the clinical development business delivered total revenue of $3 billion. This business grew at an 8% CAGR from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2022. Going forward, the clinical development business is expected to deliver high single-digit revenue growth. We will have a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. I want to emphasize that each business has delivered strong performance, and we expect that Labcorp and the clinical development business will be poised for even greater growth as independent, more focused companies. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of next year, and we look forward to sharing more about its progress in the future. I'll now move to cover the company's second quarter performance and provide an update on progress against our strategy before turning it over to Glenn. The Base Business in the quarter continued to perform well despite ongoing impacts from COVID, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and foreign exchange rates. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.7 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $4.96, and free cash flow was $429 million. In Diagnostics, Base Business revenue for the quarter was up 3.9% versus the prior year due to increased demand for both routine and esoteric testing. The Base Business CAGR was 4.3% from 2019 pre-COVID, demonstrating strong, continued underlying performance. Drug Development revenue was flat in constant currency data in the quarter versus last year, with growth in early development and clinical development offset by central labs. Central labs was impacted by the significant slowdown in COVID-related work and the Russia-Ukraine crisis. On a CAGR basis, in 2019, pre-COVID, the Drug Development Base Business grew 9%. Margins in Drug Development improved in the quarter to 14.7% and are expected to continue to increase throughout the year. Glenn will provide more detail on our second quarter results in a moment. Now I'll provide a brief update on our efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and most recently, assist in the monkeypox outbreak. COVID PCR volumes totaled 2.8 million for the second quarter, averaging 31,000 per day. Time to results remained 1 day on average. With respect to the monkeypox outbreak, in collaboration with the CDC and FDA, we became the first national laboratory to begin testing for monkeypox using the CDC test. I'll now turn to progress against our strategy. In addition to today's announcement, we've made significant progress against our strategy by putting science, innovation and technology at the center of all we do. The company introduced multiple innovative and high-quality diagnostics to consumers and physicians in the quarter. We continued to expand our at-home test offerings through Labcorp OnDemand, including a first-of-kind blood collection device for diabetes risk screening. In addition, we launched an FDA-approved men's rapid fertility test. For brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, in July, we were first to begin offering a test that can help physicians diagnose conditions, including concussions, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Finally, we expanded our central labs kit production capabilities to improve delivery and address growing demand across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We announced the planned expansion of our central labs presence and drug development capabilities in Japan in collaboration with BML. Turning to oncology. We continue to deepen our leadership position by expanding our cancer-related diagnostic screening and testing portfolio and by partnering with our pharmaceutical clients. During the second quarter, we launched a new skin cancer test that give doctors actionable insights to help determine the best treatment options. The test is also expected to be used to support clinical trials. For patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, we're collaborating with Lilly and using Labcorp's OmniSeq INSIGHT genomic test to help physicians make more informed and personalized treatment decisions. Moving now to new and ongoing partnerships and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we acquired select outreach business assets and agreed to provide ongoing technical support to Prisma Health's hospital laboratories. We completed our acquisition of select clinical outreach business assets from AtlantiCare in New Jersey. We reached an agreement to acquire the clinical outreach business and related assets of RWJBarnabas Health, also in New Jersey. And the previously announced relationship with Ascension is progressing through normal regulatory approvals. We continue to have a very strong pipeline of health system and regional acquisition possibilities, and we look forward to announcing more in the future. In summary, we continue to deliver solid results, improve our performance and execute on our strategy to create long-term value for all stakeholders. We're encouraged by momentum heading into the second half of the year and by the strategic opportunity for Labcorp's growth and impact in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Overall, the company performed well in the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3.7% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency translation. This was mostly offset by organic Base Business growth and acquisitions net of divestitures. COVID testing revenue was down 42% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 1.2% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 1.6%. Operating income for the quarter was $526 million or 14.2% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $66 million of amortization and $64 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisition and integration costs, facility rationalization and other LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $656 million or 17.7% of revenue compared to $840 million or 21.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%. The adjusted tax rate was also 24.7% compared to 25.1% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25%. Net earnings for the quarter were $359 million or $3.87 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.96 in the quarter compared to $6.13 last year. Operating cash flow was $572 million in the quarter compared to $487 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings and favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $143 million, up from $97 million last year, primarily due to timing. As a result, free cash flow was $429 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested $100 million on acquisitions, paid out $67 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of stock, representing 1.7 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 4.7% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 5.7%, partially offset by acquisitions of 1.2%. COVID testing revenue was down 42% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 3.9% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.3%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 2.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 3.1% partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.4%. COVID testing volume was down 45% compared to COVID testing last year, while Base Business volume grew 3.4% compared to the Base Business last year. We continue to see Base Business volumes improve as we're now up 0.6% on a compounded basis compared to the second quarter of 2019. Price/mix decreased 2% versus last year, primarily due to an organic decline of 2.6%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.8%. The lower organic price/mix was primarily due to COVID testing as the Base Business was relatively flat. Base Business price/mix benefited from esoteric growing faster than routine testing, but was negatively impacted by payer mix. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $516 million or 22.9% of revenue compared to $663 million or 28% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand while the company continued to main capacity. In addition, margins were negatively impacted by COVID testing payer mix. Base Business margins were lower due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Going forward, we expect the second half Base Business margins to be up year-over-year due to improved demand and labor efficiency. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign currency translation of 2.6% and lower COVID testing of 0.6%. Organic-based growth was negatively impacted by lower COVID-related work, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and lower pass-throughs. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenues grew in the mid- to high single digits. Base Business revenues compared to Base Business last year declined 2.3%, but was up 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Early development experienced good growth as did the clinical business, which was constrained by lower pass-throughs. Central labs was down year-on-year but up 6.7% on a compounded basis versus the second quarter of 2019. The decline year-over-year included the impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. We expect central labs revenue to be up in the second half year-over-year based on the strength of its backlog. Drug Development segment revenue was up 8.8% on a compounded basis relative to the second quarter of 2019 primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $213 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to $221 million or 14.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID-related work, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and inflationary costs. These impacts were partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. And in addition, personnel expense was lower due to cost reduction actions and variable compensation. In the second half, we expect top line growth and continued cost reductions to drive margin expansion such that the full year Base Business margin will be comparable to 2021. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.8 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our first half performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 2% to 6% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 50 basis points due to the change in currency. This guidance now includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 5% to 7.5%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 50% to 60%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 9% to 13% compared to 2021. This is an increase at the midpoint by 250 basis points driven by our updated expectations for COVID testing. COVID testing is now expected to decline 50% to 60%, while our Base Business is expected to grow 4% to 6%, unchanged from our prior guidance. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 4.5%, primarily driven by organic growth. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 1.5% to 3.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint of our prior guidance of 475 basis points. The decline includes 130 basis point change from foreign currency translation as well as the impact from lower COVID-related revenues and lower pass-through revenues. Compared to last year, the guidance range of 1.5% to 3.5% growth includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 230 basis points. This guidance also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 2% to 4% compared to 2021. Excluding lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis, the constant currency growth rate would be in the high single digits compared to 2021. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 9.3%, primarily driven by organic growth. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is now $19 to $21.25, an increase at the midpoint of $0.50 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is primarily due to the impact from COVID testing. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. In summary, the company had a solid quarter. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the remainder of the year, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline relative to the first half of this year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRivka Goldwasser: This is Ricky Goldwasser and Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. So Adam and Glenn, congrats for moving forward with elements of the strategic sort of program. Question I have is, as we think about sort of the clinical business, can you give us some context as to the margins that are associated with that business and how it compares to what's staying with sort of kind of like the core Labcorp or central versus early development? And then I have another follow-up after that.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. First of all, thanks for the question. And I'll give you some context, and I'll ask Glenn to give some additional context. The first thing is that the clinical development market is a very exciting market. It's probably about more than $25 billion in potential revenue. So it's a very large market, and it grows very quickly. And if you look at the business that we're spinning out, historically, it has about an 8% CAGR. And what we expect for the future is that it will have high single-digit organic growth. So it is a fast-growing business in a very large market. That's part of the reason we think it makes sense to spin it out at this time. When you look at the margins, we don't give the exact margin yet. And the reason why is because we still have a lot of shared services, and we have to break out those shared services to understand what the full margin picture will look like. Historically, what we've said is that we've seen margin improvement in that business year-over-year for multiple years now. And as we look to the future, and we said there'd be margin expansion, we've always said that the clinical development business has the greatest potential for additional margin expansion.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Adam, is that, Ricky, as you know, when we've done the enhanced disclosures, so we provide the full Drug Development segment, obviously, revenue down to margins. When we gave the enhanced disclosure of the 3 businesses that comprise it, obviously, clinical being one of them, we didn't provide the margins essentially for the reason that Adam had said, that we have a lot of shared resources. They're not necessarily stand-alone businesses. They're part of the segment. I think directionally, it's fair to say that when you look at the margins of the businesses, they all have different characteristics. And in the case of the clinical business, it is the one business that has, frankly, over 20% of its revenues that are pass-through revenues. So obviously, would constrain the margins of that business relative to the other businesses that wouldn't have that. But as Adam said, it's a very profitable business and a business that each year, we've seen margin improvement continue, and we expect that to continue going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Congratulations on the deal announcement. I might just ask you, in the Base Business, Drug Development, one of the things throughout this year is how the margin is planned to step up over the course of the year, and you had good margin improvement from, I think, 11.6% in the first quarter to 14.7% in the second. But you're also reiterating that you think you'll be similar to last year, which I think is 15.2%, implying further step-up. What allowed you to show the 300 basis points of margin improvement from first quarter to second? And what further gets you that back half margin improvement that's embedded in guidance?\nGlenn Eisenberg: It's Glenn. I'll start with that one. When you look at where we were in the first quarter, and the margins were low, and we kind of explained where they were. We felt pretty good that we made the comment that still for the full year, we would expect margins to be comparable year-on-year, in part because of the run rate where we were ending that quarter. So we did see what we saw towards the end of the first quarter. And again, came in margins now comparable to last year. Frankly, they would have been up compared to last year if you took out the COVID testing that we did last year. So as we think about the second half, we have still the expectation of continued top line growth, but also a lot of the cost reduction initiatives, LaunchPad and so forth, that was, call it, late in the second quarter. We're going to now get the full quarter benefit as we go into the third and the fourth. So between the top line, between the cost reduction initiatives that we have in place, similar to the end of the first quarter as we finished the second quarter, we're frankly at a run rate now that supports the higher level of margins that we would need to see in the second half to continue to believe that our full year margins will be comparable -- on a Base Business level, comparable to what we did last year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nTaji Phillips: This is Taji Phillips on for Brian. So just going back to your most recent news about the announcement of the spin-off, can you provide some color on your thinking and the strategy moving forward? Specifically, given that clinical business is typically a strong pipeline for central lab work, how do you see that dynamic playing out between the 2 independent companies after the spin-off?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you for that question. And as we look at the strategy overall, I mean, the reason it makes sense to do the spin and to do it now, it really is going to give strength and strategic flexibility and operational focus so that we can pursue the specific market opportunities and customer needs in each of those areas. The market for our laboratory services is different than that of the clinical trials. It gives us the focused capital structures and capital allocation strategies to drive the growth that we're looking for. And I think it also provides shareholders with more target investment opportunities. We are going to have arrangements between the companies that will enable -- that will enable us to make sure that the new business will have access to some of the data and the insights that we get from the diagnostics, which is a big part of the advantage that I think the Drug Development business has. In terms of looking at the central laboratory business, what's interesting is our central laboratory business, the vast, vast majority of our business comes from companies outside of ours. And in fact, it's only about 15% to 20% of the central laboratory business that comes from the clinical trials that we're running. So I think we actually will have expanded opportunities to do even more central laboratory work as we open it up and we're no longer only related to one Phase I through IV organization.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Big announcement this morning. So I had two questions for you. First is on the timing, why announce it today versus back in December? What's changed over the last 7 months? And then second, how did you decide where you wanted to draw the line? I see the rationale to hold on to the clinical testing piece. But specifically, I wanted to hear your thoughts on why it makes sense to hold on to safety assessment.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No, thanks so much for the question, Jack. I appreciate it. The first thing I'd say is we did the strategic review the majority of last year. And at the end of last year, in December, we announced 5 things that we're going to do. We were going to do a dividend, a large share buyback program, of which we'd accelerate part of that. We announced the LaunchPad initiative. We gave long-term guidance, and we also announced that we would have increased disclosures. And we gave time lines for each of those things. And I hope you see we met every deliverable that we committed to -- in the time line that we committed to. But importantly, in December, we said that we decided that the current structure was in the best interest of stakeholders at that time. And we were very clear to say at that time because we knew that post the review, the Board was going to continue to evaluate avenues to enhance value, including potential transactions. We were going to talk to more external people. At this point, we see strong growth in each of the businesses. So we feel really good about the business profiles. We've determined that a separation by spin will enhance value, but it's also going to give both companies the ability to get sustainable growth. And to me, having focused capital structures is really important because there's a lot of business development opportunities out there. And I think the way you prioritize those could be very different between the 2 businesses. And the last thing I would say is the COVID environment, if you remember, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year with Omicron was pretty dire. And we were very focused on making sure we could do all the tests we could, that we could do all the drug development studies that we were involved in, and it wasn't the right time for any type of distraction or disruption. So overall, we believe now is the right time to move forward. Second part of your question was, where do you draw the line? It's very clear that the laboratory business has a very different capital structure, equipment needs, very different needs than the structure for a clinical development business, which is basically people out on the street. And there's no doubt that when you think about having a global footprint for diagnostics, it will enable us to bring diagnostic testing around the world. The other thing that's important is when you think about companion diagnostics and personalized medicine, much of that is done very early in development. So as we think about having laboratory services, it's going to enable us to have a global footprint to do personalized companion diagnostics, which is becoming more important, and to bring that out around the world and has a very, very different growth profile, a very different capital structure needs and so forth. So we were very thoughtful and made sure that we're making very thoughtful decisions as to what we keep with laboratory versus what we spin out with clinical development.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I apologize if I missed this early in the conversation. I had a hard time getting on to the call. Late in the second quarter or as we kind of went into a quiet period, there was a fair amount of market chatter about some realignments going on within drug development broadly. I'd love to get your take on what exactly happened, reduction in force, compensation realignment, things of that sort. Is that included in the LaunchPad savings characterization? Or was there something more specific to drug development that was an additional action at the end of the quarter to help get the margin profile in line with what you were targeting?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you for the question, Eric. And sorry you had a problem getting on the call. We'll look into that. With regard to the drug development, we put the LaunchPad initiatives in place back in December, and we had a pretty strong understanding of what we were going to do. We did accelerate some of the LaunchPad initiative. But a big part of what we did in the second quarter was we realized that in central laboratory, we were not doing much new COVID-related work. And because of that, we were able to reduce a significant number of people, particularly those that were making kits by hand. And we had a lot of people doing that. I said before that we were keeping extra people in both drug development and in the diagnostic areas because we didn't know what we potentially need in the future for COVID. We've determined that for central laboratory, we do not believe we're going to have a lot of new COVID-related work moving forward, and therefore, we didn't need to have those people that were making the manual kits. So that's probably a lot of what you heard. As we move forward, we're going to continue to have other LaunchPad initiatives in place. A lot of those are about how we can improve efficiency and effectiveness, but also, we believe that we're going to continue to have margin expansion in that business as well based upon the run rate that we are at right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe just quick ones on the Covance business. Can you just talk generally about kind of the cancellation environment? It seems like it's been a little mixed this quarter across CROs. Are you seeing any uptick there? And then secondarily, in terms of the spin, will you guys consider kind of strategic options over the next year in terms of kind of selling it to a larger player? Or is it kind of set on kind of the tax-free spin?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you for the question, Patrick. And when you look at the RFP environment in drug development, it remains very healthy. And in fact, if you look even our central laboratory, we had a decline this quarter because of the COVID-related work. But we're confident in the growth in that business for the Base Business going forward because of the orders that we see and the book-to-bill that we have. So we have not seen an increased cancellation environment. We continue to see a very strong environment for all aspects of the Drug Development business as we move forward. With regard to the spin, we've looked at all the different options. And based on all those options, we believe a spin is the right thing to do. Of course, there may be other things that people come to us. But I think we've shown as a management team, we're open. We listen. We really analyze whatever comes our way. But based on everything we know, as we sit here today, we think the spin is the best path forward for really capturing both customer and shareholder value.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nKieran Ryan: This is Kieran Ryan on for Pito. Starting with the Diagnostics business. It looks like base margins came down again depending on what assumption you want to use around COVID margins, but your key competitor was talking about some margin contraction on COVID revenues due to a higher mix of retail tests as well as some reimbursement pressure. So I was just wondering if that's something you're seeing as well and then also just how you think about that retail channel opportunity and balancing those extra volumes with the margin side.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No, thank you for the question, Kieran. The first thing I'd say is we think the Diagnostic business is performing very well. The Base Business revenue grew 3.9% versus the prior year, and the Base Business volume was up 3.4% compared to last year. And the growth was coming from both routine and esoteric testing. In fact, if you look at the Base Business CAGR, it was 4.3% versus 2019. So you see good, strong underlying performance. When you look at the PCR testing, you'd see the decline. You saw a decline from first quarter to now. And in fact, we did about 31,000 tests per day on average. When you do less tests, it has some impact on the margin. We've also seen a payer mix switch. We used to have the uninsured firm, HRSA. We no longer have that. That was higher-margin business than the retail sector. We've seen more of our business move to the retail sector, where also it challenges our margins a bit. Margin right now for PCR testing is about 60%, but we'll continue to do everything we can to manage that. And we see the retail sector as an opportunity. But frankly, we're really focused on our Base Business. We're really focused on the hospital and the local laboratory acquisitions that are before us. And to me, that's the long-term growth that we see. So we'll continue to do what we can in PCR testing, but long term, we're really focused on getting that base business to perform well, and I think you've seen that in the quarter.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, and Adam commented that it's still at a very attractive margin. So we've commented in the past that last year, we were kind of in the 70% margin, so obviously very attractive. But to still be at 60% speaks to the fact that, one, volume levels are down, we continue to keep the labor force to make sure that we have the capacity because we don't know if there'll be future spikes. So obviously, from a labor efficiency, we're absorbing that. And obviously, as Adam said, too, as we do more in the retail setting, it has a mix. But again, as we look to the outlook for the year, and part of the reason for the improved outlook in our earnings guidance that we have is that we're actually performing more COVID testing than what we had expected, and that's why we continue to keep the excess capacity available for the unknown.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: I jumped on late, so my apologies if I repeat. On the -- can you talk a little bit about the embedded expectations on the current acquisitions you have, just what the M&A contribution is? And Specifically just on performance, have these been any bigger drag than you thought on the margin? Particularly thinking of the Personal Genome Diagnostics business as you sort of ramp that up and take that through. So just some incremental color on M&A contributions and just sort of like the margin impact that you see.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. I guess, first, to your comment, when we announced PGDx and also when we announced Ascension, which obviously hasn't closed yet, we commented that both acquisitions were very strategic and we believe would provide a very attractive return on our investments. However, both, especially initially, would be dilutive to our margins. So with the advent of PGDx having closed in part of the business, mostly impacting, even though it's spread a little bit across both of our segments, mostly into the drug development side, it does have a constrain on their margins. So as we think about margins year-on-year when we talk about that we expect margins to be comparable to a year ago, that's even with a little bit of pressure on the margin from the PGDx acquisition. Within Diagnostics, again, our margins -- most of the acquisitions tend to be a mix positive to us. The large hospital systems, especially when you're doing the in-hospital lab work, tends to put some pressure on the margins. So similarly, we would comment that for the year overall, Diagnostics margins would be relatively flat kind of from that base organic. But ultimately, once Ascension is closed and then goes into the results in Drug Development, you will see some pressure on the margins. So the way that we look at margins overall for the company is that this year, year-on-year from our Base Business margins, call it, organically would be, call it, flattish. They will be down a little bit because of the dilutive impact on the margins from PGDx and Ascension. But all the other acquisitions that we've announced and that are in the pipeline would be more of the traditional kind of tuck-ins even though there's still hospital systems that we have in there. But overall, with the outreach being a component of that, we expect it to not be a big impact on the return on our revenues. We have commented though that with the impact on EPS, really only PGDx was one that we acquired that we felt would be dilutive to earnings this year. Having said that, the other acquisitions that we were doing, Ascension as well as the others, would be offsetting that. So from an EPS standpoint, relatively neutral. From a margin standpoint, a little bit dilutive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So digging deeper into that earlier margin question, when Covance was last public and would split margins out, it looks like clinical and central lab combined for roughly 23% EBIT margins. So should we assume that central lab is materially higher and that clinical will also be around there given the expansion since then and the Envigo acquisition? And then also on the same side of that, should we also think about how early stage margin has expanded from that 12.5% EBIT margin level in 2014?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Again, when -- obviously, the acquisition of Covance was a long time ago and since then, a lot of changes from acquisitions to the growth of the businesses, Again, the reason we haven't broken out the individual components of it is the way we operate the business. It's integrated and a lot of shared resources and allocation of costs so that ultimately, when we carve out, if you will, the clinical development part of the business and make it a stand-alone business, we'll be able to give you exactly the profitability, the margins that will be there, and we'll actually do it going back for a 3-year period with audited financials. So I think what we're trying to say is directionally, you've heard us say that the clinical side of the business, while very profitable, is impacted by the impact of pass-through revenues, which, again, when we acquired Covance, we were under 605 accounting where over 20% of the revenues today, they would not have had in their margins. So obviously, that would constrain the margin. But again, very profitable, margins that continue to grow, and we'll be in a much better position once we do the carve-out financials and have it as a standalone business with the corresponding costs specifically related to that business. We'll provide it. But again, it's at an attractive level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair.\nMatthew Larew: Just a quick 2-parter on the spin. Maybe first, just following up to Rachel's question, given the close is targeted for second half '23, when do you think you might start to be able to untangle the web and disclose more in terms of the margin profile in that business? That's part one. The second part is, given market conditions and your strong balance sheet, the next year seems it might be an active M&A environment. Obviously, you've been active in the past year as well. Anything about your process to prepare for and spin the asset that would constrain capital deployment activity on either side of the business?\nGlenn Eisenberg: So I'll go ahead and start, Matt. So again, the timing to effectuate the spin, we're calling -- call it, look, the second half of next year and a lot of processes that you go through in spinning a company from -- obviously, we're going to make sure that it's a tax-free exchange. We're working with the IRS to again, doing the audited financials plus you're effectively standing up a company that has been part and integrated into an overall organization. I think what we've said at this point was we're announcing our intent to spin it strategically and that we will, over the course of effectuating the spin, continue to communicate and provide you with additional information as we have it that's really more relevant at the times. Once those decisions are made, once the accounting and the standup of the margins, I think, directionally, we've given you a good sense of where it is. The positive, frankly, from the company standpoint, especially as it relates to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet, a commitment to continue as Labcorp, investment grade with the same targeted leverage ratios that we've had before. We are below those targeted ranges right now. Obviously, we've been increasing the amount of our share repurchase program, and we've been increasing the amount of M&A that we've seen. So we purposely have kept a very strong balance sheet to continue to be able to pursue all of our capital allocation initiatives, including the initiation of a dividend. If you were to pro forma the company, even as if we didn't have the clinical business, we would still be within the, call it, the targeted range of our leverage right now. So it really speaks to the fact that we don't believe there will be a constraint on our ability to continue to pursue acquisitions for the -- for both companies as they're both part of Labcorp today. But when we stand up the spin company, while we haven't commented specifically on its capital structure other than to say both businesses will be well capitalized such that they'll be in very good positions to continue to pursue growth strategies, both through organic or internal investments as well as through acquisition opportunities.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: I apologize for earlier. First question, the -- I noticed a couple of things were larger this quarter. The unallocated cost or the corporate cost line was much higher than normal. Can you talk through that? And also the CapEx number grew quite substantially this quarter. Can you just talk through what drove both of those?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure, Kevin. First, on the unallocated corporate, which was up $29 million, if you will, year-on-year. We talked about there were 2 changes in kind of the methodology of how we're treating corporate unallocated on our prior call. So the first is that for Drug Development, part of its bonus that is tied to enterprise results is reflected in corporate unallocated or said differently, all of the incentive compensation for Drug Development that's tied to the Drug Development business is resident in the Drug Development segment. So that way, as you look at our Drug Development business relative to the peers, it's all related to that business. So that's part of the increase. And until that annualizes, you'll see an increase year-over-year. And again, the reason why it's a big number is, again, the strong performance that we're seeing within the enterprise, driven in part by higher-than-expected COVID testing. The other methodology change was really including in corporate unallocated our investments in oncology and R&D, specifically, that's not targeted or supporting current revenue streams. So it really had 2 impacts. One, so that it's now centralized, so we kind of manage and look at R&D as an enterprise, but also with the acquisition of PGDx, which has a high component of its cost structure, if you will, more of an R&D business than we've had historically. You also have the year-over-year impact because it was an acquisition. So those numbers wouldn't have been there. If you take those out, you've explained virtually all of the increase year-on-year. And I guess another way of thinking about just modeling going forward is that our unallocated corporate expense relative to, call it, Base Business revenues will be in, call it, 1.5% to 2% kind of range as an ongoing normal kind of environment. Relative to CapEx, we talked to -- it was a higher level of CapEx spend this quarter versus a year ago. We do expect that for the year, our capital spending, we normally talk about around 3.5% of our revenues on base revenues, is still there. So we -- quarter-to-quarter, there's always some timing differences that affect it, but we're currently on pace with our expected capital spend for the year.\nAdam Schechter: All right. So I want to thank everybody who joined us today. Labcorp continues to be at the forefront of science, innovation and technology, and we continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. As always, I also want to thank our more than 75,000 employees around the world for their tireless work carrying out our mission to improve health and improve lives. We look forward to talking with all of you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas, and good morning, everybody. Today, we announced we are pursuing the spin of our clinical development business, and we released our second quarter results. It's an exciting day for Labcorp, and we have a lot to cover. So I'll start with the spin. We are pursuing the spin of our clinical development business to shareholders through a tax-free transaction. This transaction will create 2 leading, independent and global public companies that will each be well positioned to innovate, grow significantly and enhance shareholder value. This announcement marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for our businesses and is a testament to our team's growth mindset, resilience and determination over the last several years. The decision to spin off the clinical development business resulted from our Board and management team's ongoing review of opportunities, including discussions with third parties, that best position us for growth, success with our customers and shareholder value creation. When we announced the conclusion of our strategic review in December of last year, we determined that the company's structure was in the best interest of stakeholders at that time. We reiterated that management and the Board were committed to continuing to evaluate all avenues for enhancing customer and shareholder value. We have now determined that spinning off the clinical development business is the best path forward to achieve this objective. The planned spin will position our businesses to thrive as 2 independent companies with greater strategic flexibility and operational focus to innovate, to pursue their distinct priorities and to better meet customer needs and capture growth opportunities. Each company will benefit from its own capital structure, enhanced investor alignment through a more targeted investment opportunity and a differentiated value proposition. Each will be well capitalized and positioned to generate substantial top and bottom line growth with strong free cash flow and attractive returns. We expect this transaction to drive significant value for shareholders as we'll provide investors with the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of 2 leading global businesses in the health care sector. This transaction allows Labcorp to move forward as a strong, global, innovative laboratory services business with significant growth potential. The Labcorp business will include routine and esoteric labs, central labs and early development research labs. In 2021, these businesses reported testing for 82% of the therapeutics submitted to the FDA, tested patients grew over 100 countries and performed over 650 million tests globally. Each is a leader in their respective markets. The combination of these businesses creates a cohesive global provider of laboratory-focused services with complementary resources, significant scale and a diverse customer base poised to grow in a global addressable market of over $150 billion. Labcorp's customers will continue to benefit from its deep scientific expertise, our innovative mindset, our vast health data and insights as well as our advanced global laboratory network. With a more focused platform for growth, we expect Labcorp will be able to capture upside as we advance innovations to deliver on our customers' future needs. Over the last 4 quarters, the lab businesses delivered total revenue of $12.7 billion or $10.5 billion excluding COVID testing revenue. These businesses grew at a 5.5% CAGR from the second quarter 2019 and the second quarter of 2022, excluding COVID testing revenue. Going forward, Labcorp is expected to deliver mid-single-digit annual revenue growth, and we remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. The clinical development business will continue to be a leading global provider of Phase I through Phase IV clinical trial management, market access and technology solutions, serving a broad customer base, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations. It will be positioned to compete and to win in a growing and dynamic market, including extending its leadership in oncology, cell and gene therapy, rare diseases and other emerging therapeutic areas. The clinical development business will be able to implement a capital structure that is tailored to support its growth strategy and enhance stakeholder value. Importantly, we expect the clinical development business will retain access to Labcorp's vast health and clinical data set through an arrangement to support clinical development customers with the ability to tap into Labcorp's unique data and capabilities. The clinical development business will be poised to capitalize on its innovation and technology platform to drive significant growth. Over the last 4 quarters, the clinical development business delivered total revenue of $3 billion. This business grew at an 8% CAGR from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2022. Going forward, the clinical development business is expected to deliver high single-digit revenue growth. We will have a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. I want to emphasize that each business has delivered strong performance, and we expect that Labcorp and the clinical development business will be poised for even greater growth as independent, more focused companies. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of next year, and we look forward to sharing more about its progress in the future. I'll now move to cover the company's second quarter performance and provide an update on progress against our strategy before turning it over to Glenn. The Base Business in the quarter continued to perform well despite ongoing impacts from COVID, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and foreign exchange rates. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.7 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $4.96, and free cash flow was $429 million. In Diagnostics, Base Business revenue for the quarter was up 3.9% versus the prior year due to increased demand for both routine and esoteric testing. The Base Business CAGR was 4.3% from 2019 pre-COVID, demonstrating strong, continued underlying performance. Drug Development revenue was flat in constant currency data in the quarter versus last year, with growth in early development and clinical development offset by central labs. Central labs was impacted by the significant slowdown in COVID-related work and the Russia-Ukraine crisis. On a CAGR basis, in 2019, pre-COVID, the Drug Development Base Business grew 9%. Margins in Drug Development improved in the quarter to 14.7% and are expected to continue to increase throughout the year. Glenn will provide more detail on our second quarter results in a moment. Now I'll provide a brief update on our efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and most recently, assist in the monkeypox outbreak. COVID PCR volumes totaled 2.8 million for the second quarter, averaging 31,000 per day. Time to results remained 1 day on average. With respect to the monkeypox outbreak, in collaboration with the CDC and FDA, we became the first national laboratory to begin testing for monkeypox using the CDC test. I'll now turn to progress against our strategy. In addition to today's announcement, we've made significant progress against our strategy by putting science, innovation and technology at the center of all we do. The company introduced multiple innovative and high-quality diagnostics to consumers and physicians in the quarter. We continued to expand our at-home test offerings through Labcorp OnDemand, including a first-of-kind blood collection device for diabetes risk screening. In addition, we launched an FDA-approved men's rapid fertility test. For brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, in July, we were first to begin offering a test that can help physicians diagnose conditions, including concussions, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Finally, we expanded our central labs kit production capabilities to improve delivery and address growing demand across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We announced the planned expansion of our central labs presence and drug development capabilities in Japan in collaboration with BML. Turning to oncology. We continue to deepen our leadership position by expanding our cancer-related diagnostic screening and testing portfolio and by partnering with our pharmaceutical clients. During the second quarter, we launched a new skin cancer test that give doctors actionable insights to help determine the best treatment options. The test is also expected to be used to support clinical trials. For patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, we're collaborating with Lilly and using Labcorp's OmniSeq INSIGHT genomic test to help physicians make more informed and personalized treatment decisions. Moving now to new and ongoing partnerships and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we acquired select outreach business assets and agreed to provide ongoing technical support to Prisma Health's hospital laboratories. We completed our acquisition of select clinical outreach business assets from AtlantiCare in New Jersey. We reached an agreement to acquire the clinical outreach business and related assets of RWJBarnabas Health, also in New Jersey. And the previously announced relationship with Ascension is progressing through normal regulatory approvals. We continue to have a very strong pipeline of health system and regional acquisition possibilities, and we look forward to announcing more in the future. In summary, we continue to deliver solid results, improve our performance and execute on our strategy to create long-term value for all stakeholders. We're encouraged by momentum heading into the second half of the year and by the strategic opportunity for Labcorp's growth and impact in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Sure. First of all, thanks for the question. And I'll give you some context, and I'll ask Glenn to give some additional context. The first thing is that the clinical development market is a very exciting market. It's probably about more than $25 billion in potential revenue. So it's a very large market, and it grows very quickly. And if you look at the business that we're spinning out, historically, it has about an 8% CAGR. And what we expect for the future is that it will have high single-digit organic growth. So it is a fast-growing business in a very large market. That's part of the reason we think it makes sense to spin it out at this time. When you look at the margins, we don't give the exact margin yet. And the reason why is because we still have a lot of shared services, and we have to break out those shared services to understand what the full margin picture will look like. Historically, what we've said is that we've seen margin improvement in that business year-over-year for multiple years now. And as we look to the future, and we said there'd be margin expansion, we've always said that the clinical development business has the greatest potential for additional margin expansion. Yes. Thank you for that question. And as we look at the strategy overall, I mean, the reason it makes sense to do the spin and to do it now, it really is going to give strength and strategic flexibility and operational focus so that we can pursue the specific market opportunities and customer needs in each of those areas. The market for our laboratory services is different than that of the clinical trials. It gives us the focused capital structures and capital allocation strategies to drive the growth that we're looking for. And I think it also provides shareholders with more target investment opportunities. We are going to have arrangements between the companies that will enable -- that will enable us to make sure that the new business will have access to some of the data and the insights that we get from the diagnostics, which is a big part of the advantage that I think the Drug Development business has. In terms of looking at the central laboratory business, what's interesting is our central laboratory business, the vast, vast majority of our business comes from companies outside of ours. And in fact, it's only about 15% to 20% of the central laboratory business that comes from the clinical trials that we're running. So I think we actually will have expanded opportunities to do even more central laboratory work as we open it up and we're no longer only related to one Phase I through IV organization. Yes. No, thanks so much for the question, Jack. I appreciate it. The first thing I'd say is we did the strategic review the majority of last year. And at the end of last year, in December, we announced 5 things that we're going to do. We were going to do a dividend, a large share buyback program, of which we'd accelerate part of that. We announced the LaunchPad initiative. We gave long-term guidance, and we also announced that we would have increased disclosures. And we gave time lines for each of those things. And I hope you see we met every deliverable that we committed to -- in the time line that we committed to. But importantly, in December, we said that we decided that the current structure was in the best interest of stakeholders at that time. And we were very clear to say at that time because we knew that post the review, the Board was going to continue to evaluate avenues to enhance value, including potential transactions. We were going to talk to more external people. At this point, we see strong growth in each of the businesses. So we feel really good about the business profiles. We've determined that a separation by spin will enhance value, but it's also going to give both companies the ability to get sustainable growth. And to me, having focused capital structures is really important because there's a lot of business development opportunities out there. And I think the way you prioritize those could be very different between the 2 businesses. And the last thing I would say is the COVID environment, if you remember, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year with Omicron was pretty dire. And we were very focused on making sure we could do all the tests we could, that we could do all the drug development studies that we were involved in, and it wasn't the right time for any type of distraction or disruption. So overall, we believe now is the right time to move forward. Second part of your question was, where do you draw the line? It's very clear that the laboratory business has a very different capital structure, equipment needs, very different needs than the structure for a clinical development business, which is basically people out on the street. And there's no doubt that when you think about having a global footprint for diagnostics, it will enable us to bring diagnostic testing around the world. The other thing that's important is when you think about companion diagnostics and personalized medicine, much of that is done very early in development. So as we think about having laboratory services, it's going to enable us to have a global footprint to do personalized companion diagnostics, which is becoming more important, and to bring that out around the world and has a very, very different growth profile, a very different capital structure needs and so forth. So we were very thoughtful and made sure that we're making very thoughtful decisions as to what we keep with laboratory versus what we spin out with clinical development. Yes. Thank you for the question, Eric. And sorry you had a problem getting on the call. We'll look into that. With regard to the drug development, we put the LaunchPad initiatives in place back in December, and we had a pretty strong understanding of what we were going to do. We did accelerate some of the LaunchPad initiative. But a big part of what we did in the second quarter was we realized that in central laboratory, we were not doing much new COVID-related work. And because of that, we were able to reduce a significant number of people, particularly those that were making kits by hand. And we had a lot of people doing that. I said before that we were keeping extra people in both drug development and in the diagnostic areas because we didn't know what we potentially need in the future for COVID. We've determined that for central laboratory, we do not believe we're going to have a lot of new COVID-related work moving forward, and therefore, we didn't need to have those people that were making the manual kits. So that's probably a lot of what you heard. As we move forward, we're going to continue to have other LaunchPad initiatives in place. A lot of those are about how we can improve efficiency and effectiveness, but also, we believe that we're going to continue to have margin expansion in that business as well based upon the run rate that we are at right now. Yes. Thank you for the question, Patrick. And when you look at the RFP environment in drug development, it remains very healthy. And in fact, if you look even our central laboratory, we had a decline this quarter because of the COVID-related work. But we're confident in the growth in that business for the Base Business going forward because of the orders that we see and the book-to-bill that we have. So we have not seen an increased cancellation environment. We continue to see a very strong environment for all aspects of the Drug Development business as we move forward. With regard to the spin, we've looked at all the different options. And based on all those options, we believe a spin is the right thing to do. Of course, there may be other things that people come to us. But I think we've shown as a management team, we're open. We listen. We really analyze whatever comes our way. But based on everything we know, as we sit here today, we think the spin is the best path forward for really capturing both customer and shareholder value. Yes. No, thank you for the question, Kieran. The first thing I'd say is we think the Diagnostic business is performing very well. The Base Business revenue grew 3.9% versus the prior year, and the Base Business volume was up 3.4% compared to last year. And the growth was coming from both routine and esoteric testing. In fact, if you look at the Base Business CAGR, it was 4.3% versus 2019. So you see good, strong underlying performance. When you look at the PCR testing, you'd see the decline. You saw a decline from first quarter to now. And in fact, we did about 31,000 tests per day on average. When you do less tests, it has some impact on the margin. We've also seen a payer mix switch. We used to have the uninsured firm, HRSA. We no longer have that. That was higher-margin business than the retail sector. We've seen more of our business move to the retail sector, where also it challenges our margins a bit. Margin right now for PCR testing is about 60%, but we'll continue to do everything we can to manage that. And we see the retail sector as an opportunity. But frankly, we're really focused on our Base Business. We're really focused on the hospital and the local laboratory acquisitions that are before us. And to me, that's the long-term growth that we see. So we'll continue to do what we can in PCR testing, but long term, we're really focused on getting that base business to perform well, and I think you've seen that in the quarter. All right. So I want to thank everybody who joined us today. Labcorp continues to be at the forefront of science, innovation and technology, and we continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. As always, I also want to thank our more than 75,000 employees around the world for their tireless work carrying out our mission to improve health and improve lives. We look forward to talking with all of you soon."

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Overall, the company performed well in the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3.7% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency translation. This was mostly offset by organic Base Business growth and acquisitions net of divestitures. COVID testing revenue was down 42% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 1.2% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 1.6%. Operating income for the quarter was $526 million or 14.2% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $66 million of amortization and $64 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisition and integration costs, facility rationalization and other LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $656 million or 17.7% of revenue compared to $840 million or 21.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%. The adjusted tax rate was also 24.7% compared to 25.1% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25%. Net earnings for the quarter were $359 million or $3.87 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.96 in the quarter compared to $6.13 last year. Operating cash flow was $572 million in the quarter compared to $487 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings and favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $143 million, up from $97 million last year, primarily due to timing. As a result, free cash flow was $429 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested $100 million on acquisitions, paid out $67 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of stock, representing 1.7 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 4.7% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 5.7%, partially offset by acquisitions of 1.2%. COVID testing revenue was down 42% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 3.9% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.3%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 2.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 3.1% partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.4%. COVID testing volume was down 45% compared to COVID testing last year, while Base Business volume grew 3.4% compared to the Base Business last year. We continue to see Base Business volumes improve as we're now up 0.6% on a compounded basis compared to the second quarter of 2019. Price/mix decreased 2% versus last year, primarily due to an organic decline of 2.6%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.8%. The lower organic price/mix was primarily due to COVID testing as the Base Business was relatively flat. Base Business price/mix benefited from esoteric growing faster than routine testing, but was negatively impacted by payer mix. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $516 million or 22.9% of revenue compared to $663 million or 28% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand while the company continued to main capacity. In addition, margins were negatively impacted by COVID testing payer mix. Base Business margins were lower due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Going forward, we expect the second half Base Business margins to be up year-over-year due to improved demand and labor efficiency. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign currency translation of 2.6% and lower COVID testing of 0.6%. Organic-based growth was negatively impacted by lower COVID-related work, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and lower pass-throughs. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenues grew in the mid- to high single digits. Base Business revenues compared to Base Business last year declined 2.3%, but was up 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Early development experienced good growth as did the clinical business, which was constrained by lower pass-throughs. Central labs was down year-on-year but up 6.7% on a compounded basis versus the second quarter of 2019. The decline year-over-year included the impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. We expect central labs revenue to be up in the second half year-over-year based on the strength of its backlog. Drug Development segment revenue was up 8.8% on a compounded basis relative to the second quarter of 2019 primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $213 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to $221 million or 14.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID-related work, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and inflationary costs. These impacts were partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. And in addition, personnel expense was lower due to cost reduction actions and variable compensation. In the second half, we expect top line growth and continued cost reductions to drive margin expansion such that the full year Base Business margin will be comparable to 2021. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.8 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our first half performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 2% to 6% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 50 basis points due to the change in currency. This guidance now includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 5% to 7.5%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 50% to 60%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 9% to 13% compared to 2021. This is an increase at the midpoint by 250 basis points driven by our updated expectations for COVID testing. COVID testing is now expected to decline 50% to 60%, while our Base Business is expected to grow 4% to 6%, unchanged from our prior guidance. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 4.5%, primarily driven by organic growth. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 1.5% to 3.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint of our prior guidance of 475 basis points. The decline includes 130 basis point change from foreign currency translation as well as the impact from lower COVID-related revenues and lower pass-through revenues. Compared to last year, the guidance range of 1.5% to 3.5% growth includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 230 basis points. This guidance also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 2% to 4% compared to 2021. Excluding lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis, the constant currency growth rate would be in the high single digits compared to 2021. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 9.3%, primarily driven by organic growth. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is now $19 to $21.25, an increase at the midpoint of $0.50 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is primarily due to the impact from COVID testing. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. In summary, the company had a solid quarter. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the remainder of the year, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline relative to the first half of this year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Adam, is that, Ricky, as you know, when we've done the enhanced disclosures, so we provide the full Drug Development segment, obviously, revenue down to margins. When we gave the enhanced disclosure of the 3 businesses that comprise it, obviously, clinical being one of them, we didn't provide the margins essentially for the reason that Adam had said, that we have a lot of shared resources. They're not necessarily stand-alone businesses. They're part of the segment. I think directionally, it's fair to say that when you look at the margins of the businesses, they all have different characteristics. And in the case of the clinical business, it is the one business that has, frankly, over 20% of its revenues that are pass-through revenues. So obviously, would constrain the margins of that business relative to the other businesses that wouldn't have that. But as Adam said, it's a very profitable business and a business that each year, we've seen margin improvement continue, and we expect that to continue going forward. It's Glenn. I'll start with that one. When you look at where we were in the first quarter, and the margins were low, and we kind of explained where they were. We felt pretty good that we made the comment that still for the full year, we would expect margins to be comparable year-on-year, in part because of the run rate where we were ending that quarter. So we did see what we saw towards the end of the first quarter. And again, came in margins now comparable to last year. Frankly, they would have been up compared to last year if you took out the COVID testing that we did last year. So as we think about the second half, we have still the expectation of continued top line growth, but also a lot of the cost reduction initiatives, LaunchPad and so forth, that was, call it, late in the second quarter. We're going to now get the full quarter benefit as we go into the third and the fourth. So between the top line, between the cost reduction initiatives that we have in place, similar to the end of the first quarter as we finished the second quarter, we're frankly at a run rate now that supports the higher level of margins that we would need to see in the second half to continue to believe that our full year margins will be comparable -- on a Base Business level, comparable to what we did last year. Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, and Adam commented that it's still at a very attractive margin. So we've commented in the past that last year, we were kind of in the 70% margin, so obviously very attractive. But to still be at 60% speaks to the fact that, one, volume levels are down, we continue to keep the labor force to make sure that we have the capacity because we don't know if there'll be future spikes. So obviously, from a labor efficiency, we're absorbing that. And obviously, as Adam said, too, as we do more in the retail setting, it has a mix. But again, as we look to the outlook for the year, and part of the reason for the improved outlook in our earnings guidance that we have is that we're actually performing more COVID testing than what we had expected, and that's why we continue to keep the excess capacity available for the unknown. Yes. I guess, first, to your comment, when we announced PGDx and also when we announced Ascension, which obviously hasn't closed yet, we commented that both acquisitions were very strategic and we believe would provide a very attractive return on our investments. However, both, especially initially, would be dilutive to our margins. So with the advent of PGDx having closed in part of the business, mostly impacting, even though it's spread a little bit across both of our segments, mostly into the drug development side, it does have a constrain on their margins. So as we think about margins year-on-year when we talk about that we expect margins to be comparable to a year ago, that's even with a little bit of pressure on the margin from the PGDx acquisition. Within Diagnostics, again, our margins -- most of the acquisitions tend to be a mix positive to us. The large hospital systems, especially when you're doing the in-hospital lab work, tends to put some pressure on the margins. So similarly, we would comment that for the year overall, Diagnostics margins would be relatively flat kind of from that base organic. But ultimately, once Ascension is closed and then goes into the results in Drug Development, you will see some pressure on the margins. So the way that we look at margins overall for the company is that this year, year-on-year from our Base Business margins, call it, organically would be, call it, flattish. They will be down a little bit because of the dilutive impact on the margins from PGDx and Ascension. But all the other acquisitions that we've announced and that are in the pipeline would be more of the traditional kind of tuck-ins even though there's still hospital systems that we have in there. But overall, with the outreach being a component of that, we expect it to not be a big impact on the return on our revenues. We have commented though that with the impact on EPS, really only PGDx was one that we acquired that we felt would be dilutive to earnings this year. Having said that, the other acquisitions that we were doing, Ascension as well as the others, would be offsetting that. So from an EPS standpoint, relatively neutral. From a margin standpoint, a little bit dilutive. Again, when -- obviously, the acquisition of Covance was a long time ago and since then, a lot of changes from acquisitions to the growth of the businesses, Again, the reason we haven't broken out the individual components of it is the way we operate the business. It's integrated and a lot of shared resources and allocation of costs so that ultimately, when we carve out, if you will, the clinical development part of the business and make it a stand-alone business, we'll be able to give you exactly the profitability, the margins that will be there, and we'll actually do it going back for a 3-year period with audited financials. So I think what we're trying to say is directionally, you've heard us say that the clinical side of the business, while very profitable, is impacted by the impact of pass-through revenues, which, again, when we acquired Covance, we were under 605 accounting where over 20% of the revenues today, they would not have had in their margins. So obviously, that would constrain the margin. But again, very profitable, margins that continue to grow, and we'll be in a much better position once we do the carve-out financials and have it as a standalone business with the corresponding costs specifically related to that business. We'll provide it. But again, it's at an attractive level. So I'll go ahead and start, Matt. So again, the timing to effectuate the spin, we're calling -- call it, look, the second half of next year and a lot of processes that you go through in spinning a company from -- obviously, we're going to make sure that it's a tax-free exchange. We're working with the IRS to again, doing the audited financials plus you're effectively standing up a company that has been part and integrated into an overall organization. I think what we've said at this point was we're announcing our intent to spin it strategically and that we will, over the course of effectuating the spin, continue to communicate and provide you with additional information as we have it that's really more relevant at the times. Once those decisions are made, once the accounting and the standup of the margins, I think, directionally, we've given you a good sense of where it is. The positive, frankly, from the company standpoint, especially as it relates to the balance sheet, we have a very strong balance sheet, a commitment to continue as Labcorp, investment grade with the same targeted leverage ratios that we've had before. We are below those targeted ranges right now. Obviously, we've been increasing the amount of our share repurchase program, and we've been increasing the amount of M&A that we've seen. So we purposely have kept a very strong balance sheet to continue to be able to pursue all of our capital allocation initiatives, including the initiation of a dividend. If you were to pro forma the company, even as if we didn't have the clinical business, we would still be within the, call it, the targeted range of our leverage right now. So it really speaks to the fact that we don't believe there will be a constraint on our ability to continue to pursue acquisitions for the -- for both companies as they're both part of Labcorp today. But when we stand up the spin company, while we haven't commented specifically on its capital structure other than to say both businesses will be well capitalized such that they'll be in very good positions to continue to pursue growth strategies, both through organic or internal investments as well as through acquisition opportunities. Sure, Kevin. First, on the unallocated corporate, which was up $29 million, if you will, year-on-year. We talked about there were 2 changes in kind of the methodology of how we're treating corporate unallocated on our prior call. So the first is that for Drug Development, part of its bonus that is tied to enterprise results is reflected in corporate unallocated or said differently, all of the incentive compensation for Drug Development that's tied to the Drug Development business is resident in the Drug Development segment. So that way, as you look at our Drug Development business relative to the peers, it's all related to that business. So that's part of the increase. And until that annualizes, you'll see an increase year-over-year. And again, the reason why it's a big number is, again, the strong performance that we're seeing within the enterprise, driven in part by higher-than-expected COVID testing. The other methodology change was really including in corporate unallocated our investments in oncology and R&D, specifically, that's not targeted or supporting current revenue streams. So it really had 2 impacts. One, so that it's now centralized, so we kind of manage and look at R&D as an enterprise, but also with the acquisition of PGDx, which has a high component of its cost structure, if you will, more of an R&D business than we've had historically. You also have the year-over-year impact because it was an acquisition. So those numbers wouldn't have been there. If you take those out, you've explained virtually all of the increase year-on-year. And I guess another way of thinking about just modeling going forward is that our unallocated corporate expense relative to, call it, Base Business revenues will be in, call it, 1.5% to 2% kind of range as an ongoing normal kind of environment. Relative to CapEx, we talked to -- it was a higher level of CapEx spend this quarter versus a year ago. We do expect that for the year, our capital spending, we normally talk about around 3.5% of our revenues on base revenues, is still there. So we -- quarter-to-quarter, there's always some timing differences that affect it, but we're currently on pace with our expected capital spend for the year."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chas Cook, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's first quarter 2022 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our businesses and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2022 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the general economic and market conditions, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to the change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we continued to advance our strategy through science, innovation and technology. We delivered a solid first quarter despite Omicron, which had a significant impact across both businesses in January and continue to impact drug development outside the US throughout the quarter. We remain focused on growth opportunities while continuing to take actions to mitigate inflation. In the Base Business, each month of the quarter was progressively better than the previous one. This positions us well for continued success throughout the year. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.9 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.11 and free cash flow was $239 million. Diagnostics Base Business volume increased 4.4% versus last year as both routine and esoteric testing saw a significant uptick after an initial slowdown in January. In Drug Development, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.23 on a trailing 12 month basis. Our backlog increased to $15.2 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. COVID-related vaccine work was lower versus a year ago across the segment, with the largest impact in clinical trial testing solutions, or CTTS, which primarily consists of our central laboratories operations. While we continue to see some impact from Omicron and the conflict in Ukraine throughout the quarter, overall Drug Development recovered nicely in March, giving us confidence in our 2022 performance and guidance. Turning now to COVID-19. Our PCR volume was approximately 70,000 per day for the quarter. Testing rates have since declined and we expect the decline to continue for the remainder of the year. Time to results for COVID PCR tests is currently one day on average. We are maintaining our ability to process 300,000 PCR tests per day, pending supplies and labor, to help the country remain prepared for potential new waves of infections or new variants as a public health emergency persists. I'll now highlight examples of progress on our strategy. In oncology, we are fortifying our leadership position by harnessing the scope and the scale of our comprehensive capabilities. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of PGDx, and the integration is going smoothly. PGDx's portfolio of liquid biopsy and tissue-based products enhances our leading oncology capabilities and puts us at the forefront of helping to drive better outcomes for people with cancer. We believe that PGDx's kitted solutions will allow Labcorp to expand genomic profiling globally and help our pharmaceutical clients identify more personalized treatments for patients. In addition, we recently announced new collaboration with Xcell Biosciences to advance the development of cell and gene therapy research. This follows our previous investment in company and is designed to help clients more effectively bring innovative cell and gene therapies to market. Next, Labcorp continues to intensify its customer focus and embed data and digitalization throughout the business. In February, we launched our innovative Labcorp on-demand digital health platform. We have a pipeline of tests focused on preventive wellness and health monitoring, women's health and family planning and men's health, and we plan to add to those throughout the year. Separately, we introduced a new risk scoring task this quarter for people with advanced liver fibrosis due to NASH. This test helps provide an assessment of the risk of liver disease progression and allows for earlier intervention that can support better patient outcomes. And we became the first US commercial laboratory to offer quantitative tests for detecting and measuring unintentional gluten consumption, which can help with the management of celiac disease. Labcorp continues to be committed to pursuing short- and long-term high-growth opportunities. During the quarter, we entered into and expanded several strategic relationships with hospitals and health systems. Last month, we announced our strategic relationship with Prisma Health, the largest health system in South Carolina. As a part of the arrangement, Labcorp agreed to acquire select outreach business assets and provide ongoing technical support to their hospital laboratories. This allows us to offer Prisma's patients and providers the benefit of enhanced care across multiple pinnacle areas. We also expanded our relationship with AtlantiCare in New Jersey in the quarter by agreeing to acquire select assets of the organization's clinical outreach business. In addition, we've agreed to purchase the outreach business of St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi. This builds on our 2020 acquisition of the outreach program of Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System. As I previously reported in February, we entered into a comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension, one of the US health care's largest systems. The long-term relationship will include our management of hospital labs in 10 states as well as the purchase of select outreach laboratory business assets, and we continue to make progress on planning efforts for this collaboration. As expected, these transactions are scheduled to close later this year. Our pipeline of acquisition and investment targets remains robust, and that should result in a very active 2022. We're committed to investing in our employees and continuing to operate responsibly so that we can provide the highest quality services to patients and to customers. We recently issued our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report, which offers insight into the following: our practices and processes to manage our company with integrity; our sustainability journey, including our pursuit of a science-based target to reduce carbon emissions; our commitment to provide employees with an environment in which they can thrive; and our efforts to help address the world's most pressing health care challenges in the communities where we live and work. The report is available through our Investor Relations Web site, and I'd encourage you to read it to better understand Labcorp's progress and commitments in these important areas. In addition, we continue to take other actions designed to enhance shareholder value. This quarter, we are providing additional information about the quarterly revenue contribution of each Drug Development business unit. And earlier this month, Labcorp initiated a quarterly dividend and announced a cash dividend of $0.72 per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of this year. To sum up, our Base Business continued its recovery across Diagnostics and Drug Development progressively in the quarter despite some headwinds. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, and our current momentum in the Base Business combined with our recent hospital systems, business development announcements sets us up well for success throughout the year. So with that, Glenn will take you through the details of our first quarter results.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations Web site. Revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 6.3% compared to last year due to lower organic revenue as the negative impact from foreign currency translation was offset by acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 43% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 4.5% compared to the Base Business last year. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million or 17.6% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $67 million of amortization and $39 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $794 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 28.4% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 23.4% compared to 24.5% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and stock compensation. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform. Net earnings for the quarter were $492 million or $5.23 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.11 in the quarter compared to $8.79 last year. Operating cash flow was $356 million in the quarter compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, primarily impacted by COVID testing and higher working capital requirements, which were mostly timing-related. Capital expenditures totaled $117 million compared to $95 million last year. As a result, free cash flow was $239 million in the quarter. We continue to expect to generate between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year. During the quarter, we invested $455 million on acquisitions. We were also in the market repurchasing approximately 600,000 shares as part of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed April 1. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Now I'll review our segment performance. Given the enterprise-wide strategic focus on oncology, we are reclassifying our oncology investments in R&D spending. These investments that are not supporting current revenue are being reclassified from our segments to corporate unallocated. This represented $4 million of corporate unallocated expense in the quarter. In our supplemental deck, we have also included additional business information for both segments. For Diagnostics, we provided a breakout of Base Business esoteric versus routine testing revenue as well as payer mix. For Drug Development, we included revenues for its three businesses: early development, or ED; clinical trial testing solutions, or CTTS; and clinical development and commercialization services, or CDCS. In addition, we've provided quarterly book-to-bill, quarterly net orders and pass throughs. I'll begin the segment review with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 11% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 11.5%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5%. COVID testing revenue was down 43% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 5.6% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 3.7%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 5% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 5.3%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%. COVID testing volume was down 38% compared to COVID testing last year, while Base Business volume grew 4.4% compared to the Base Business last year. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, Base Business volume levels were relatively flat as the decline we experienced in January due to Omicron rebounded in February and in March. Price/mix decreased 6% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 6.3%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.2% and organic Base Business growth of 0.1%. Base Business price/mix was up 1.2% compared to the Base Business last year, benefiting from an increase in test per session, esoteric testing growing faster than routine testing and acquisitions. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $683 million or 27.8% of revenue compared to $992 million or 36% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand while the company continued to maintain capacity. Base Business margins were down slightly due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Now I\u2019ll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 1.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 4.3% and acquisitions net of divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by lower COVID testing of 1.7% and foreign currency translation of 1.2%. Base Business revenue compared to Base Business last year grew 3.3% or 4.5% on a constant currency basis. The growth was led by ED. We also experienced good growth in CDCS, although constrained by Omicron and the conflict in Ukraine. CTTS was relatively flat as traditional Base Business growth was offset by lower COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic work as well as the conflict in Ukraine. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Drug Development, Base Business revenue was 10.7%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $169 million or 11.6% of revenue compared to $234 million or 16.3% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower COVID testing, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work, the impact from the conflict in Ukraine, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, which were partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. While margins were down in the quarter, we continue to expect margins to be up for the full year compared to 2021 as the segment benefits from top line growth, targeted price increases and LaunchPad savings. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our solid first quarter performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 1.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. This is a narrowing of the prior range, with the midpoint growth rate increasing 50 basis points. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 8% to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 70%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 11.5% to 15.5% compared to 2021. This is a narrowing of the prior range and an increase at the midpoint by 100 basis points. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 4% to 6%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 70%. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.5%, primarily driven by organic growth. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 6% to 8.5% compared to 2021. This is a reduction at the midpoint of 100 basis points, primarily due to the 70 basis point change in foreign currency translation from the prior guidance. In addition, the guidance change reflects the conflict in Ukraine, which was partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of PGDx. This guidance range of 6% to 8.5% growth over last year includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 110 basis points compared to last year. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 6.5% to 9% compared to 2021. We expect to benefit from growth in all three businesses, led by ED and CDCS. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11%, primarily driven by organic growth. For adjusted EPS, we are narrowing our guidance range and increasing the midpoint by $0.38 compared to the prior guidance. Our guidance range is now $18.25 to $21. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations Web site a view of our 2022 first quarter results and full year guidance compared to our 2019 results. In summary, the company had another quarter of solid performance. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the remainder of the year, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and our newly initiated dividend. Operator, we will now take questions. Operator?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is , on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question and nice job on the quarter. So as I look at this, acknowledging some of the specific headwinds and appreciate all the color you gave around the numbers for Covance. When we look at it, can you just give us a little more color on how we think about the progression there throughout the year? And can you remind us on -- large pharma has been a point of focus for you in addition to oncology. Can you remind us of exposure there and how that might impact growth rates beyond '22?\nAdam Schechter: So a few things. If you look at the business in general for our Drug Development, we had a good quarter despite some of the headwinds that we knew were occurring. So back in February, you may recall, we discussed that we expected the first quarter to be the toughest because we already have seen some impact from Omicron, and we saw it in both our Drug Development and our Diagnostics business. But the good news is that each month of the quarter got progressively better for both of the businesses. And the interesting thing is if you look at the impact, it impacted parts of our business differently. So for example, our CTTS or our central laboratory business was the most impacted by Omicron, and we saw it there first. And then for Drug Development, we saw -- for Diagnostics, we saw the impact, obviously, in the United States where our business is and that went away very quickly. After January, we saw the Base Business and Diagnostics bounce back very fast. Drug Development, CTTS, was a little bit different because it's a global business, and we saw continued impact from Omicron in parts of Europe. And then as we got to the end of the quarter, we saw some due to Ukraine. As we look at the rest of the year, we're confident because as we looked at March, we saw strength versus January. We saw strength in March versus February and we're on a good run rate now. We believe that there'll be some continued impact from Ukraine in particular in the second quarter. So the second quarter will be a little bit more difficult in the third and fourth quarter, but we expect to continue to see progress as we go through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: So I have a couple of questions on the Drug Development business. The first is on margins. So understand some of the pressures you talked about at the start of the year. But when I look at some of the peer reports so far this earnings season, it does look like your Drug Development margin pressure was more pronounced than others have reported. So was curious to get your thought as to what might have been unique to the Labcorp business that drove kind of more pressure than others.\nAdam Schechter: As I mentioned this before, we saw some of that pressure starting in the beginning of the year. When we were here in February, we mentioned that. But we have a very large CTTS business, central laboratory business, larger than most others. And we saw the largest impact from Omicron in that business. And I'll give you two examples. One is, if you look at our CTTS, central laboratory business, you saw that the growth rate for that business now that we're providing by segment growth rates, was less than the other segments. That's because we had such a strong first quarter of last year. We were prepared with Omicron to do as much central laboratory work as we did in the first quarter of last year this year, because we saw the impact of Omicron in December and January, and we kept as many people as we could prepared in case the boosters caused a huge amount of volume. It did not cause a huge amount of volume as the boosters came out this year. In fact, it was a lot less than what we saw with the initial vaccines in the beginning of last year. And then the second thing is we have a early development business, ED business, and we saw some impact on inflation in that business, particularly as you think about utilities and research and product costs. We're going to offset that with price reduction -- or price increases but also by cost reductions. And as I said at the beginning of the year, the inflationary pressures hit you all at once and it takes you time to LaunchPad to get the cost out. We saw improvements across all the businesses as we went through the quarter, month-over-month. So therefore, we are confident that we're on a good run rate as we're going through the rest of the year.\nJack Meehan: Sticking with Drug Development. Can you talk about what impacts the lockdowns in China may be having on the business? Just how are you managing your labs in the region? And has it impacted your access to large molecules -- or large models at all?\nAdam Schechter: If you look at our business in China, first of all, I want to let all of our employees know that we're thinking of them. We're here to support them and doing everything we can to help them. In fact, we have some employees that are basically living in the laboratories right now so that they can continue to keep the work going while the lockdowns are occurring. We have not seen a significant impact on our business due to the lockdowns at the moment but we're going to continue to monitor that very closely. It has not inhibited our ability to do the studies that we need to do at this point in time, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: So a couple of questions here. First on  and just kind of like thinking, you talked about kind of like these headwinds in the quarter, sort of COVID, Ukraine and then inflation. Can you just maybe either quantify each of these areas of headwinds? I think that's going to be really helpful for us as we think about it for the rest of the year. And then on the lab side, I think in the supplemental packet, you compare lab volumes to 2019 baseline, which is very helpful. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the core volume performance versus 2019 by market? I think  is down 50 basis points on volume 1Q '22 versus 1Q '19. If you can talk about what you're seeing versus baseline by market or on an organic basis as well.\nAdam Schechter: I'll start with the lab volumes, and then I'll ask Glenn to jump in with regard to some of the quantifications that you asked for. So with regard to Diagnostics, you saw revenue for the quarter was strong. It was about $2.5 billion. The Base Business revenue grew about 5.6% versus last year and then in a compounded rate versus 2019, it grew 3.9%. And if you look at our Base Business volume, it's up about 4.4% versus last year. But I think what's important is if you look at the volume versus 2019, you saw we were about flat. And as you may recall, Ricky, in February, we said that what we saw in January for our Base Business versus 2019 was down 8%. So that tells you the strength that we had in February and March in the Base Business and how we saw it come back so strong, which gives us the confidence. We really didn't see a difference between esoteric -- our non-esoteric business. We didn't see a big geographic change. I mean there are certain breakouts that were happening with Omicron in the northeast of the country for a period of time and then it might have moved to the Southeast. But nothing that I think is important for you know to note. I'd say overall, across esoteric, non-esoteric, across the regions, we've seen a very strong bounce back in our Base Business in February and March. And you see that by the fact that we were flat for the quarter versus 2019 when January was down 8% versus January 2019.\nGlenn Eisenberg: I guess just to follow up a little bit on that, too. So the 8% decline that we saw in January was not compounded. So it was the total decline. But as Adam said, the progression in February and March got us on a compound annual growth rate to be just down to 0.5%, so relatively flat with the expectation as we continue to go through the year. That obviously will become a positive number as we continue to experience the recovery there on a volume basis. So pleased with what we're seeing there. On the Drug Development side, quantifying, call it, the vaccine and the impact of Ukraine were probably the two more meaningful ones that impacted us for the quarter. From a vaccine standpoint, probably around $30 million of headwind from that. And Ukraine probably closer to rounding to around $10 million. So when we think that both of those primarily impacted the CTTS business, obviously affected others as well. But while we were, call it, flat in revenue on a constant currency basis in that business, if you backed out the vaccine related and the Ukraine, we'd be 7% to 8%, call it, organic constant currency growth rate, which would be more in line with what we would have expected the business to do.\nRicky Goldwasser: And can you just remind us, wwhen we think about the margin, it's kind of like a preclinical central lab versus clinical.\nGlenn Eisenberg: So we don't break out the margins for the businesses. As you saw in the additional material that we provided, we went out and looked, obviously, at our peers and what's provided and just looking at what additional information. And we felt the revenue breakout by business was important and beneficial because you get to see the magnitude that it is for each of the pieces as well as now tracking the growth profile. From a margin standpoint, our belief, and obviously, our peers that do similarly, look at it on a segment basis because there's so much that are shared assets between the businesses that we feel that providing it as a trend, if you will, on the segment is a more meaningful number. And then as you look at the growth rates of the different pieces, you can kind of get a sense of how we're leveraging overall in the businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I feel like we're falling a bit short on the disclosures on why the lab -- or the CRO margin is as poor as it is this quarter. I'm hoping we can get into some details on that. I guess the first question, you talked about early development having some inflation costs, and it sounded like maybe some research model supply access pricing issues. Are you at a -- suffering from being at a disadvantage for not having your own animal model business? Is that one of the bigger issues in early development that you don't have the same supply that perhaps some of your larger peers have?\nGlenn Eisenberg: And obviously, the 11.6% margin, obviously, it's down from where we've been. So when you look at the pieces of it, so the research product is a meaningful part of it. So we're incurring much higher cost for that. And so as Adam commented earlier, from a timing standpoint, we now have to go through change orders. But effectively, we believe that we can pass on those higher costs to the customers and a lot of contracts that's explicit with the research products to do that. So one of the reasons why we're constrained in the quarter was that higher expense without being able to transfer over. We also talked about utility costs. So just general inflationary, but wouldn't diminish as well just the impact from the Ukraine, from the vaccine. And also the first quarter historically has been a lighter quarter relative to how we end the year. And then each quarter, we pick up. So as we commented that first of all, our expectation for the full year continues to be that we'll see margins higher than the prior year. Our expectation, frankly, is that margin should be higher year-on-year beginning in the second quarter and going forward. And what gives us the confidence, and Adam alluded to this earlier, is that when you look at the run rate that we ended in March, even though we still have some of those headwinds passing on some of those costs, we're, frankly, at a margin level that gives us high degree of confidence even for the next quarter, but let alone for the full year that you'll start to see margins back to -- comparable to the prior year would hopefully up a little bit from each of the quarters as we go forward.\nEric Coldwell: And if I could just stay on the same vein and one follow-up, same topic, it's related to central lab. Obviously, shipping, freight transports gone up. I'm not sure to what extent you've been able to pass on those costs, but we also heard this morning from  that in their lab operations, they did have some supply component issues, more particularly around complex oncology components in central lab kits. I suspect you've faced a similar experience, but I was hoping you could give some color on that experience, what you're seeing. If it had an impact, how long you might expect that to continue if so?\nAdam Schechter: So if you look at the supply, there were issues in supply chain, I'd say, for the last six months or so, but we were able to find other ways to meet the demand in those kits, but it didn't mean at times there were higher impact to margins because, for example, if it's not a typical kit, you have to do some additional work to get it approved and sometimes you have to do those manually. So we were doing a lot more kits manually than we typically would, particularly if you have to put a replacement piece in there. But the good news is we were able to keep up with the demand from our pharma customers. We're able to meet their needs, which was important to us. But there certainly was some short-term impact as we're doing a lot more kits manually than we historically would do. And when you do more kits manually, then you put in more quality assurance where you check more of the kits to ensure if they're going out appropriately. So there is some expense that's incurred with that, but it didn't impact our customers. And what I would say, Eric, the most important thing to me is that we saw the progression in the margin month-by-month. We don't provide monthly margins, but we look at it very closely. So it's that, that gives me the confidence that we're on the right track and that we're able to meet the commitments that we've set forth.\nGlenn Eisenberg: And Eric, just one last thing on just the supply issue. What we've seen is because we run -- primarily have on a just-in-time inventory level within our CTTS, our central lab business. And obviously, when we started to see the global supply chain issues, it had an impact on us. We've now built up those level of inventories now for three to six months given the -- still the uncertainties of what's going on globally. So we'll carry that higher inventory to obviously make sure we can be focused on meeting the customers' demand and doing it efficiently.\nAdam Schechter: And having our Diagnostic business where a lot of the tubes and the things that you need are very similar, we're able to use supplies across the businesses when appropriate as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Noah on for Rachel. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the backlogs. And could you maybe provide any additional color on your current customer base and as well as your backlog and sort of the composure by end market for like pre-revenue biotech versus pharma companies? And then maybe any additional metrics that you can think of, of how we should think about that percent trending throughout the year and going forward?\nAdam Schechter: First of all, I'd say that the RFPs that are coming through are very strong. And if you look at our cancellation rates, they're very low. So we feel very good about the flow of business and the flow of RFPs and the flow of the trials coming. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was strong at 1.23. As you may recall, I say that we need to be at 1.20 or slightly higher and we remain at that number. And then if you look at our backlog, we have $15.2 billion, which was almost a 9% increase versus the prior year. Our net orders were $7.2 billion. If you look across the businesses, the breakdown by customer type is a little bit different. So for example, in early development, we have more biotech and smaller to midsized biotech than we do large pharma. If you look at our CTTS, which is our central lab, or CDCS, which is our clinical business, we tend to have more pharma than we do the small biotechs or the middle-sized biotechs. But I would say across the three businesses, we feel good about the RFPs that we're seeing. We feel good about the backlog that we're seeing. And we're confident that the backlog supports the long-term guidance that we provided.\nUnidentified Analyst: And you're seeing that sort of continue \u2026\nAdam Schechter: Yes, I expect that to continue, that we'll continue to have a strong book-to-bill that will continue to be above the 1.2 threshold that we anticipate to be. So I feel good about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jon, on for Derik. Appreciate the new disclosures, but I wanted to ask what your underlying assumptions are for the full year in your ED, CTTS and CDCS. We know that your early stage and late stage should be going faster than central lab. But yes, wanted to look into your assumptions there. And also in mid-April, FDA issued a warning about the possibility of false results from NIPT. I was wondering what sort of exposure you have there through Sequenom, that'd be great.\nAdam Schechter: So I'll start with the NIPT. It's a very small -- very, very, very small amount of revenue. It's a test that we do for screening and it's utilized in the United States, but it's not very large at all. So we'll continue to make sure that we have the test available, that we are making it available to physicians that are looking to use those tests, but it's not -- there's no impact in terms of our overall total business. With regard to the individual segments, we believe the fastest growth segment in revenue is going to be clinical, the CTTS -- or the CDCS business because we're not necessarily the market leader there and we have the ability to grow fastest there. If you look at the slowest growing business of the three, it will be CTTS because we are the market leader there. We have a large market share in that business. So there's not as much room for growth. And then the ED business is somewhere in between because we're number one to two. And then sometimes ED grows a little bit faster than the CDCS, and it goes back and forth.\nOperator:  We have a question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Obviously, a lot covered on the CRO piece. So maybe I'll ask on the lab side. Just on the COVID assumptions, appreciate the transparency on the range there. Can you just talk about the cadence through the year? Are you assuming kind of a bump near the end of the year around flu season? How are you thinking about that kind of as we go out even in the endemic phase in terms of seasonality? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to model that piece.\nAdam Schechter: As we said, for the first quarter, we averaged 70,000 tests per day. And by the end of the quarter, that was down significantly than where it was at the beginning of the quarter. And we expect there's going to continue to be a decline through the year. The reason that we give a range, and we've given a range of down 60% to 70% versus last year, is because there's a whole range of possibilities on how you can get to that range. So one of the possibilities is, as you say, there's a uptick in November around the flu season. But at that point in time, if there's not the emergency declaration, the price might be lower. If the emergency declaration continues, but there's not an uptick in November, the price would be at where it is now. So the bottom line is the 60% to 70% range that we've given has a whole bunch of ways that you can stay within there. My assumption is that the emergency declaration will continue through this year. We'll see if that occurs or not and I think volume will continue to decline throughout the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Adam for closing remarks.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Catherine. So first of all, thank you again for joining us today. I'm really encouraged by our progress and the important work of our more than 75,000 employees around the world. I can tell you they are our greatest asset and we're focused on supporting our employees that are facing additional complexities and difficult situations. We have people in Shanghai, Ukraine, Russia, and we're really making sure that we're thinking about them as they face these complexities. We look forward to speaking with you soon and we appreciate your time today. So thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we continued to advance our strategy through science, innovation and technology. We delivered a solid first quarter despite Omicron, which had a significant impact across both businesses in January and continue to impact drug development outside the US throughout the quarter. We remain focused on growth opportunities while continuing to take actions to mitigate inflation. In the Base Business, each month of the quarter was progressively better than the previous one. This positions us well for continued success throughout the year. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.9 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.11 and free cash flow was $239 million. Diagnostics Base Business volume increased 4.4% versus last year as both routine and esoteric testing saw a significant uptick after an initial slowdown in January. In Drug Development, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.23 on a trailing 12 month basis. Our backlog increased to $15.2 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. COVID-related vaccine work was lower versus a year ago across the segment, with the largest impact in clinical trial testing solutions, or CTTS, which primarily consists of our central laboratories operations. While we continue to see some impact from Omicron and the conflict in Ukraine throughout the quarter, overall Drug Development recovered nicely in March, giving us confidence in our 2022 performance and guidance. Turning now to COVID-19. Our PCR volume was approximately 70,000 per day for the quarter. Testing rates have since declined and we expect the decline to continue for the remainder of the year. Time to results for COVID PCR tests is currently one day on average. We are maintaining our ability to process 300,000 PCR tests per day, pending supplies and labor, to help the country remain prepared for potential new waves of infections or new variants as a public health emergency persists. I'll now highlight examples of progress on our strategy. In oncology, we are fortifying our leadership position by harnessing the scope and the scale of our comprehensive capabilities. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of PGDx, and the integration is going smoothly. PGDx's portfolio of liquid biopsy and tissue-based products enhances our leading oncology capabilities and puts us at the forefront of helping to drive better outcomes for people with cancer. We believe that PGDx's kitted solutions will allow Labcorp to expand genomic profiling globally and help our pharmaceutical clients identify more personalized treatments for patients. In addition, we recently announced new collaboration with Xcell Biosciences to advance the development of cell and gene therapy research. This follows our previous investment in company and is designed to help clients more effectively bring innovative cell and gene therapies to market. Next, Labcorp continues to intensify its customer focus and embed data and digitalization throughout the business. In February, we launched our innovative Labcorp on-demand digital health platform. We have a pipeline of tests focused on preventive wellness and health monitoring, women's health and family planning and men's health, and we plan to add to those throughout the year. Separately, we introduced a new risk scoring task this quarter for people with advanced liver fibrosis due to NASH. This test helps provide an assessment of the risk of liver disease progression and allows for earlier intervention that can support better patient outcomes. And we became the first US commercial laboratory to offer quantitative tests for detecting and measuring unintentional gluten consumption, which can help with the management of celiac disease. Labcorp continues to be committed to pursuing short- and long-term high-growth opportunities. During the quarter, we entered into and expanded several strategic relationships with hospitals and health systems. Last month, we announced our strategic relationship with Prisma Health, the largest health system in South Carolina. As a part of the arrangement, Labcorp agreed to acquire select outreach business assets and provide ongoing technical support to their hospital laboratories. This allows us to offer Prisma's patients and providers the benefit of enhanced care across multiple pinnacle areas. We also expanded our relationship with AtlantiCare in New Jersey in the quarter by agreeing to acquire select assets of the organization's clinical outreach business. In addition, we've agreed to purchase the outreach business of St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi. This builds on our 2020 acquisition of the outreach program of Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System. As I previously reported in February, we entered into a comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension, one of the US health care's largest systems. The long-term relationship will include our management of hospital labs in 10 states as well as the purchase of select outreach laboratory business assets, and we continue to make progress on planning efforts for this collaboration. As expected, these transactions are scheduled to close later this year. Our pipeline of acquisition and investment targets remains robust, and that should result in a very active 2022. We're committed to investing in our employees and continuing to operate responsibly so that we can provide the highest quality services to patients and to customers. We recently issued our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report, which offers insight into the following: our practices and processes to manage our company with integrity; our sustainability journey, including our pursuit of a science-based target to reduce carbon emissions; our commitment to provide employees with an environment in which they can thrive; and our efforts to help address the world's most pressing health care challenges in the communities where we live and work. The report is available through our Investor Relations Web site, and I'd encourage you to read it to better understand Labcorp's progress and commitments in these important areas. In addition, we continue to take other actions designed to enhance shareholder value. This quarter, we are providing additional information about the quarterly revenue contribution of each Drug Development business unit. And earlier this month, Labcorp initiated a quarterly dividend and announced a cash dividend of $0.72 per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of this year. To sum up, our Base Business continued its recovery across Diagnostics and Drug Development progressively in the quarter despite some headwinds. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, and our current momentum in the Base Business combined with our recent hospital systems, business development announcements sets us up well for success throughout the year. So with that, Glenn will take you through the details of our first quarter results. So a few things. If you look at the business in general for our Drug Development, we had a good quarter despite some of the headwinds that we knew were occurring. So back in February, you may recall, we discussed that we expected the first quarter to be the toughest because we already have seen some impact from Omicron, and we saw it in both our Drug Development and our Diagnostics business. But the good news is that each month of the quarter got progressively better for both of the businesses. And the interesting thing is if you look at the impact, it impacted parts of our business differently. So for example, our CTTS or our central laboratory business was the most impacted by Omicron, and we saw it there first. And then for Drug Development, we saw -- for Diagnostics, we saw the impact, obviously, in the United States where our business is and that went away very quickly. After January, we saw the Base Business and Diagnostics bounce back very fast. Drug Development, CTTS, was a little bit different because it's a global business, and we saw continued impact from Omicron in parts of Europe. And then as we got to the end of the quarter, we saw some due to Ukraine. As we look at the rest of the year, we're confident because as we looked at March, we saw strength versus January. We saw strength in March versus February and we're on a good run rate now. We believe that there'll be some continued impact from Ukraine in particular in the second quarter. So the second quarter will be a little bit more difficult in the third and fourth quarter, but we expect to continue to see progress as we go through the year. As I mentioned this before, we saw some of that pressure starting in the beginning of the year. When we were here in February, we mentioned that. But we have a very large CTTS business, central laboratory business, larger than most others. And we saw the largest impact from Omicron in that business. And I'll give you two examples. One is, if you look at our CTTS, central laboratory business, you saw that the growth rate for that business now that we're providing by segment growth rates, was less than the other segments. That's because we had such a strong first quarter of last year. We were prepared with Omicron to do as much central laboratory work as we did in the first quarter of last year this year, because we saw the impact of Omicron in December and January, and we kept as many people as we could prepared in case the boosters caused a huge amount of volume. It did not cause a huge amount of volume as the boosters came out this year. In fact, it was a lot less than what we saw with the initial vaccines in the beginning of last year. And then the second thing is we have a early development business, ED business, and we saw some impact on inflation in that business, particularly as you think about utilities and research and product costs. We're going to offset that with price reduction -- or price increases but also by cost reductions. And as I said at the beginning of the year, the inflationary pressures hit you all at once and it takes you time to LaunchPad to get the cost out. We saw improvements across all the businesses as we went through the quarter, month-over-month. So therefore, we are confident that we're on a good run rate as we're going through the rest of the year. If you look at our business in China, first of all, I want to let all of our employees know that we're thinking of them. We're here to support them and doing everything we can to help them. In fact, we have some employees that are basically living in the laboratories right now so that they can continue to keep the work going while the lockdowns are occurring. We have not seen a significant impact on our business due to the lockdowns at the moment but we're going to continue to monitor that very closely. It has not inhibited our ability to do the studies that we need to do at this point in time, Jack. I'll start with the lab volumes, and then I'll ask Glenn to jump in with regard to some of the quantifications that you asked for. So with regard to Diagnostics, you saw revenue for the quarter was strong. It was about $2.5 billion. The Base Business revenue grew about 5.6% versus last year and then in a compounded rate versus 2019, it grew 3.9%. And if you look at our Base Business volume, it's up about 4.4% versus last year. But I think what's important is if you look at the volume versus 2019, you saw we were about flat. And as you may recall, Ricky, in February, we said that what we saw in January for our Base Business versus 2019 was down 8%. So that tells you the strength that we had in February and March in the Base Business and how we saw it come back so strong, which gives us the confidence. We really didn't see a difference between esoteric -- our non-esoteric business. We didn't see a big geographic change. I mean there are certain breakouts that were happening with Omicron in the northeast of the country for a period of time and then it might have moved to the Southeast. But nothing that I think is important for you know to note. I'd say overall, across esoteric, non-esoteric, across the regions, we've seen a very strong bounce back in our Base Business in February and March. And you see that by the fact that we were flat for the quarter versus 2019 when January was down 8% versus January 2019. So if you look at the supply, there were issues in supply chain, I'd say, for the last six months or so, but we were able to find other ways to meet the demand in those kits, but it didn't mean at times there were higher impact to margins because, for example, if it's not a typical kit, you have to do some additional work to get it approved and sometimes you have to do those manually. So we were doing a lot more kits manually than we typically would, particularly if you have to put a replacement piece in there. But the good news is we were able to keep up with the demand from our pharma customers. We're able to meet their needs, which was important to us. But there certainly was some short-term impact as we're doing a lot more kits manually than we historically would do. And when you do more kits manually, then you put in more quality assurance where you check more of the kits to ensure if they're going out appropriately. So there is some expense that's incurred with that, but it didn't impact our customers. And what I would say, Eric, the most important thing to me is that we saw the progression in the margin month-by-month. We don't provide monthly margins, but we look at it very closely. So it's that, that gives me the confidence that we're on the right track and that we're able to meet the commitments that we've set forth. And having our Diagnostic business where a lot of the tubes and the things that you need are very similar, we're able to use supplies across the businesses when appropriate as well. First of all, I'd say that the RFPs that are coming through are very strong. And if you look at our cancellation rates, they're very low. So we feel very good about the flow of business and the flow of RFPs and the flow of the trials coming. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was strong at 1.23. As you may recall, I say that we need to be at 1.20 or slightly higher and we remain at that number. And then if you look at our backlog, we have $15.2 billion, which was almost a 9% increase versus the prior year. Our net orders were $7.2 billion. If you look across the businesses, the breakdown by customer type is a little bit different. So for example, in early development, we have more biotech and smaller to midsized biotech than we do large pharma. If you look at our CTTS, which is our central lab, or CDCS, which is our clinical business, we tend to have more pharma than we do the small biotechs or the middle-sized biotechs. But I would say across the three businesses, we feel good about the RFPs that we're seeing. We feel good about the backlog that we're seeing. And we're confident that the backlog supports the long-term guidance that we provided. Yes, I expect that to continue, that we'll continue to have a strong book-to-bill that will continue to be above the 1.2 threshold that we anticipate to be. So I feel good about that. So I'll start with the NIPT. It's a very small -- very, very, very small amount of revenue. It's a test that we do for screening and it's utilized in the United States, but it's not very large at all. So we'll continue to make sure that we have the test available, that we are making it available to physicians that are looking to use those tests, but it's not -- there's no impact in terms of our overall total business.

If you look at the slowest growing business of the three, it will be CTTS because we are the market leader there. We have a large market share in that business. So there's not as much room for growth. And then the ED business is somewhere in between because we're number one to two. And then sometimes ED grows a little bit faster than the CDCS, and it goes back and forth. As we said, for the first quarter, we averaged 70,000 tests per day. And by the end of the quarter, that was down significantly than where it was at the beginning of the quarter. And we expect there's going to continue to be a decline through the year. The reason that we give a range, and we've given a range of down 60% to 70% versus last year, is because there's a whole range of possibilities on how you can get to that range. So one of the possibilities is, as you say, there's a uptick in November around the flu season. But at that point in time, if there's not the emergency declaration, the price might be lower.

So the bottom line is the 60% to 70% range that we've given has a whole bunch of ways that you can stay within there. My assumption is that the emergency declaration will continue through this year.

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations Web site. Revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 6.3% compared to last year due to lower organic revenue as the negative impact from foreign currency translation was offset by acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 43% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 4.5% compared to the Base Business last year. Operating income for the quarter was $688 million or 17.6% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $67 million of amortization and $39 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $794 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 28.4% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 23.4% compared to 24.5% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and stock compensation. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform. Net earnings for the quarter were $492 million or $5.23 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.11 in the quarter compared to $8.79 last year. Operating cash flow was $356 million in the quarter compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, primarily impacted by COVID testing and higher working capital requirements, which were mostly timing-related. Capital expenditures totaled $117 million compared to $95 million last year. As a result, free cash flow was $239 million in the quarter. We continue to expect to generate between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year. During the quarter, we invested $455 million on acquisitions. We were also in the market repurchasing approximately 600,000 shares as part of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed April 1. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Now I'll review our segment performance. Given the enterprise-wide strategic focus on oncology, we are reclassifying our oncology investments in R&D spending. These investments that are not supporting current revenue are being reclassified from our segments to corporate unallocated. This represented $4 million of corporate unallocated expense in the quarter. In our supplemental deck, we have also included additional business information for both segments. For Diagnostics, we provided a breakout of Base Business esoteric versus routine testing revenue as well as payer mix. For Drug Development, we included revenues for its three businesses: early development, or ED; clinical trial testing solutions, or CTTS; and clinical development and commercialization services, or CDCS. In addition, we've provided quarterly book-to-bill, quarterly net orders and pass throughs. I'll begin the segment review with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 11% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 11.5%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5%. COVID testing revenue was down 43% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 5.6% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 3.7%, primarily due to organic growth. Total volume decreased 5% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 5.3%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%. COVID testing volume was down 38% compared to COVID testing last year, while Base Business volume grew 4.4% compared to the Base Business last year. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, Base Business volume levels were relatively flat as the decline we experienced in January due to Omicron rebounded in February and in March. Price/mix decreased 6% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 6.3%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.2% and organic Base Business growth of 0.1%. Base Business price/mix was up 1.2% compared to the Base Business last year, benefiting from an increase in test per session, esoteric testing growing faster than routine testing and acquisitions. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $683 million or 27.8% of revenue compared to $992 million or 36% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand while the company continued to maintain capacity. Base Business margins were down slightly due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 1.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 4.3% and acquisitions net of divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by lower COVID testing of 1.7% and foreign currency translation of 1.2%. Base Business revenue compared to Base Business last year grew 3.3% or 4.5% on a constant currency basis. The growth was led by ED. We also experienced good growth in CDCS, although constrained by Omicron and the conflict in Ukraine. CTTS was relatively flat as traditional Base Business growth was offset by lower COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic work as well as the conflict in Ukraine. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Drug Development, Base Business revenue was 10.7%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $169 million or 11.6% of revenue compared to $234 million or 16.3% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower COVID testing, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work, the impact from the conflict in Ukraine, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, which were partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. While margins were down in the quarter, we continue to expect margins to be up for the full year compared to 2021 as the segment benefits from top line growth, targeted price increases and LaunchPad savings. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our solid first quarter performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to decline 1.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. This is a narrowing of the prior range, with the midpoint growth rate increasing 50 basis points. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 8% to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 70%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 11.5% to 15.5% compared to 2021. This is a narrowing of the prior range and an increase at the midpoint by 100 basis points. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 4% to 6%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 70%. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.5%, primarily driven by organic growth. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 6% to 8.5% compared to 2021. This is a reduction at the midpoint of 100 basis points, primarily due to the 70 basis point change in foreign currency translation from the prior guidance. In addition, the guidance change reflects the conflict in Ukraine, which was partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of PGDx. This guidance range of 6% to 8.5% growth over last year includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 110 basis points compared to last year. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 6.5% to 9% compared to 2021. We expect to benefit from growth in all three businesses, led by ED and CDCS. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11%, primarily driven by organic growth. For adjusted EPS, we are narrowing our guidance range and increasing the midpoint by $0.38 compared to the prior guidance. Our guidance range is now $18.25 to $21. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations Web site a view of our 2022 first quarter results and full year guidance compared to our 2019 results. In summary, the company had another quarter of solid performance. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the remainder of the year, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and our newly initiated dividend. Operator, we will now take questions. Operator? I guess just to follow up a little bit on that, too. So the 8% decline that we saw in January was not compounded. So it was the total decline. But as Adam said, the progression in February and March got us on a compound annual growth rate to be just down to 0.5%, so relatively flat with the expectation as we continue to go through the year. That obviously will become a positive number as we continue to experience the recovery there on a volume basis. So pleased with what we're seeing there. On the Drug Development side, quantifying, call it, the vaccine and the impact of Ukraine were probably the two more meaningful ones that impacted us for the quarter. From a vaccine standpoint, probably around $30 million of headwind from that. And Ukraine probably closer to rounding to around $10 million. So when we think that both of those primarily impacted the CTTS business, obviously affected others as well. But while we were, call it, flat in revenue on a constant currency basis in that business, if you backed out the vaccine related and the Ukraine, we'd be 7% to 8%, call it, organic constant currency growth rate, which would be more in line with what we would have expected the business to do. So we don't break out the margins for the businesses. As you saw in the additional material that we provided, we went out and looked, obviously, at our peers and what's provided and just looking at what additional information. And we felt the revenue breakout by business was important and beneficial because you get to see the magnitude that it is for each of the pieces as well as now tracking the growth profile. From a margin standpoint, our belief, and obviously, our peers that do similarly, look at it on a segment basis because there's so much that are shared assets between the businesses that we feel that providing it as a trend, if you will, on the segment is a more meaningful number. And then as you look at the growth rates of the different pieces, you can kind of get a sense of how we're leveraging overall in the businesses. And obviously, the 11.6% margin, obviously, it's down from where we've been. So when you look at the pieces of it, so the research product is a meaningful part of it. So we're incurring much higher cost for that. And so as Adam commented earlier, from a timing standpoint, we now have to go through change orders. But effectively, we believe that we can pass on those higher costs to the customers and a lot of contracts that's explicit with the research products to do that. So one of the reasons why we're constrained in the quarter was that higher expense without being able to transfer over. We also talked about utility costs. So just general inflationary, but wouldn't diminish as well just the impact from the Ukraine, from the vaccine. And also the first quarter historically has been a lighter quarter relative to how we end the year. And then each quarter, we pick up. So as we commented that first of all, our expectation for the full year continues to be that we'll see margins higher than the prior year. Our expectation, frankly, is that margin should be higher year-on-year beginning in the second quarter and going forward. And what gives us the confidence, and Adam alluded to this earlier, is that when you look at the run rate that we ended in March, even though we still have some of those headwinds passing on some of those costs, we're, frankly, at a margin level that gives us high degree of confidence even for the next quarter, but let alone for the full year that you'll start to see margins back to -- comparable to the prior year would hopefully up a little bit from each of the quarters as we go forward. And Eric, just one last thing on just the supply issue. What we've seen is because we run -- primarily have on a just-in-time inventory level within our CTTS, our central lab business. And obviously, when we started to see the global supply chain issues, it had an impact on us. We've now built up those level of inventories now for three to six months given the -- still the uncertainties of what's going on globally. So we'll carry that higher inventory to obviously make sure we can be focused on meeting the customers' demand and doing it efficiently."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christin O'Donnell, Vice President, Investor Relations, please go ahead.\nChristin O'Donnell: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Labcorp\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com we posted both our press release and an investor relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, both of which are discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the recently completed spinoff of Fortrea Holdings Inc., the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies expected savings, benefits and synergies, from the launchpad initiative and from other acquisitions and other transactions and partnerships and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and our guidance for 2024. Labcorp delivered a strong finish to what was a transformational year for the company. Looking back, we executed well on our strategic priorities. We successfully integrated the lab operations of Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States. We completed the spin of Fortrea, our former clinical development and commercialization services business. We announced six new laboratory partnerships, reinforcing our position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories and we launched new innovative tests in our focus specialty areas across the business. As we begin 2024, we have momentum in both diagnostic laboratories and biopharma laboratory services. We expect to drive continued growth by expanding our base business, finalizing and integrating acquisitions and partnerships, by advancing our position in science, technology and innovation. We will continue to focus and lead in oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease, and neurology. Now, let's turn to the fourth quarter results. Labcorp performed well, driven by strong base business revenue growth in both diagnostics and bioparma. In the fourth quarter, revenue totalled $3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.30 and free cash flow from continuing operations excluding spin-related items was $422 million. Enterprise revenue increased 4% compared to fourth quarter of 2022, with diagnostics growing 3%, led by base business growth of 8% and bioparma growing 7% due to strong performance in central laboratories more than offsetting softness in early development research laboratories. Enterprise-based business margin was flat compared to the prior year despite being constrained by the mixed impact from recently closed hospital partnerships. Looking forward to 2024, we expect strong enterprise revenue growth of 4.7% to 6.5%. We expect margin improvement across both diagnostics and bioparma and we expect a adjusted EPS of $14.30 to $15.40, and applied growth rate at the midpoint of 10%. We also expect free cash flow to grow in excess of earnings. In a moment, Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 guidance. Turning to our enterprise strategy; in the fourth quarter, we continue to see positive momentum from our health systems and regional local lab partnership strategy. Labcorp continues to demonstrate that we are a partner of choice with several new health systems and regional local laboratory relationships. This is primarily due to our leadership in science and technology, our dedication to patients and our commitment to quality and efficiency. We announced a strategic partnership with Baystate Health in Western Massachusetts, to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets. We completed the acquisition of select assets from Legacy Health. Labcorp now manages Legacy's inpatient hospital laboratories, serving patients throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington State and we entered into an agreement to acquire Ambulatory [indiscernible] from Providence Medical Groups in California. Looking ahead, our M&A pipeline is robust and we remain focused on integrating and expanding our health system and regional local laboratory partnerships. These partnerships are typically accretive in the first year, with margins expanding over time during integration, and they return their cost of capital within just a few years. Turning now to our progress in science, technology and innovation; in the fourth quarter, Health [ph] by Labcorp, announced they will offer fertility and family building benefits. This benefit is the first of its kind that will allow employers and health plans to offer customizable solutions to employees and members to support their family building needs. Labcorp announced the availability of an ATM profile, the first blood-based test that combines three well-researched blood markers to identify and assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we announced the launch of the new FDA-cleared blood test for risk assessment and clinical management of severe preeclampsia. Labcorp and Hawthorne Effect announced a strategic collaboration to advance decentralized clinical trial capabilities for pharma, biotech and medical device sponsors. The collaboration is expected to increase patient diversity and inclusion to decrease site burden and to accelerate enrolment and clinical study timelines. Finally, for our Central Laboratory customers, we introduced a new sample testing application to provide enhanced near real-time visibility of specimens within the Central Lab. This phase is the first of many that will be launched for Labcorp customers. The application allows users to view events in the Central Lab's specimen sample journey for each assigned protocol and to customize how their data is structured. Turning now to the year ahead, we are focused on advancing our growth drivers that are outlined in our September 2023 Investor Day. We plan to continue to be a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. We will continue to develop, license and ultimately scale specialty testing, including Companion Diagnostics. We will work to bring our specialty testing to other parts of the world, which increases our global reach by leveraging our scale. For example, we're enabling our central laboratories in China and Geneva to perform liquid biopsy tests for clinical trials and we are well positioned for long-term success in cell and gene therapy and consumerism. We see tremendous opportunity for growth as we continue to focus on bringing new innovation, technology and products to market. In closing, 2023 was a strong and transformative year for Labcorp. We executed our strategy at exceptional scale and pace. I want to thank our more than 60,000 employees for their hard work and dedication to customers around the world. This enabled us to enter 2024 with considerable momentum that we intend to capitalize on to drive further value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives. With that, I'll throw the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. Going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2024 full-year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year, primarily due to organic-based business growth and the impact from acquisitions; partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 7.4% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 73%. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 5.2%. Operating loss for the quarter was $123 million due to an impairment charge of $334 million related to our early development research laboratory's business, as we've experienced soft biotech markets. In addition, we had $125 million of special charges related to acquisitions, COVID and the spin of Fortrea. Excluding these items in amortization, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $395 million or 13% of revenue, compared to $413 million or 14.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower COVID testing. Base business margins were in line with last year, as the benefit of demand and launch pad savings were offset by higher personnel and stranded costs and the mixed impact of recently completed hospital partnerships. Our launch pad and stranded cost reduction initiatives delivered around $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target of $100 million to $125 million per year. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.5% compared to 25.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings, and the benefit from increased R&D tax credits. We expect our adjusted tax rate for 2024 to be approximately 23%. Fully diluted EPS for the quarter was a loss of $1.95 due to the early development impairment charge. Adjusted EPS were $3.30 in the quarter, up 8% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $580 million in the quarter, compared to $607 million a year ago. The reduction in cash flow was due to lower COVID testing. Capital expenditures totalled $165 million in the quarter. For the full year, capital expenditures were 3.7% of revenue, and we expect this to be approximately 3.5% in 2024. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $414 million. The company invested $155 million in acquisitions and paid out $61 million in dividends. While we did not use any cash for share repurchases during the quarter, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program, which reduced our share count by approximately 1.1 million shares in the quarter. At the end of the year, we had $530 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. For the full year, free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related costs, was $888 million. The company invested $672 million on acquisitions, paid out $254 million in dividends, repurchased $1 billion of stock, and paid down $300 million of maturing debt. We continue to have a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities that will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. At year end, we had $537 million in cash with debt of $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.5 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now, review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year, with organic growth of 0.8% and acquisitions contributing 1.8%. The base business grew organically by 5.7% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 73%. Total volume increased 2.4% compared to last year, as organic volume grew 0.3%, which was constrained by lower COVID testing, while acquisition volume contributed 2.1%. Base business volume grew 5.2% compared to the base business last year, as organic volume increased 3.1%, while acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Price mix increased 0.2% versus last year, due to an organic base business increase that was mostly offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price mix was up 2.6% compared to the base business last year. Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $354 million, or 15.1% of revenue, compared to $387 million, or 16.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID testing. Base business operating income was up due to the benefit of higher organic demand, acquisitions, and launchpad savings, which were partially offset by higher personnel costs, including healthcare related costs. The decrease in margin was due to the reduction in COVID testing and the mixed impact from recently closed hospital partnerships, which we expect to improve over time. Now review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $695 million, an increase of 7.1% compared to last year, due to an increase in organic revenue of 4% and foreign currency translation of 3.1%. The 7.1% revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 12%, while early development was down 2% due to higher than normal cancellations. Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million, or 15.7% of revenue, compared to $95 million, or 14.7% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and Launchpad savings, partially offset by higher personnel and stranded costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.2 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Book-to-bill for the quarter was $1.26 billion, with the trailing 12 months at $1.04 billion. Now I'll discuss our 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 4.7% to 6.5% compared to 2023. This includes the favourable impact from foreign currency translation of 60 basis points. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 3.2% to 4.8% compared to 2023. The impact from lower COVID testing of around $130 million is expected to be offset by the annualization of acquisitions that were completed in 2023. We expect biopharma revenue to grow 5.5% to 7.5% compared to 2023. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency translation of 220 basis points. We expect central labs and early development to both grow within the segment guidance range. We expect margins in diagnostics and biopharma to be up in 2024 versus 2023, driven by top line growth and Launchpad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $15.40, with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of approximately 10%. While we do not guide the quarterly performance, it's worth noting that first quarter earnings will be below typical quarterly seasonality, due to weather disruption in January that we expect will impact earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 in the quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion, with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of approximately 21%. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to start with a question on capital allocation. So last year was obviously pretty active year for you guys, integrating Ascension, doing the spin. It feels like you have a little bit more bandwidth and the cash flow has been strong. I was wondering if you thought there could be any larger deals available either in the independent lab or health system space. Like I know it's tough to come up with something that's Ascension size, but what does the funnel look like?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, hi, Jack. So, if you look at the pipeline for M&A that we have, it remains very strong. As you say, there's not deals the size of Ascension necessarily in health systems, but there's quite a few health systems that when you add them up, obviously become meaningful. In fact, if you look at our longer term guidance, historically we've said that we'd have 1% to 2% growth from inorganic means. We have now said we believe it's going to be 1.5% to 2.5%, reflecting that we believe that there is significant opportunity before us. We also mentioned partnerships with regional and local laboratories, and I think that there could be some additional partnerships in that areas, but as I think about capital allocation in general, I first thought that we're committed to our dividend. We then look to do as many of these hospital, local, regional laboratory deals as we can do because they're so sensible to do. They return across the capital very quickly. They're accretive in the first year, and we know how to do them really well. And then if there's something that is strategic to us, and one of our strategic priorities, we would look to do those, albeit we're not looking at anything of massive size, but after that, we then look at our share buybacks, which we continue to believe is a good way to use our funds as well.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Jack, the only thing I'd also add to your comment earlier is that our guidance assumes that, again, we're going to generate between $1 billion to $1.15 billion of new free cash flow this coming year, and that we'll redeploy that for capital allocation of M&A buybacks and dividends, but the balance sheet is also strong. We ended the year at 2.5 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, and we have a targeted range of 2.5 times to three times. So to your point, if there were attractive opportunities out there on the M&A front, obviously share repurchases as well in addition to the free cash flow, we also have additional financial flexibility to pursue those opportunities.\nJack Meehan: Great. And can you talk about what, on the diagnostic side, what realized unit price was in the quarter, what your expectation is for next year and the reason I ask is, I get a lot of questions on the margins in the business, and it feels like we're in this elevated inflationary environment. Just like, what do you think, do you see opportunities to kind of use price more as a lever to offset that?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, so, Jack, let me first talk about margins just in general. So if you look at 2023, the margins were basically flat versus prior year. If you look at some of the things that we had to overcome, they were pretty significant, like COVID work that was significantly less this year than the prior year, but in addition to that, the hospital deals that we've done, in particular in the fourth quarter, had an impact on our margins, because although there are freedom in the first year, they're dilutive in the first couple of months as we do the integration until we have the ability to reduce costs to a level that makes sense over time. So we saw some impact from that in the fourth quarter as well. I feel really good about our margin accretion as we go into 2024 and we've said that we expect the margins to increase, but we also expect them to increase in each of the businesses, not just diagnostics, but also biopharma. Within biopharma, we expect them to be increased not just in Central Laboratories, but also in early development. So we continue to look for ways to reduce costs through a launchpad initiative. We're committed to reducing costs by $100 million to $125 million this year and each year for the next several years. In addition to that, our volume growth is helping us significantly. In particular, as we see growth in biopharma, that's going to help us with our margins. Despite the fact that we still have COVID overhang in 2024 versus '23, that we're continuing to improve the margins in our hospital deals, we're expecting to see the margins being accretive and growing this year, which to me is just a good sense of the underlying growth. With, particular focus on price, I would say price is net neutral when you look at overall price. There is some benefit to mix, and we continue to see mix helping us there.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Jack, the thing too, as Adam said, when you think about the Diagnostics business and the benefit, frankly, of seeing PAMA at least deferred out one year, that we expect the margins within diagnostics to be up in '24 all in, and that's even with the expectation that COVID testing is going to be down. Obviously, the underlying base business margin improvement would even be greater than that and as Adam said, the nice thing is with the growth that we expect, it's demand driven. A lot of it is the volume side. Price mix is still going to be favourable at a lesser extent than obviously the volume, but with unit prices being relatively flat, we have the opportunity, again to still see favourable mix to help, drive that improvement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: On biopharma, I just want to understand the expectations for margin there and how much of that is improvement in early development. I know you have sort of an easy comp in 1Q versus sort of actual improvement in margin and mix. Can you just talk about the dynamics of that and sort of the cadence of that as we think about the course of the year?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, I'll talk a little bit, and I'll ask Glenn to provide some additional context. Our Biopharma laboratory service business, remains a leader in both segments. We're a leader in Central Laboratory. We're also a leader in early development. Central Laboratory performed very well in the fourth quarter, and we expect is going to continue to perform well as we look at 5.5% to 7.5% growth in 2024 across the segment. But early development, we expect to continue to improve as we go through the year and we also expect early development to grow about the same amount as the overall guidance that we're giving for biopharma. A lot of the early development growth we expect will be in the second half of the year as we continue to see improvement and ramp up. Our RFPs look good in both segments. The largest segment, obviously, by far, is the Central Laboratories. The RFPs look good. Our win rate looks good. Big Pharma is continuing to send us a lot of RFPs that feel great. If you look at early development, the RFPs look good. The win rate looks good. What we've faced are some cancellations that are well above normal levels and we expect as we go through 2024 that, that will normalize and get us back to the RFPs and the win rate being positive for us, and therefore providing us with growth.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Kevin, just would add to that, when you look at the cadence, to your point, one, we expect Biopharma margins to be up year-over-year. Given the softness that we experienced, especially in the first half of 2023 with the supply constraints that we experienced in the early development in particular, you would expect to see the stronger part of the margin improvement in the first half of the year versus the second, but margins that would still be up year-over-year, even as we go through each quarter of the year and as Adam commented, that we expect margin improvement driven across both of our businesses. So we have early development and Central Lab both looking at revenue growth within that guidance range of 5.5% five and 7.5%. So on good top line growth, launch pad savings, we expect to see good margin improvement and to leverage that top line well.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. If I can ask a quick follow-up to that; just the outlook for NHP pricing and sort of your reliability of supply, how does the -- what's happening in the marketplace there? We've heard, pricing is coming under pressure a little bit. How does that -- how do you anticipate that helps or hurts on the margin front? Like how should we think about that impact?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So Kevin, right now, the supply is not an issue. We have as much supply as we need. I feel very good about, as we go through this year and into the future, we have multiple suppliers now. We've certainly seen some of the pricing come down in the market, which is a good thing for us because NHP cost is largely a pass-through for us. We pass the benefit on to our clients. So you might see the revenue come down for us because the cost is coming down, but it shouldn't have any significant impact. In fact, it can help us a little bit when it comes to our margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: So how would you characterize this general volume trends and utilization trends, relative to pre-COVID and just excluding COVID I knew, and if you also mentioned some of the weather impact in the first quarter, how big of an impact is that and how should we think about just volume dynamics as we head throughout the year in 2024? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Sure Erin. So first of all, I would say, we came into 2024 with significant momentum. The diagnostics-based business grew 8% in the fourth quarter. Biopharma grew 7.1% in the fourth quarter. So I feel good about the guidance that we're providing for each of those businesses. So for diagnostics, it's 3.2% to 4.8%, midpoint of 4% growth. Biopharma, it's 5.5% to 7.5%, and midpoint of 6.5% growth. So very strong revenue growth. We are comfortable also saying that there'll be margin improvement in each of those businesses. That's despite the fact that there is going to be an impact in Diagnostics from weather and we expect it to be $0.10 to $0.15 in the first quarter and, therefore, the first quarter will be the hardest quarter for us of 2024, but the numbers I just gave you and the ranges that I gave you, midpoints, already, we already know what the weather was in January. So it already contemplates what happened in January.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Erin, a couple of comments too as well that demand utilization is positive and frankly, we're kind of at the higher end right now when you look at it year-over-year. When with the guide of, call it again, midpoint of around 4% for Diagnostics, kind of organically next year, our normal historical call it two-thirds volume, one-third price mix is probably a good indication which still speaks to the fact that volume levels are up nicely. When you compare them to pre-pandemic levels, we're within the normal range where historically we would say kind of 1% to 2% from volume, one on the price side. We're within that 1% to 2% growth rate now, cater organically compared to 2019, kind of on the lower end, but well north of kind of 1% growth. So, we're at kind of a normal level right now, a little bit higher expected than historical and the weather impact that we saw in January, to give you kind of the rounded numbers, probably impacted our revenue by around $25 million and we incrementally, the drop down on that would be at around 60% margin. So call it around 15%-ish of operating income or that $0.10 to $0.15 range that we gave in our prepared remarks from an earnings manager standpoint.\nErin Wright: Perfect. Thanks and just your quick thoughts on sort of the regulatory environment as it stands now, whether it's LBT, PAMA and SALSA. Do you think PAMA just continues to be pushed out at this point? What are your thoughts there? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So, Erin, we continue to support SALSA, and we continue to be optimistic that SALSA will get passed. We have support from both sides of the aisle, and ACLA, our trade organization, is working really hard to get that legislation passed. If it doesn't get passed, then we'll try to see if there's a way to get another year's delay. In our guidance, longer term guidance, we assume that there will be an impact from PAMA. So therefore, we continue to say, if it's not this year, it'll be next year. If it's not next year, it'll be the following year. Until the SALSA legislation is passed, then, I'm not going to take a lot of comfort that it could be another year delay or so forth. We're going to really work hard to have that passed. With regard to LBTs, we do not support the FDA's kind of what they're currently thinking about in terms of taking legislation that was created for the device industry and applying it to the diagnostic industry. We were very supportive of that, and that was legislation that would give FDA oversight of laboratory-developed tests. We think that's the right path to go. We'll continue to work with the trade organization to see if we can make progress there, but we think legislation that is fit for purpose for the diagnostic industry is the right path forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could walk us through what's driving some of your diagnostics market growth being so above market, especially on the EPS side, because I've historically attributed some of your above-market growth to the extension deal, but I also thought about the lower margin profile. So I guess I'm a little surprised at this level of profitability bifurcation versus your largest peer.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, so what I would say, Stephanie is, number one, we have momentum in the diagnostics business and the momentum is coming from our base core business. We see it in both routine and esoteric testing. We have four therapeutic categories that we focus on that have higher growth in other specialty areas and we're going to continue to focus on those areas, oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease, and neurology and I believe that those are going to help us continue to grow because those parts of the market should grow disproportionately as we continue to go into the future. At the same time, there's no doubt that the acceleration of the hospital and local laboratory partnerships has enabled us to grow faster than what we've grown in the past and the good news is we have a strong pipeline of those as we go into the future. That's why we've raised the longer-term guidance for inorganic growth to 1.5% to 2.5%. Historically, we would have said 1% to 2%. So I think all those things combined give us momentum when it comes to the diagnostic volume.\nStephanie Davis: I understand. Looking forward to it and changing gears a little bit for the follow-up, could you dig a bit more into the Ovia announcement? How much of that was driven by inbounds from your existing employer clients versus the decision to expand into the market? And what does this mean in terms of investment lists in employer-facing sales or platform tech investments and the like?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So if you look at what we've done with Ovia, we think it's a terrific way for us to have a digital capability in a very important core therapeutic area that we're focused on, women's health. And it really is what they've offered a first of its kind fertility family building benefit that we will be bringing to customers. The service offers care navigation and concierge services that helps individuals throughout their family building journey. And, we can offer it directly to patients if they like. We can offer it to employers. We have a very strong employer group, Laboratory Employer Services and this is just one of many offerings that we're going to be bringing to the marketplace, but because women's health is so important and because we are so focused on it, this is just another avenue for us to help in the women's health arena.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on the biopharma booking side, the book-to-bill picked up a little bit from last quarter. I know last quarter you guys were flagging, maybe some elevated cancellations and on the emerging biotech side. Can you just kind of let us know what the environment looks like now? How you're feeling about that backdrop? Again, just given a little bit of volatility there and we've seen some biotech IPOs trickle out. How are you feeling about the backdrop and how should we think about bookings this year?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, absolutely and I'll start broadly about our biopharma business and then I'll talk about the individual segments as well. So broadly, we had a good quarter of $1.26 billion, which we said in third quarter we expected the fourth quarter to be improved and obviously it was improved. If you look at our trailing 12 months, it's about $1.04 billion and we believe that that's -- you want to be around $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion is typically what we're targeting. I feel confident we'll be able to get there as we go through this year. We dropped off a really strong quarter in the fourth quarter of 2022. If I break apart the businesses and we start with a much larger business, which is the Central Laboratory business. Our RFPs are very strong. Our book-to-bill is very strong. Our win rate is very strong. We're not seeing as many cancellations as we're seeing in the other part of business because it's focused more on larger pharma. Although there are some cancellations there, there always are, it's not nearly as large as what we're seeing in early development. In early development, I feel comfortable as we go through 2024 because our RFPs coming into us are still very strong. Our win rate remains good. I feel good about where our win rate is. What's happened there is, there's been a lot of cancellations. I think there's two reasons for that. One is I think with NHP pricing the way it was, some very small biotech companies that got in line just decided to say we're just not going to do it now and then I also think that there are other pressures with smaller biotech companies that they're going through financially. As I look at this year, I feel good about both businesses and in early development, we're actually even seeing a larger amount of our business come from large and middle-sized pharma versus early pharma or early biotech and I think as we kind of make that transition to get more and more larger pharma in early development, we'll be able to even have a stronger book-to-bill moving forward, but net-net, I feel confident in both of the businesses, the ranges that we've provided and where we are today with the book-to-bills.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Patrick, just one other thing to think through as well. Again, we had a strong fourth quarter, which obviously is very encouraging, but it was still driven more on the Central Lab side. So while the orders and the RFPs and our win rates for even early development are doing well, it's those cancellations that have impacted it. So as you think about the cadence too for next year, when you look at the biopharma, you expect to be kind of a second half-weighted year on the revenue growth. So both businesses, again, within that 5.5% to 7.5% growth, but because of those cancellations, we do expect to see early development growth rate be much stronger in the second half than the first. We're on the Central Lab. Given the continued strength of its backlog, we expect that normal cadence of improvement each quarter as we go.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple quick ones on the P&L for '24, Glenn, you talked a little bit about the diagnostics margins. Can you talk about what the COVID headwind is? I'm just trying to figure out maybe the core expansion versus the COVID headwind, if you have that and then just quickly, the interest expense expectations for the year and how you think about the debt load, addressing that at all during '24. Thank you.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure. Again, expect to see margins in both businesses that are up, but specifically in diagnostics. We do expect margins to be up in total diagnostics, albeit slightly up because of the impact, to your point, of COVID still being a headwind and the underlying base business margins doing well, but overall, we would say that we're going to be down around $130 million due to COVID. From a margin standpoint, call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points of kind of headwind that we're going to get. That, again, will be more than offset by the growth of the business and our Launchpad initiative. When you look at the interest expense, you can effectively take the run rate or where we ended the fourth quarter and kind of annualize that and then we do have around $1 billion of debt that's due late in 2024. So we're on $600 million in September, another $400 million in December. So we'll look to refinance it. The absolute debt levels that we have at that $5 billion, $5.1 billion, we expect to maintain. So we'll just refinance it, obviously, slightly higher rates than what will be maturing. So if you wanted to add 10% to the annualized number on top of that to reflect the refinancings at the end of the year, that would be a decent ballpark to be in. And again, the debt load from where we stand, we'll look for refinancing. We commented a little bit earlier that the leverage that we have as a company is still within our targeted range of kind of the 2.5 times to three times, but we're at the lower end. So obviously, we could potentially use additional leverage, additional debt, as we see potential other opportunities to deploy capital above the billion plus free cash flow that we'll generate this year, plus, we're sitting on a little bit of excess cash.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: So I guess my question, Glenn, as I think about the P&L lines, the cost of sales and G&A and factory and labor and obviously Launchpad, seeing that both of those lines outpace revenue growth in Q4, how are we thinking about the -- I hear you about margin improvement this year. So just curious, how you think about the labor environment and how that factors into driving margin improvement in terms of like actual dollars and the growth in those P&L lines?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, so no, Brian, we normally view, well, one obviously continues to be a tight labor market, but a market that's improved. From a nutrition standpoint, we continue to see improvement, but as a company, we're still higher than we were pre-pandemic and that varies across the segments because actually our biopharma is back to where we've been and we still see some additional pressure within the diagnostic side, but again, improving. Our general premise is that the labor market inflation for labor is around 3%, you can say 3% to 4%, but within that range. We've always commented that our Launchpad initiative was really in place to help offset that inflationary pressure. For us, a 3%, give or take, increase in our labor, call it merit in particular, would be a little bit over $100 million and again, we target that $100 million to $125 million a year. So again, we think things are levelling off, if you will, and that part of the margin improvement will be the Launchpad initiative to help offset those inflationary costs.\nBrian Tanquilut: Understand. And Glenn, maybe just housekeeping, maybe I just missed this, but share buybacks, how much are -- how much share buyback activity is based into the guidance?\nGlenn Eisenberg: So what we do guide to is that the free cash flow generation that we have will be used for share repo, M&A, and dividends. So it'll be across the board would be our expectation. We don't comment about how much is in each of the components, if you will, because it may vary based upon the acquisition opportunities that we see. But it'll be blended across and again, we commented as well that we have some additional balance sheet strength if we wanted to use that for additional M&A or buybacks, but the guidance that we gave and the earnings guidance, if you will, is reflected with all three of those capital allocation opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Back on the '24 guidance to diagnostic business, can you sort of quantify the margin improvements next year and any details on split between SG&A and gross margins and how much is coming from acquisitions and improving versus just pure organic improvements?\nAdam Schechter: I'll give some context on that, and I'll ask Glenn to add on. So if you look at the diagnostic business, I'd say the first thing is if you look at fourth quarter, you saw very strong revenue growth, about 8%. If you look at margin versus prior year, it was down slightly, about 30 basis points. What drove that primarily was that there were some minor things like increased health care costs and so forth, but it was driven primarily by the hospital deals that we did, that although they're accretive in the first year, in the first several months, they're typically diluted and we did several of those deals at the end of last year. As we come into this year, we're confident in the margin accretion for several reasons. One is obviously PAMA's been delayed. So that would have been a real headwind that we're not facing this year. We pushed that off into 2025. If you look at our volume increases, that's going to help us. The volume is going to be strong. If you look at the hospital deals, that we said extension would continue to give us some margin improvement over the next several years. Each of the hospital deals get a bit better as you go year-over-year. So we'll get some improvement from the hospital deals continuing to improve. We're also going to be looking to reduce costs across the enterprise, but a significant amount because of the size is in diagnostics of $100 million to $125 million and when you look at all those things together, we're expecting inflation to be about 3%, which is more than a typical rate than it's been in prior years. So if you put all that in, that's for our inflation of our people costs and so forth, should be around 3%, 3.5%. You put all those together and that's why we're confident that even though we have a headwind from COVID, that's fairly significant, about $130 million, we'll still be able to get some margin improvement in the diagnostic business.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, no, I kind of think that's right. Pito, that when you look this year as COVID becomes less of an impact, still an impact, it's kind of being offset by the acquisitions that we did late in the year. Really, it's the hospital partnerships and to your point, the margin is constrained a little bit when we do the in-hospital lab management agreements, but a typical M&A for us that would include hospital labs management tend to be more weighted to frankly the acquisition component. Ascension, as we've talked about, we called out one because of its sheer size, but also was disproportionately tied to the in-hospital lab. So less of an impact, a little bit of a headwind, but less of an impact. So it's really top line growth, cost controls, Launchpad business process improvement initiatives is really what's going to help drive the margins across both of our businesses.\nPito Chickering: Okay, great. And then back on for fourth quarter on the early stage cancellations, is it the color of why you saw that spike? Was that just a single customer or is that sort of a swath of customers? And why do you think that should normalize 2024? Thanks so much.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. And it wasn't specific to fourth quarter, although there was an increase in the fourth quarter. We saw it throughout last year and we think there were several reasons. One, when there was an NHP supply issue, people were getting in line to run their NHP trials well in advance of what they typically would. By the time it was their turn, they would look and say, you know what, we're not going to do that trial. Either they reprioritized the pipeline, they decided the NHP costs were higher than what they had budgeted for, they decided just not to move forward at that time. The second thing is the funding in smaller biotech has been more difficult. So they're choosing their trials very carefully in the compounds that they move forward, but as we go forward, we're seeing, the RFPs look good as well as our win rates look good. So, the cancellations we believe are going to normalize. We're also starting to see a shift in our business a bit more towards mid-size to larger pharma as some of the smaller biotech have had those cancellations. They have less cancellations typically than the smaller ones. So that's why we think, we're going to see improvement as we go through this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So I just want to follow up on that last question. So the shift towards mid-to-larger pharma in early development, is that really solely a function of this cancellation dynamic that you're seeing over the shorter term, because I thought for maybe one of your prior comments it seems like that was also maybe more of a strategic shift moving up market there. So any additional color there would be helpful. And then secondarily on the cost improvements in BLS, I understand what you're saying about the continued revenue improvement there. Are there any other sort of cost improvements as we move further away from the spin or should we sort of think about those cost opportunities as largely you've already done them and this is really just like an organic opportunity? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, sure. So as I came up with early development business, I've been saying for quite some time that we would like to see a shift towards more mid to larger size and I want to be clear, it's not significant. It's still more in the smaller biotech than it is to the mid to larger size. It's been something that we've been working on for multiple years now and we're seeing some progress, but also a part of it is that cancellations are occurring more often in the smaller biotech companies. So we were purposely moving that direction. There is a reason that we're able to move a little bit faster, but we still have work to do there. But over time, I would like to see that mix move more towards mid-size to larger format.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Elizabeth, also on the cost side for BLS, it's not only the growth, but there are cost opportunities kind of in the post spin environment. We still have stranded costs that affect our Biopharma business that we're continuing to take out and obviously that's getting wrapped in our overall launchpad initiative as we talk to the $100 million to $125 million of savings each year. We did take out a meaningful amount of costs that were stranded. We had talked about having a $25 million dollar run rate of cost savings in the fourth quarter, which we achieved. So we'll get the benefit of that going forward, but there's still opportunities to consolidate. We still have a little bit of excess capacity within our early development side of the business. So we're managing that cost and the capacity, leaving ample room, though, because of the expectation that we're going to start to see good growth in that business as well. But it's not only obviously top line growth, but still opportunities to take some costs out.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. And maybe just one quick follow up. Anything that you can comment on the expected 2024 tax rate?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So we've kind of guided that we think a 23% adjusted tax rate is reasonable for the company and what's interesting, if you think about Labcorp today post spin, we actually have a higher percentage of our earnings now that are generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions than we did when we had the clinical business. In addition, we have a higher percentage of R&D. So a higher percentage of R&D benefit than we did when we had clinical. So overall, while we historically have trended and seen our tax rate decline year-to-year over the last few years, the profile of the company gives us confidence that the 23% rate now is a sustainable rate, plus or minus going forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Good morning, guys. Of course, all of my self-proclaimed good questions have just been asked in the last couple of minutes here, but I'm going to dive into that last one on R&D tax credit. Can you tell us what specifically might have happened in the fourth quarter to drive what appears to be some additional upside and thoughts on legal or regulatory changes and in addition to Glenn's comments here about the geographic mix and the higher proportion of revenue associated with businesses that now would get an R&D tax credit, I'm just curious on how much of a sustainable impact this might be for favorable long term tax rates.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So, Eric, when you think about the focus of the company, one of the key areas of target is an oncology. And obviously with PGX, OmniSeq, other areas that we've acquired as well are more R&D driven than historically Labcorp was. So each year we continue to make more investments, more opportunities and with that increased investment come the tax deductibility of that. Obviously, there's still some pending tax laws that are out there right now, where you can advertise that benefit over a number of years. From a cash standpoint, we're kind of pre-funding it. So hopefully we'll get -- that will change and we'll get more. There's obviously the impact of potentially global minimum taxes that really don't affect us that much, given as we look at where, again, geographically we generate our earnings. Really not going to have any meaningful impact. So from a sustainability standpoint, we think that 23% plus or minus rate is a reasonable rate to go forward, but obviously, the more we grow, the more we grow internationally gives us an opportunity to structurally change that maybe a little bit more favorably as well.\nEric Coldwell: And Glenn, maybe education on my behalf, but are you seeing R&D tax credits on the CRO side as well, the BLS segment, or is it mostly or entirely associated with your internal investments in advanced diagnostics and LDTs, things of that sort?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, it's across the board. We have investments that span the entire company. I think the increase that we've been seeing that has been driving the more favourable amount has been driven more on the diagnostic side, but frankly, our oncology spans the enterprise. So everything that we work on and where we work on it and who's working on it, again, we would say is across the enterprise, but more weighted to diagnostics.\nEric Coldwell: Great. And if I could get one more in here, the stranded cost commentary, could you just remind us what you're sharing in terms of what those total costs were, how they phase out, and what happens at the end of 2024 when Fortrea, thinks they're going to be completing their biggest TSA transitions, particularly on the IT side? I'm just, what is the impact to Labcorp over the next handful of quarters and into 2025 as you face these stranded costs, but they start to come out, and then what happens at the end of the TSAs? Thank you very much.\nGlenn Eisenberg: No, sure, Eric. So from the stranded costs, we commented that we had around $45 million of stranded costs and that our initial target was to take out that $25 million at a run rate this year, which, again, we've achieved. So there's more to come. So in the fourth quarter, call it around a $6 million headwind that we had due to stranded costs that obviously impact margins. As we go forward with the TSA support, so what we're doing to support Fortrea, IT and other areas, that's effectively a pass-through, right? We're providing the service. They're paying us for that service. Once they're fully sustainable on their own and the TSAs would go away, our costs go away because, frankly, most of the costs are contract labor-related on the IT side. So when the job's done, those costs are gone overall, but we continue to tackle the other stranded costs as well. So when you look at it, the goal was, to have all the TSAs completed within two years. I can tell you Fortrea and Labcorp are both very motivated to see and incentivized to see that transition happen as soon as possible. The good news is that both are focused on it. We're making good progress. Fortrea is making very good progress and we would expect to hopefully see those TSAs expire earlier than what we had planned or at least what we had planned for, but again, the costs will go with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill: Thanks for taking my question. I first wanted to start with the guidance range. Glenn, can you help us understand, it's a pretty wide range. What's in the low end of the range and what gets you to the upper end of the range would be my first question. And then secondly, I just want to understand managed care contracting and pricing for 2024. You talked about volume and pricing mix, but just curious as to do you have many contracts that are up for renewal? Is there anything that's different when we think about contracting with managed care entities?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll take the second one first, which is, we feel confident in our contracts that we had put a few in place last year, but this year, there's no major expiration. So we feel good about where we are and there's not much risk in the guidance range as we go through this year and the next. But with regard to the ranges and certain things that go to the upper end of the funnel, obviously, the bottom of the revenue range, obviously, the diagnostic volume looks great and we're expecting that to continue. The weather is a bit of what's taking us a little bit back to the midpoint. So the weather is 10% to 15% impact, but the volume continues to be very, very strong. The rate in which we integrate the hospital deals will help us and we have very good track record of doing that. But the good news is there's not as much volatility this year as there's been in years in the past with COVID. So I feel good about the range. And in fact, the EPS range, we've narrowed it versus what that means would have been last year, the year before that, because there is less volatility and then I'd say in the biopharma services business, I would say that the strength we have and momentum is great. The thing that we're watching carefully are when the cancellations, in particular in early development, start to come back to more normal.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah. And Lisa, I think on Adam's comment that when you look at the profile of Labcorp now that we've spun the clinical development business, it has taken out some of the volatility and variability, if you will. So the guidance ranges really across the businesses and the enterprise are actually a little bit tighter than what we normally do. Obviously, we're just starting out the year. The midpoint, obviously, our guidance is our best expectation that we have, realizing obviously higher demand would promote more on the upper end or softer demand down below, but needless to say as we go through the year, we'll continue to tighten the ranges with less time left in the year.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Hey, good morning. This is John Kim on for Derek. I think a lot of the key questions I had have been answered, but I wanted to ask about the esoteric versus routine testing you laid out or you reaffirmed your focus on the four therapeutic areas and it seems like the esoteric had a pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. But going forward, can we continue to expect that high single digit, low double digit growth in the esoteric and then the rest of it would be made up in routine?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So if you look at the esoteric testing volume, we continue to have a significant focus on the four therapeutic areas that we talked about. And we did, in fact, see in the fourth quarter and the full year that esoteric testing volume grew slightly faster than the routine, but it's strong to note that both of them grew strongly and we expect them to continue to both grow strongly, but we would expect esoteric to grow at a slightly higher rate in both volume and the volume obviously is at higher dollars. So maybe a little bit faster in the dollars.\nJohn Kim: And then in terms of pricing, you mentioned that you're expecting mostly flat pricing in 2024. There are no major contract renewals coming up and PAMA has obviously been pushed out, but if I look at the margins between biopharma and diagnostics, biopharma had a pretty strong margin compared to the diagnostics in the fourth quarter and you mentioned that there's going to be a slight expansion in diagnostics. What's going to be the dynamic between the two for the full year 2024? Can we -- is the fourth quarter a good jumping off point for the biopharma margins?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, no, I wouldn't use any one quarter for the margins. We expect the margins to actually improve across the business, across both diagnostics and biopharma. Diagnostics in the fourth quarter was impacted to some degree by the hospital integrations that we're doing, that there were several new ones. And although they're accretive in the first year, they were dilutive in the first couple of months. We expect that to improve as we go into next year. As we go to next year, there's still a COVID overhang in the diagnostic business, probably about $130 million or so, but even with that, we expect to get some slight margin improvement in that business and overcome that.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. So in closing, I know we're at the end of the hour. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. I want to thank our team here at Labcorp for their focus and dedication and everything that they do to serve the patients that we all are trying to do the best we can to improve health and to improve lives. And we look forward to sharing more with you as we go through the year. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and our guidance for 2024. Labcorp delivered a strong finish to what was a transformational year for the company. Looking back, we executed well on our strategic priorities. We successfully integrated the lab operations of Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States. We completed the spin of Fortrea, our former clinical development and commercialization services business. We announced six new laboratory partnerships, reinforcing our position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories and we launched new innovative tests in our focus specialty areas across the business. As we begin 2024, we have momentum in both diagnostic laboratories and biopharma laboratory services. We expect to drive continued growth by expanding our base business, finalizing and integrating acquisitions and partnerships, by advancing our position in science, technology and innovation. We will continue to focus and lead in oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease, and neurology. Now, let's turn to the fourth quarter results. Labcorp performed well, driven by strong base business revenue growth in both diagnostics and bioparma. In the fourth quarter, revenue totalled $3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.30 and free cash flow from continuing operations excluding spin-related items was $422 million. Enterprise revenue increased 4% compared to fourth quarter of 2022, with diagnostics growing 3%, led by base business growth of 8% and bioparma growing 7% due to strong performance in central laboratories more than offsetting softness in early development research laboratories. Enterprise-based business margin was flat compared to the prior year despite being constrained by the mixed impact from recently closed hospital partnerships. Looking forward to 2024, we expect strong enterprise revenue growth of 4.7% to 6.5%. We expect margin improvement across both diagnostics and bioparma and we expect a adjusted EPS of $14.30 to $15.40, and applied growth rate at the midpoint of 10%. We also expect free cash flow to grow in excess of earnings. In a moment, Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 guidance. Turning to our enterprise strategy; in the fourth quarter, we continue to see positive momentum from our health systems and regional local lab partnership strategy. Labcorp continues to demonstrate that we are a partner of choice with several new health systems and regional local laboratory relationships. This is primarily due to our leadership in science and technology, our dedication to patients and our commitment to quality and efficiency. We announced a strategic partnership with Baystate Health in Western Massachusetts, to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets. We completed the acquisition of select assets from Legacy Health. Labcorp now manages Legacy's inpatient hospital laboratories, serving patients throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington State and we entered into an agreement to acquire Ambulatory [indiscernible] from Providence Medical Groups in California. Looking ahead, our M&A pipeline is robust and we remain focused on integrating and expanding our health system and regional local laboratory partnerships. These partnerships are typically accretive in the first year, with margins expanding over time during integration, and they return their cost of capital within just a few years. Turning now to our progress in science, technology and innovation; in the fourth quarter, Health [ph] by Labcorp, announced they will offer fertility and family building benefits. This benefit is the first of its kind that will allow employers and health plans to offer customizable solutions to employees and members to support their family building needs. Labcorp announced the availability of an ATM profile, the first blood-based test that combines three well-researched blood markers to identify and assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we announced the launch of the new FDA-cleared blood test for risk assessment and clinical management of severe preeclampsia. Labcorp and Hawthorne Effect announced a strategic collaboration to advance decentralized clinical trial capabilities for pharma, biotech and medical device sponsors. The collaboration is expected to increase patient diversity and inclusion to decrease site burden and to accelerate enrolment and clinical study timelines. Finally, for our Central Laboratory customers, we introduced a new sample testing application to provide enhanced near real-time visibility of specimens within the Central Lab. This phase is the first of many that will be launched for Labcorp customers. The application allows users to view events in the Central Lab's specimen sample journey for each assigned protocol and to customize how their data is structured. Turning now to the year ahead, we are focused on advancing our growth drivers that are outlined in our September 2023 Investor Day. We plan to continue to be a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. We will continue to develop, license and ultimately scale specialty testing, including Companion Diagnostics. We will work to bring our specialty testing to other parts of the world, which increases our global reach by leveraging our scale. For example, we're enabling our central laboratories in China and Geneva to perform liquid biopsy tests for clinical trials and we are well positioned for long-term success in cell and gene therapy and consumerism. We see tremendous opportunity for growth as we continue to focus on bringing new innovation, technology and products to market. In closing, 2023 was a strong and transformative year for Labcorp. We executed our strategy at exceptional scale and pace. I want to thank our more than 60,000 employees for their hard work and dedication to customers around the world. This enabled us to enter 2024 with considerable momentum that we intend to capitalize on to drive further value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives. With that, I'll throw the call over to Glenn. Yeah, hi, Jack. So, if you look at the pipeline for M&A that we have, it remains very strong. As you say, there's not deals the size of Ascension necessarily in health systems, but there's quite a few health systems that when you add them up, obviously become meaningful. In fact, if you look at our longer term guidance, historically we've said that we'd have 1% to 2% growth from inorganic means. We have now said we believe it's going to be 1.5% to 2.5%, reflecting that we believe that there is significant opportunity before us. We also mentioned partnerships with regional and local laboratories, and I think that there could be some additional partnerships in that areas, but as I think about capital allocation in general, I first thought that we're committed to our dividend. We then look to do as many of these hospital, local, regional laboratory deals as we can do because they're so sensible to do. They return across the capital very quickly. They're accretive in the first year, and we know how to do them really well. And then if there's something that is strategic to us, and one of our strategic priorities, we would look to do those, albeit we're not looking at anything of massive size, but after that, we then look at our share buybacks, which we continue to believe is a good way to use our funds as well. Yeah, so, Jack, let me first talk about margins just in general. So if you look at 2023, the margins were basically flat versus prior year. If you look at some of the things that we had to overcome, they were pretty significant, like COVID work that was significantly less this year than the prior year, but in addition to that, the hospital deals that we've done, in particular in the fourth quarter, had an impact on our margins, because although there are freedom in the first year, they're dilutive in the first couple of months as we do the integration until we have the ability to reduce costs to a level that makes sense over time. So we saw some impact from that in the fourth quarter as well. I feel really good about our margin accretion as we go into 2024 and we've said that we expect the margins to increase, but we also expect them to increase in each of the businesses, not just diagnostics, but also biopharma. Within biopharma, we expect them to be increased not just in Central Laboratories, but also in early development. So we continue to look for ways to reduce costs through a launchpad initiative. We're committed to reducing costs by $100 million to $125 million this year and each year for the next several years. In addition to that, our volume growth is helping us significantly. In particular, as we see growth in biopharma, that's going to help us with our margins. Despite the fact that we still have COVID overhang in 2024 versus '23, that we're continuing to improve the margins in our hospital deals, we're expecting to see the margins being accretive and growing this year, which to me is just a good sense of the underlying growth. With, particular focus on price, I would say price is net neutral when you look at overall price. There is some benefit to mix, and we continue to see mix helping us there. Yeah, I'll talk a little bit, and I'll ask Glenn to provide some additional context. Our Biopharma laboratory service business, remains a leader in both segments. We're a leader in Central Laboratory. We're also a leader in early development. Central Laboratory performed very well in the fourth quarter, and we expect is going to continue to perform well as we look at 5.5% to 7.5% growth in 2024 across the segment. But early development, we expect to continue to improve as we go through the year and we also expect early development to grow about the same amount as the overall guidance that we're giving for biopharma. A lot of the early development growth we expect will be in the second half of the year as we continue to see improvement and ramp up. Our RFPs look good in both segments. The largest segment, obviously, by far, is the Central Laboratories. The RFPs look good. Our win rate looks good. Big Pharma is continuing to send us a lot of RFPs that feel great. If you look at early development, the RFPs look good. The win rate looks good. What we've faced are some cancellations that are well above normal levels and we expect as we go through 2024 that, that will normalize and get us back to the RFPs and the win rate being positive for us, and therefore providing us with growth. Yeah. So Kevin, right now, the supply is not an issue. We have as much supply as we need. I feel very good about, as we go through this year and into the future, we have multiple suppliers now. We've certainly seen some of the pricing come down in the market, which is a good thing for us because NHP cost is largely a pass-through for us. We pass the benefit on to our clients. So you might see the revenue come down for us because the cost is coming down, but it shouldn't have any significant impact. In fact, it can help us a little bit when it comes to our margins. Sure Erin. So first of all, I would say, we came into 2024 with significant momentum. The diagnostics-based business grew 8% in the fourth quarter. Biopharma grew 7.1% in the fourth quarter. So I feel good about the guidance that we're providing for each of those businesses. So for diagnostics, it's 3.2% to 4.8%, midpoint of 4% growth. Biopharma, it's 5.5% to 7.5%, and midpoint of 6.5% growth. So very strong revenue growth. We are comfortable also saying that there'll be margin improvement in each of those businesses. That's despite the fact that there is going to be an impact in Diagnostics from weather and we expect it to be $0.10 to $0.15 in the first quarter and, therefore, the first quarter will be the hardest quarter for us of 2024, but the numbers I just gave you and the ranges that I gave you, midpoints, already, we already know what the weather was in January. So it already contemplates what happened in January. Yeah. So, Erin, we continue to support SALSA, and we continue to be optimistic that SALSA will get passed. We have support from both sides of the aisle, and ACLA, our trade organization, is working really hard to get that legislation passed. If it doesn't get passed, then we'll try to see if there's a way to get another year's delay. In our guidance, longer term guidance, we assume that there will be an impact from PAMA. So therefore, we continue to say, if it's not this year, it'll be next year. If it's not next year, it'll be the following year. Until the SALSA legislation is passed, then, I'm not going to take a lot of comfort that it could be another year delay or so forth. We're going to really work hard to have that passed. With regard to LBTs, we do not support the FDA's kind of what they're currently thinking about in terms of taking legislation that was created for the device industry and applying it to the diagnostic industry. We were very supportive of that, and that was legislation that would give FDA oversight of laboratory-developed tests. We think that's the right path to go. We'll continue to work with the trade organization to see if we can make progress there, but we think legislation that is fit for purpose for the diagnostic industry is the right path forward. Yeah, so what I would say, Stephanie is, number one, we have momentum in the diagnostics business and the momentum is coming from our base core business. We see it in both routine and esoteric testing. We have four therapeutic categories that we focus on that have higher growth in other specialty areas and we're going to continue to focus on those areas, oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease, and neurology and I believe that those are going to help us continue to grow because those parts of the market should grow disproportionately as we continue to go into the future. At the same time, there's no doubt that the acceleration of the hospital and local laboratory partnerships has enabled us to grow faster than what we've grown in the past and the good news is we have a strong pipeline of those as we go into the future. That's why we've raised the longer-term guidance for inorganic growth to 1.5% to 2.5%. Historically, we would have said 1% to 2%. So I think all those things combined give us momentum when it comes to the diagnostic volume. Yes. So if you look at what we've done with Ovia, we think it's a terrific way for us to have a digital capability in a very important core therapeutic area that we're focused on, women's health. And it really is what they've offered a first of its kind fertility family building benefit that we will be bringing to customers. The service offers care navigation and concierge services that helps individuals throughout their family building journey. And, we can offer it directly to patients if they like. We can offer it to employers. We have a very strong employer group, Laboratory Employer Services and this is just one of many offerings that we're going to be bringing to the marketplace, but because women's health is so important and because we are so focused on it, this is just another avenue for us to help in the women's health arena. Yeah, absolutely and I'll start broadly about our biopharma business and then I'll talk about the individual segments as well. So broadly, we had a good quarter of $1.26 billion, which we said in third quarter we expected the fourth quarter to be improved and obviously it was improved. If you look at our trailing 12 months, it's about $1.04 billion and we believe that that's -- you want to be around $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion is typically what we're targeting. I feel confident we'll be able to get there as we go through this year. We dropped off a really strong quarter in the fourth quarter of 2022. If I break apart the businesses and we start with a much larger business, which is the Central Laboratory business. Our RFPs are very strong. Our book-to-bill is very strong. Our win rate is very strong. We're not seeing as many cancellations as we're seeing in the other part of business because it's focused more on larger pharma. Although there are some cancellations there, there always are, it's not nearly as large as what we're seeing in early development. In early development, I feel comfortable as we go through 2024 because our RFPs coming into us are still very strong. Our win rate remains good. I feel good about where our win rate is. What's happened there is, there's been a lot of cancellations. I think there's two reasons for that. One is I think with NHP pricing the way it was, some very small biotech companies that got in line just decided to say we're just not going to do it now and then I also think that there are other pressures with smaller biotech companies that they're going through financially. As I look at this year, I feel good about both businesses and in early development, we're actually even seeing a larger amount of our business come from large and middle-sized pharma versus early pharma or early biotech and I think as we kind of make that transition to get more and more larger pharma in early development, we'll be able to even have a stronger book-to-bill moving forward, but net-net, I feel confident in both of the businesses, the ranges that we've provided and where we are today with the book-to-bills. I'll give some context on that, and I'll ask Glenn to add on. So if you look at the diagnostic business, I'd say the first thing is if you look at fourth quarter, you saw very strong revenue growth, about 8%. If you look at margin versus prior year, it was down slightly, about 30 basis points. What drove that primarily was that there were some minor things like increased health care costs and so forth, but it was driven primarily by the hospital deals that we did, that although they're accretive in the first year, in the first several months, they're typically diluted and we did several of those deals at the end of last year. As we come into this year, we're confident in the margin accretion for several reasons. One is obviously PAMA's been delayed. So that would have been a real headwind that we're not facing this year. We pushed that off into 2025. If you look at our volume increases, that's going to help us. The volume is going to be strong. If you look at the hospital deals, that we said extension would continue to give us some margin improvement over the next several years. Each of the hospital deals get a bit better as you go year-over-year. So we'll get some improvement from the hospital deals continuing to improve. We're also going to be looking to reduce costs across the enterprise, but a significant amount because of the size is in diagnostics of $100 million to $125 million and when you look at all those things together, we're expecting inflation to be about 3%, which is more than a typical rate than it's been in prior years. So if you put all that in, that's for our inflation of our people costs and so forth, should be around 3%, 3.5%. You put all those together and that's why we're confident that even though we have a headwind from COVID, that's fairly significant, about $130 million, we'll still be able to get some margin improvement in the diagnostic business. Sure. And it wasn't specific to fourth quarter, although there was an increase in the fourth quarter. We saw it throughout last year and we think there were several reasons. One, when there was an NHP supply issue, people were getting in line to run their NHP trials well in advance of what they typically would. By the time it was their turn, they would look and say, you know what, we're not going to do that trial. Either they reprioritized the pipeline, they decided the NHP costs were higher than what they had budgeted for, they decided just not to move forward at that time. The second thing is the funding in smaller biotech has been more difficult. So they're choosing their trials very carefully in the compounds that they move forward, but as we go forward, we're seeing, the RFPs look good as well as our win rates look good. So, the cancellations we believe are going to normalize. We're also starting to see a shift in our business a bit more towards mid-size to larger pharma as some of the smaller biotech have had those cancellations. They have less cancellations typically than the smaller ones. So that's why we think, we're going to see improvement as we go through this year. Yeah, sure. So as I came up with early development business, I've been saying for quite some time that we would like to see a shift towards more mid to larger size and I want to be clear, it's not significant. It's still more in the smaller biotech than it is to the mid to larger size. It's been something that we've been working on for multiple years now and we're seeing some progress, but also a part of it is that cancellations are occurring more often in the smaller biotech companies. So we were purposely moving that direction. There is a reason that we're able to move a little bit faster, but we still have work to do there. But over time, I would like to see that mix move more towards mid-size to larger format. Yes. So I'll take the second one first, which is, we feel confident in our contracts that we had put a few in place last year, but this year, there's no major expiration. So we feel good about where we are and there's not much risk in the guidance range as we go through this year and the next. But with regard to the ranges and certain things that go to the upper end of the funnel, obviously, the bottom of the revenue range, obviously, the diagnostic volume looks great and we're expecting that to continue. The weather is a bit of what's taking us a little bit back to the midpoint. So the weather is 10% to 15% impact, but the volume continues to be very, very strong. The rate in which we integrate the hospital deals will help us and we have very good track record of doing that. But the good news is there's not as much volatility this year as there's been in years in the past with COVID. So I feel good about the range. And in fact, the EPS range, we've narrowed it versus what that means would have been last year, the year before that, because there is less volatility and then I'd say in the biopharma services business, I would say that the strength we have and momentum is great. The thing that we're watching carefully are when the cancellations, in particular in early development, start to come back to more normal. Yes. So if you look at the esoteric testing volume, we continue to have a significant focus on the four therapeutic areas that we talked about. And we did, in fact, see in the fourth quarter and the full year that esoteric testing volume grew slightly faster than the routine, but it's strong to note that both of them grew strongly and we expect them to continue to both grow strongly, but we would expect esoteric to grow at a slightly higher rate in both volume and the volume obviously is at higher dollars. So maybe a little bit faster in the dollars. Yeah, no, I wouldn't use any one quarter for the margins. We expect the margins to actually improve across the business, across both diagnostics and biopharma. Diagnostics in the fourth quarter was impacted to some degree by the hospital integrations that we're doing, that there were several new ones. And although they're accretive in the first year, they were dilutive in the first couple of months. We expect that to improve as we go into next year. As we go to next year, there's still a COVID overhang in the diagnostic business, probably about $130 million or so, but even with that, we expect to get some slight margin improvement in that business and overcome that. Okay. So in closing, I know we're at the end of the hour. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. I want to thank our team here at Labcorp for their focus and dedication and everything that they do to serve the patients that we all are trying to do the best we can to improve health and to improve lives. And we look forward to sharing more with you as we go through the year. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. Going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2024 full-year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year, primarily due to organic-based business growth and the impact from acquisitions; partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 7.4% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 73%. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 5.2%. Operating loss for the quarter was $123 million due to an impairment charge of $334 million related to our early development research laboratory's business, as we've experienced soft biotech markets. In addition, we had $125 million of special charges related to acquisitions, COVID and the spin of Fortrea. Excluding these items in amortization, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $395 million or 13% of revenue, compared to $413 million or 14.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower COVID testing. Base business margins were in line with last year, as the benefit of demand and launch pad savings were offset by higher personnel and stranded costs and the mixed impact of recently completed hospital partnerships. Our launch pad and stranded cost reduction initiatives delivered around $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target of $100 million to $125 million per year. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.5% compared to 25.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings, and the benefit from increased R&D tax credits. We expect our adjusted tax rate for 2024 to be approximately 23%. Fully diluted EPS for the quarter was a loss of $1.95 due to the early development impairment charge. Adjusted EPS were $3.30 in the quarter, up 8% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $580 million in the quarter, compared to $607 million a year ago. The reduction in cash flow was due to lower COVID testing. Capital expenditures totalled $165 million in the quarter. For the full year, capital expenditures were 3.7% of revenue, and we expect this to be approximately 3.5% in 2024. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $414 million. The company invested $155 million in acquisitions and paid out $61 million in dividends. While we did not use any cash for share repurchases during the quarter, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program, which reduced our share count by approximately 1.1 million shares in the quarter. At the end of the year, we had $530 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. For the full year, free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related costs, was $888 million. The company invested $672 million on acquisitions, paid out $254 million in dividends, repurchased $1 billion of stock, and paid down $300 million of maturing debt. We continue to have a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities that will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. At year end, we had $537 million in cash with debt of $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.5 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now, review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year, with organic growth of 0.8% and acquisitions contributing 1.8%. The base business grew organically by 5.7% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 73%. Total volume increased 2.4% compared to last year, as organic volume grew 0.3%, which was constrained by lower COVID testing, while acquisition volume contributed 2.1%. Base business volume grew 5.2% compared to the base business last year, as organic volume increased 3.1%, while acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Price mix increased 0.2% versus last year, due to an organic base business increase that was mostly offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price mix was up 2.6% compared to the base business last year. Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $354 million, or 15.1% of revenue, compared to $387 million, or 16.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID testing. Base business operating income was up due to the benefit of higher organic demand, acquisitions, and launchpad savings, which were partially offset by higher personnel costs, including healthcare related costs. The decrease in margin was due to the reduction in COVID testing and the mixed impact from recently closed hospital partnerships, which we expect to improve over time. Now review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $695 million, an increase of 7.1% compared to last year, due to an increase in organic revenue of 4% and foreign currency translation of 3.1%. The 7.1% revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 12%, while early development was down 2% due to higher than normal cancellations. Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million, or 15.7% of revenue, compared to $95 million, or 14.7% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and Launchpad savings, partially offset by higher personnel and stranded costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.2 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Book-to-bill for the quarter was $1.26 billion, with the trailing 12 months at $1.04 billion. Now I'll discuss our 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 4.7% to 6.5% compared to 2023. This includes the favourable impact from foreign currency translation of 60 basis points. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 3.2% to 4.8% compared to 2023. The impact from lower COVID testing of around $130 million is expected to be offset by the annualization of acquisitions that were completed in 2023. We expect biopharma revenue to grow 5.5% to 7.5% compared to 2023. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency translation of 220 basis points. We expect central labs and early development to both grow within the segment guidance range. We expect margins in diagnostics and biopharma to be up in 2024 versus 2023, driven by top line growth and Launchpad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $15.40, with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of approximately 10%. While we do not guide the quarterly performance, it's worth noting that first quarter earnings will be below typical quarterly seasonality, due to weather disruption in January that we expect will impact earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 in the quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion, with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of approximately 21%. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions. Yeah, Jack, the only thing I'd also add to your comment earlier is that our guidance assumes that, again, we're going to generate between $1 billion to $1.15 billion of new free cash flow this coming year, and that we'll redeploy that for capital allocation of M&A buybacks and dividends, but the balance sheet is also strong. We ended the year at 2.5 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, and we have a targeted range of 2.5 times to three times. So to your point, if there were attractive opportunities out there on the M&A front, obviously share repurchases as well in addition to the free cash flow, we also have additional financial flexibility to pursue those opportunities. Yeah, Jack, the thing too, as Adam said, when you think about the Diagnostics business and the benefit, frankly, of seeing PAMA at least deferred out one year, that we expect the margins within diagnostics to be up in '24 all in, and that's even with the expectation that COVID testing is going to be down. Obviously, the underlying base business margin improvement would even be greater than that and as Adam said, the nice thing is with the growth that we expect, it's demand driven. A lot of it is the volume side. Price mix is still going to be favourable at a lesser extent than obviously the volume, but with unit prices being relatively flat, we have the opportunity, again to still see favourable mix to help, drive that improvement. Yeah, Kevin, just would add to that, when you look at the cadence, to your point, one, we expect Biopharma margins to be up year-over-year. Given the softness that we experienced, especially in the first half of 2023 with the supply constraints that we experienced in the early development in particular, you would expect to see the stronger part of the margin improvement in the first half of the year versus the second, but margins that would still be up year-over-year, even as we go through each quarter of the year and as Adam commented, that we expect margin improvement driven across both of our businesses. So we have early development and Central Lab both looking at revenue growth within that guidance range of 5.5% five and 7.5%. So on good top line growth, launch pad savings, we expect to see good margin improvement and to leverage that top line well. Yeah, Erin, a couple of comments too as well that demand utilization is positive and frankly, we're kind of at the higher end right now when you look at it year-over-year. When with the guide of, call it again, midpoint of around 4% for Diagnostics, kind of organically next year, our normal historical call it two-thirds volume, one-third price mix is probably a good indication which still speaks to the fact that volume levels are up nicely. When you compare them to pre-pandemic levels, we're within the normal range where historically we would say kind of 1% to 2% from volume, one on the price side. We're within that 1% to 2% growth rate now, cater organically compared to 2019, kind of on the lower end, but well north of kind of 1% growth. So, we're at kind of a normal level right now, a little bit higher expected than historical and the weather impact that we saw in January, to give you kind of the rounded numbers, probably impacted our revenue by around $25 million and we incrementally, the drop down on that would be at around 60% margin. So call it around 15%-ish of operating income or that $0.10 to $0.15 range that we gave in our prepared remarks from an earnings manager standpoint. Yeah, Patrick, just one other thing to think through as well. Again, we had a strong fourth quarter, which obviously is very encouraging, but it was still driven more on the Central Lab side. So while the orders and the RFPs and our win rates for even early development are doing well, it's those cancellations that have impacted it. So as you think about the cadence too for next year, when you look at the biopharma, you expect to be kind of a second half-weighted year on the revenue growth. So both businesses, again, within that 5.5% to 7.5% growth, but because of those cancellations, we do expect to see early development growth rate be much stronger in the second half than the first. We're on the Central Lab. Given the continued strength of its backlog, we expect that normal cadence of improvement each quarter as we go. Sure. Again, expect to see margins in both businesses that are up, but specifically in diagnostics. We do expect margins to be up in total diagnostics, albeit slightly up because of the impact, to your point, of COVID still being a headwind and the underlying base business margins doing well, but overall, we would say that we're going to be down around $130 million due to COVID. From a margin standpoint, call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points of kind of headwind that we're going to get. That, again, will be more than offset by the growth of the business and our Launchpad initiative. When you look at the interest expense, you can effectively take the run rate or where we ended the fourth quarter and kind of annualize that and then we do have around $1 billion of debt that's due late in 2024. So we're on $600 million in September, another $400 million in December. So we'll look to refinance it. The absolute debt levels that we have at that $5 billion, $5.1 billion, we expect to maintain. So we'll just refinance it, obviously, slightly higher rates than what will be maturing. So if you wanted to add 10% to the annualized number on top of that to reflect the refinancings at the end of the year, that would be a decent ballpark to be in. And again, the debt load from where we stand, we'll look for refinancing. We commented a little bit earlier that the leverage that we have as a company is still within our targeted range of kind of the 2.5 times to three times, but we're at the lower end. So obviously, we could potentially use additional leverage, additional debt, as we see potential other opportunities to deploy capital above the billion plus free cash flow that we'll generate this year, plus, we're sitting on a little bit of excess cash. Yeah, so no, Brian, we normally view, well, one obviously continues to be a tight labor market, but a market that's improved. From a nutrition standpoint, we continue to see improvement, but as a company, we're still higher than we were pre-pandemic and that varies across the segments because actually our biopharma is back to where we've been and we still see some additional pressure within the diagnostic side, but again, improving. Our general premise is that the labor market inflation for labor is around 3%, you can say 3% to 4%, but within that range. We've always commented that our Launchpad initiative was really in place to help offset that inflationary pressure. For us, a 3%, give or take, increase in our labor, call it merit in particular, would be a little bit over $100 million and again, we target that $100 million to $125 million a year. So again, we think things are levelling off, if you will, and that part of the margin improvement will be the Launchpad initiative to help offset those inflationary costs. So what we do guide to is that the free cash flow generation that we have will be used for share repo, M&A, and dividends. So it'll be across the board would be our expectation. We don't comment about how much is in each of the components, if you will, because it may vary based upon the acquisition opportunities that we see. But it'll be blended across and again, we commented as well that we have some additional balance sheet strength if we wanted to use that for additional M&A or buybacks, but the guidance that we gave and the earnings guidance, if you will, is reflected with all three of those capital allocation opportunities. Yeah, no, I kind of think that's right. Pito, that when you look this year as COVID becomes less of an impact, still an impact, it's kind of being offset by the acquisitions that we did late in the year. Really, it's the hospital partnerships and to your point, the margin is constrained a little bit when we do the in-hospital lab management agreements, but a typical M&A for us that would include hospital labs management tend to be more weighted to frankly the acquisition component. Ascension, as we've talked about, we called out one because of its sheer size, but also was disproportionately tied to the in-hospital lab. So less of an impact, a little bit of a headwind, but less of an impact. So it's really top line growth, cost controls, Launchpad business process improvement initiatives is really what's going to help drive the margins across both of our businesses. Yeah, Elizabeth, also on the cost side for BLS, it's not only the growth, but there are cost opportunities kind of in the post spin environment. We still have stranded costs that affect our Biopharma business that we're continuing to take out and obviously that's getting wrapped in our overall launchpad initiative as we talk to the $100 million to $125 million of savings each year. We did take out a meaningful amount of costs that were stranded. We had talked about having a $25 million dollar run rate of cost savings in the fourth quarter, which we achieved. So we'll get the benefit of that going forward, but there's still opportunities to consolidate. We still have a little bit of excess capacity within our early development side of the business. So we're managing that cost and the capacity, leaving ample room, though, because of the expectation that we're going to start to see good growth in that business as well. But it's not only obviously top line growth, but still opportunities to take some costs out. Yes. So we've kind of guided that we think a 23% adjusted tax rate is reasonable for the company and what's interesting, if you think about Labcorp today post spin, we actually have a higher percentage of our earnings now that are generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions than we did when we had the clinical business. In addition, we have a higher percentage of R&D. So a higher percentage of R&D benefit than we did when we had clinical. So overall, while we historically have trended and seen our tax rate decline year-to-year over the last few years, the profile of the company gives us confidence that the 23% rate now is a sustainable rate, plus or minus going forward. Yes. So, Eric, when you think about the focus of the company, one of the key areas of target is an oncology. And obviously with PGX, OmniSeq, other areas that we've acquired as well are more R&D driven than historically Labcorp was. So each year we continue to make more investments, more opportunities and with that increased investment come the tax deductibility of that. Obviously, there's still some pending tax laws that are out there right now, where you can advertise that benefit over a number of years. From a cash standpoint, we're kind of pre-funding it. So hopefully we'll get -- that will change and we'll get more. There's obviously the impact of potentially global minimum taxes that really don't affect us that much, given as we look at where, again, geographically we generate our earnings. Really not going to have any meaningful impact. So from a sustainability standpoint, we think that 23% plus or minus rate is a reasonable rate to go forward, but obviously, the more we grow, the more we grow internationally gives us an opportunity to structurally change that maybe a little bit more favorably as well. Yeah, it's across the board. We have investments that span the entire company. I think the increase that we've been seeing that has been driving the more favourable amount has been driven more on the diagnostic side, but frankly, our oncology spans the enterprise. So everything that we work on and where we work on it and who's working on it, again, we would say is across the enterprise, but more weighted to diagnostics. No, sure, Eric. So from the stranded costs, we commented that we had around $45 million of stranded costs and that our initial target was to take out that $25 million at a run rate this year, which, again, we've achieved. So there's more to come. So in the fourth quarter, call it around a $6 million headwind that we had due to stranded costs that obviously impact margins. As we go forward with the TSA support, so what we're doing to support Fortrea, IT and other areas, that's effectively a pass-through, right? We're providing the service. They're paying us for that service. Once they're fully sustainable on their own and the TSAs would go away, our costs go away because, frankly, most of the costs are contract labor-related on the IT side. So when the job's done, those costs are gone overall, but we continue to tackle the other stranded costs as well. So when you look at it, the goal was, to have all the TSAs completed within two years. I can tell you Fortrea and Labcorp are both very motivated to see and incentivized to see that transition happen as soon as possible. The good news is that both are focused on it. We're making good progress. Fortrea is making very good progress and we would expect to hopefully see those TSAs expire earlier than what we had planned or at least what we had planned for, but again, the costs will go with that. Yeah. And Lisa, I think on Adam's comment that when you look at the profile of Labcorp now that we've spun the clinical development business, it has taken out some of the volatility and variability, if you will. So the guidance ranges really across the businesses and the enterprise are actually a little bit tighter than what we normally do. Obviously, we're just starting out the year. The midpoint, obviously, our guidance is our best expectation that we have, realizing obviously higher demand would promote more on the upper end or softer demand down below, but needless to say as we go through the year, we'll continue to tighten the ranges with less time left in the year."

After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program. Christin O'Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead.\nChristin O'Donnell: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome the Labcorp\u2019s third quarter 2023 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com we posted both our press release and an investor relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include but are not limited to statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies expected savings and synergies, including from the launchpad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll cover our third quarter performance, and I'll discuss strategy which we reviewed at a recent investor day. In the third quarter Labcorp delivered strong year-over-year growth across the enterprise with acceleration or diagnostic laboratories and biopharma laboratory service businesses. Our growth is fueled by our ability to execute well and to deliver greater value for our customers, through our leadership in science, innovation and technology. We see strength in our businesses. We have enhanced financial flexibility, and a clear strategic focus, all of which enable us to end the year with significant momentum. Labcorp will continue to drive growth by expanding our base business, finalizing and integrating our hospital and health system and our local and regional laboratory transactions. And by advancing our leadership and high growth strategic areas, including specialty testing. Moving to our third quarter results in the third quarter revenue totaled $3.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.38. And free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin related items was $227 million. Enterprise revenue increased 7% compared to their prior year. Diagnostics laboratories based business revenue continued exceptional year-over-year growth with a 16% increase driven by organic growth and progress in our hospital and health system strategy, including retention. Biopharma Laboratory Services had a strong growth in the third quarter of 8%. Enterprise based business margin was down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to the mixed impact of retention. We continue to expect full year-base business margins to be flat to slightly up versus prior year, implying an increase in fourth quarter margins year-over-year. Then we'll provide more detail on our quarterly results, as well as a 2023 outlook in just a moment. Turning now to our Enterprise Strategy in the third quarter, we have significant momentum in our health system, and local and regional laboratory partnership strategy. I believe the momentum is due to our leadership in science and technology in our dedication to patients, and in our commitment to quality and efficiency. With the most recent partnership announcement, we strengthened our presence and scale in the Northeast and West Coast. In the Northeast, we advanced three partnerships during the quarter. In July, we finalized a strategic relationship with Jefferson Health, one of the largest and most prominent health systems serving the greater Philadelphia area and southern New Jersey. In August, we forged a strategic partnership with Tufts Medicine, a leading health system in Massachusetts, patients and providers of Tufts Medicine now have improved access to standardized laboratory testing throughout the Tufts Medicine system. We recently finalized our initial agreement with Tufts Medicine, and we reached agreement to expand the relationship to manage Tufts Medicine in-patient hospital laboratories later this year. And earlier this month, we announced the strategic relationship with Baystate Health, in which we would acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets, including laboratory service centers, operated throughout Western Massachusetts. On the Northwest, we announced a comprehensive lab relationship with Legacy Health in Portland, we will acquire select assets of its outreach laboratory business, and manage its inpatient hospital laboratories. We also finalized our acquisition of Providence, Oregon's outreach laboratory business in September. The depth and the breadth of opportunity and the quality of our pipeline is robust, and we are optimistic about continued expansion. The partnerships meet our financial criteria, including being your creative in the first year, and return your cost of capital within three years. While the first-year margins are typically lower than Labcorp\u2019s historical margin levels, there was a clear path to improvement. Turning now to our advancements in innovation in technology. In late September Labcorp became the first company to broadly offer an ATN profile, a blood-based test that combines three well researched blood biomarkers to identify and to assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, Amyloid-Tau Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration targeted for patients who are being evaluated from mild dementia. This new test builds the Labcorp\u2019s leadership in new neurodegenerative testing options, and gives physicians and easily accessible and interpretable blood test to assess pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Turning to women's health, we announced the new consumer offering for menopause in the quarter. Lapcorp\u2019s on demand menopause test, aims to help women understand symptoms and hormonal factors related to menopause so they can have more informed conversations with their providers. Finally, our Biopharma Laboratory services team opened two new international facilities in China, a new kit production facility, and an immunology and immune toxicology laboratory. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, as we discussed at Investors Day, we are excited about the future of Labcorp and our strong financial outlook on a CAGR basis to 2026. We expect overall enterprise revenue growth of 5% to 8%, including 1.5% to 2.5%, from acquisitions. For Diagnostic Laboratories, we expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect Biopharma Laboratory services to grow organically between 4.5% to 7.5%. We're focusing on two significant drivers of near-term growth and differentiation as we move towards those target ranges. The first is to be the partner of choice for health systems, and local or regional laboratories. And the second is to develop to license and ultimately to scale specialty testing, including companion diagnostics. I mentioned the momentum that we have in our health system strategy earlier. We've announced five new agreements this year. Additionally, specialty testing, we are focused on four primary areas, oncology, woman cell, autoimmune disease, and neurology, which we anticipate will outpace the growth of other therapeutic areas. The development of Specialty Tests and Companion Diagnostics makes us attractive partners to health systems and biopharma as they continue to develop more therapies and highest specialty areas. Our scale and our geographic presence will be differentiators for both growth initiatives. We're also well positioned for long term success in Cell & Gene Therapy, expanding into consumer market and international growth through our innovative specialty testing and biopharma business. All this will culminate the top line performance that we expect will exceed $14 billion by the end of 2026. To close, our team of over 60,000 global employees is executing Labcorp\u2019s global strategy at scale, and then an exceptional pace repose. As we post 2023, we will continue to capitalize on the momentum that we've created, and drive further value creation for our shareholders. This year has been transformational for Labcorp. We're focused on our growth strategy. And we plan to finish strong as you pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by discussion of our performance in each segment, and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year. Primarily due to organic based business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 14% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 87%. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 10.8% benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the Outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth, Ascension annualized on September 30th. Operating income for the quarter was $252 million, or 8.3% of revenue. During the quarter we had $56 million of amortization and $116 million of restructuring charges and special items due to the spin of Fortrea, COVID acquisitions and Launchpad initiatives. Excluding these items adjusted operating income in the quarter was $424 million, or 13.9% of revenue, compared to $491 million, or 17.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mixed impact from the Ascension lab management agreement. Excluding these items margins would have been flat as the benefit of demand and Launchpad savings were offset by higher personnel expense. Our Launchpad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the three-year period ending 2024. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 19.4% last year. The increase in the adjusted rate was primarily due to higher R&D tax credits realized last year. We continue to expect the fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter from continuing operations were $184 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, adjusted EPS were $3.38 in the quarter, down 16% from last year to the lower COVID testing earnings, as base business adjusted EPS was up approximately 10%. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $276 million in the quarter, which was burdened by approximately $56 million of spin related items. Operating cash flow of $276 million is up from $253 million a year ago due to higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $105 million, up from $83 million last year. For the full year we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $171 million, which was burdened by approximately $56 million of spin related items. The company invested $380 million in acquisitions, paid out $64 million in dividends and used $1 billion for an accelerated share repurchase program that we expect will be completed by year end. At quarter end, we had around $725 million in cash, while debt was $5.4 billion. Our leverage was 2.7 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now review our segment performance beginning with diagnostics laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 3.4% and acquisitions of 3%. The base business grew organically by 12.8% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 87%. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 6% of the growth. Total volume increased 2.3% compared to last year, as acquisition volume grew 3.4% primarily offset by organic volume of minus 1.1% due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 7.2% compared to the base business last year, as organic increased 3.6% for volume, while acquisitions also contributed 3.6%. Price mix increased 3.9% versus last year primarily due to an organic base business increase partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price mix was up 9.2% compared to bass business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 6%. Diagnostics laboratories adjusted operating income for the quarter was $386 million, or 16.5% of revenue compared to $440 million or 19.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to reduction in COVID-19 testing. While the margin was also affected by the mix impact from Ascension. Base business margin excluding the mix, impact of Ascension was up approximately 30 basis points as the benefit of organic growth and Launchpad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense. Now review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $719 million an increase of 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in organic revenue of 4.9% and foreign currency of 3.3%. The 7.9% revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs which was up 9%, while early development was up 5.7%.  While early development is no longer constrained by NHP availability, it has experienced higher than normal cancellations and lower orders, primarily due to small biotech funding. Biopharma Laboratory Services adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $105 million or 15.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to stranded costs as a result of a spin of Fortrea which is timing related.  Excluding stranded cost margins were up in the third quarter. As the benefit of top line growth and Launchpad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. We expect margins in the fourth quarter to be up sequentially and year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.8 billion, and we expect approximately $2.4 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.12. Now discuss our 2023 full year guidance which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2023 for the remainder of the year. The Enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions share repurchases and dividends. In addition, the guidance includes the impact from the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was funded with proceeds from the spin.  With regard to our 2023 full year guidance, we've narrowed the ranges but have maintained the same midpoint from our prior guidance for Enterprise revenue, earnings and cash flow. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.9% to 2.7% compared to 2022. This increase reflects the base business growing 11.5% to 12.2%. While COVID testing is expected to decline 85% to 86%. We expect Diagnostics Laboratories revenue to be up 1.5% to 2% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 14.1% to 14.6%, which includes approximately 5% growth from Ascension. The base business has improved from our prior guidance as acquisition related revenue that was forecasted at the enterprise level is now reflected in the segment as we've closed those transactions. We continue to expect Diagnostics Laboratories base business margin to be up slightly in 2023 versus 2022 including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect Biopharma Laboratory Services revenue to grow 3.1% to 4% compared to 2022. Excluding the change in currency translation at negative 20 basis points, the midpoint of the guidance range remains unchanged from our prior guidance, we expect the revenue growth rate to continue to improve in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect margins for the full year to be flat to slightly up, while the fourth quarter is expected to see both sequential and year-over-year improvement. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $13.25 to $13.75, unchanged at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin related items is expected to be between $850 to $950 million. Also unchanged from our prior guidance at the midpoint. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, we expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth will also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and dividends. Operator we\u2019ll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your question please.\nKevin Caliendo: Sure. Guess I want to go into the book-to-bill in the sequential -- the commentary about Biopharma and cancellations. When did you start to see that? How meaningful is it? Is it across multiple customers? Any more color around what's happening with the orders in the Biopharma business cancellations, as much color as you can provide would be super helpful?\nAdam Schechter: Sure, good morning, Kevin. So, if you look at the third quarter book-to-bill it was a bit light versus the prior quarter. And it was mostly due to small and emerging biotech. And it was mostly due to those customers in our early development, research laboratories. Large pharma, middle sized biotech, which is the majority of our customers in our central laboratories, which is the largest part of our biopharma segment, remain strong. And as I look at fourth quarter, I expect the book-to-bill in fourth quarter to be better than it was in the third quarter. If you look at the trailing 12 months, it was 1.12. And to me, that still remains pretty healthy. If you remember, last quarter, I mentioned that with a clinical development business now being a separate company. You would expect the book-to-bill to be lower. In particular, because in early development, most of those trials are very short-term, they can be one month, three months, they usually start and end in the same year that you have them. So, that's why I feel confident that we'll continue to see progress. I feel that the largest part of our business Central Laboratories remains very strong in RFPs, book-to-bill, and we just have to continue to try to find a way to change our mix a bit in early development. I'd like to move early development to work more with the midsize biotech, maybe some of the pharma companies versus having too much reliance on smaller emerging biotech companies. If you look at the revenue, I felt very good about the revenue in the bio pharma business with 8% revenue growth in the segment for the quarter. And we accept expect to see continued strength in revenue growth.\nKevin Caliendo: And just the confidence that it gets better next quarter, is that visibility? Is that just basically writing off some of the stuff that the cancellations are going to improve? Like what gives you that sense? Obviously, you can see more than we can, I'm just wondering what that is, that we can sort of rely on?\nAdam Schechter: So, again, I'm just looking at the number of RFPs coming through our run rate, and so forth. And based upon what I see, as I sit here today. I expect us to have a better quarter and fourth quarter for book-to-bill in the third quarter. And sometimes book-to-bill is timing related you think you might get a trial the third quarter ends up falling to the fourth. I've always said to be careful to look at any one quarter when it comes to book-to-bill. And that's why we also provide the trailing 12 months. Yeah,\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks so much. Super helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan, your question please.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. The other side of the business. Good morning when I think about the diagnostic side of business and the strong core growth. Just two questions there one, can you talk about where you are on managed care contracting and, you know, in helping them and the shift inside of care go into lower cost? Lab services like Labcorp versus, you know, and have inpatient etcetera. And then secondly, as we think about routine testing, are you seeing an increase in metabolic testing specifically, like A1c, as you think about the GLP, one praise?\nAdam Schechter: Sure, this first one, you know, we're very pleased with the performance in the diagnostic sector, not just when you look at overall revenue, which includes Ascension. But when you look at the base business volume, if you look at that the base business volume was up 7.2%. And about 3.6% was from acquisition. So, it just tells you that the organic base business remains very strong. Our managed care contracting, we're in very good position. We've there finalized or are close to finalizing all of the contracts that were large and need to be renewed. And I would say, you know, there'll be a basically flat to slightly positive, which is a good place for us to be as we move into next year. So, I feel very good about that. You know, we look at metabolic testing. And then we look at all the different types of routine testing. And we haven't, yet we see that growing, but it's growing at consistent rates as it's grown before. And we still see our esoteric testing growing a little bit faster, but almost about the same as our routine testing. And if you look at like our metabolic testing, and so forth, we don't really see an acceleration there. And a lot of the metabolic testing is done in panels. And it's done with other tests, and so forth. So, I wouldn't expect to see a significant change necessarily, with the GLP ones moving forward. But the growth is very broad based. It's across geographies is across routine and esoteric testing. It's across all the different types of testing that we have. So, the underlying dynamics are very strong.\nLisa Gill: It\u2019s very helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your question, please.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Good morning, just a follow up on the early development side, you know, interesting to hear kind of maybe shifting towards a little bit new, newer of a customer base more towards the midsized. Does that, I guess, what does that entail? You just have to cater the offering a little bit more towards that customer base? And is there a little bit of disruption as that happens? Maybe just talk through how you think about moving the portfolio more towards that client base?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, absolutely. One of the things Patrick we're trying to do is to focus more on the specialty testing, and also thinking about how to expand internationally on things like companion diagnostics. When you think about a mid to large pharma company, as they develop more personalized medicine, they're going to want to have some type of diagnostic tool or companion diagnostic that they can use to develop to identify which patients are most apt to respond to the medicine, but also have it available ultimately, in the marketplace. So, where we're trying to go is to show pharma that they work with us early. We can help them develop their diagnostic tests. We have very strong capabilities and companion diagnostics, and developing specialty diagnostic tests. We can help them do their clinical trials to our Central Laboratories, and do all the companion diagnostic testing, and specialty testing. And ultimately, we want to be able to offer to them, that we can launch that test not only in the United States, but we can help them bring those specialty and companion diagnostic tests to other parts of the world. I think it'd be a very compelling discussion to have with pharma. And we're having some of those discussions as we speak.\nPatrick Donnelly: Understood, thanks. And then maybe just on the margin piece, you know, obviously, you guys gave a pretty detailed guidance at the Analyst Day, maybe just near term, if you could talk through the moving pieces that sounds like you know, pricing relatively stable, but just the moving parts as we work our way into the end of the year, and then \u201824. And then just think high level about the margin piece. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you. Yeah, I'll ask them to jump in as well. I'd say the largest impact of margins, as I think about 2024 is PAMA. And we've built in about $80 million, almost $80 million of downside into our base case, assuming that PAMA comes next year. We're still trying to see, working with our trade group if there's a way to get the SALSA legislation approved. We have bipartisan support, but we had that last year. So, it's very hard to get things approved right now. We're also going to see if there's a way to delay for another year the implementation, but for our base case, we're assuming that there's about an $80 million impact that would negatively impact the margins next year. That's why we gave the long-term guidance. And we said it's 100 to 150 basis point increase over the time period. We said most of that will be after 2024. Because in 2024, we have to overcome PAMA. Let's wait and see if PAMA doesn't come or if it's delayed, then we'll have some upside there for sure.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, Patrick, just I guess, as you look to the two businesses, we feel good about where we are with the margins, they continue to improve on a base business level. As we think about going into the fourth quarter. We commented that within the biopharma side, we expect margins to be up in the fourth quarter and year-on-year, such that for the full year, there'll be flat to slightly up. In diagnostics, obviously, we have seasonality that impacts margins of fourth quarter sequentially, margins will be down, but they'll still be up year-over-year. So, that we expect diagnostics margins for the full year, to be up slightly, even after absorbing the negative impact from the Ascension mix. As Adam commented in the 100, to call it 150 basis point margin improvement that we expect over the next three years. We commented that the first-year margins would be relatively flat, we have around a 70-basis point headwind, if you will, between the combination of lower COVID testing, as well as the PAMA headwind that that Adam commented, but that's reflected still in the three-year expectation that margins would grow that 100 basis points to 150 basis points.\nPatrick Donnelly: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your question please.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Good morning, want to stick with the macro environment on the diagnostic lab side, Adam, are you seeing any recessionary signals at all in terms of the testing getting ordered? And then maybe on the flip side, hearing any change in the tenor of your hospital conversations around consolidation opportunities?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, Jack. So, you know, when you look at the macro dynamics, I would say for testing, it remains strong. And when you look at the volume that we're seeing, it remains very strong as well. And it's broad based across the country and esoteric and routine testing. If you go back to historical recessionary periods, the diagnostic business tends to continue to do well through those periods. So, I feel pretty confident that we're going to continue to be see strength there. When it comes to hospitals. You know, I've talked about how the hospital health system but also local and regional laboratory acquisition possibilities remain extraordinarily strong. And I think it's because they're struggling in the economic environment, with reimbursement with wages, and other things. And they're looking for ways that they can get some capital, but also look for people that are like experts in hiring, the types of jobs that we hire for managing the type of people that we manage. So, I think the macro environment for the health systems and for these local smaller regional laboratories is very strong for us to continue to find ways to do business development and find visual partnerships. So, it's actually a good environment for us to compete. But obviously, we want our hospital systems to remain solvent and, you know, they have a lot of things that they have to do to continue to be successful.\nJack Meehan: Great. And, Glenn, at the Analyst Day for 2024. You laid out some initial thinking it would be slightly below the 8.5% to 11%. EPS CAGR range. Just curious if anything, you know, in terms of the orders on the biopharma lab side or just anything else changes the way you're thinking about that? Thanks.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, no, Jack. Again, when we basically reaffirmed kind of our outlook for this year as well as our three years when we were at the Analyst Day, we knew there was some softness we had experienced within early development earlier. So, that continues, but as Adam said, kind of offset by the strength that we're seeing with on the Central lab side. So, for Biopharma, and for Diagnostic segments, we feel very good. So, if you look at call it that 8.5% to 11.5% EPS target over the next three years, the CAGR, we still feel very good about that, realizing that for 2024, because again of the headwinds from less COVID testing and PAMA, you'd have around 800 basis point headwind to EPS in 2024. So, still positive EPS growth year-on-year even with those headwinds, but lower than, if you will, the range that we had, but again, that three-year range includes that expectation for 2024.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird, your question, please.\nEric Coldwell: Good morning. Thank you I have two, the first one may be a bit confusing. So, bear with me, your largest competitor and early developments given some interesting color around their cancellations, and talked about how a majority of those cancellations they've experienced were predicated on awards that were made a year ago, two years ago stuff that was, you know, clients pre booking stuff when they were concerned about capacity and access in the future. You're talking more about small clients. And it sounds like maybe this is more recent stuff. But I'm curious if you could talk at all about the aging of the cancellations, how long ago were these awards made? And is this something more in the moment? Or perhaps just clean up from past client activity that was abnormal? And then --\nAdam Schechter: Thanks for that clarification, we're seeing a similar thing that primarily with NHP trials that were, when there was supply issues, people started to get in line much earlier than they typically would to ensure that they could run their trials as fast as they could. Now that we have supply and so forth, as those clients studies are ready to go, they're not necessarily ready to go. Or they're thinking about their pipeline and other priorities, and so forth, because they booked these spots so far ago. So, that's the primary reason that we believe we're seeing these cancellations in early development.\nEric Coldwell: And then can you talk at all about gross awards in early development was that book-to-bill above one or below one this quarter?\nAdam Schechter: So, if you look, overall, if you just look at the quarter would have been below one. But as again, with early development, I don't think book-to-bill is really a good way to look at that business. Because when it comes to early development, they're one month trial, three months trials, maybe six-month trial, so you can burn through those in the same year. Very quickly, I look at the book-to-bill, you know, because I think it's a historical way to look at the business. But EPS is very small compared to Central Laboratory and the vast majority of our Accentual laboratory work remains very strong. So, that's why I feel confident, as I look at the numbers of the future, because of the size of our Central Laboratory, the mix of customers and Central Laboratories more towards pharma, and big biotech and the book-to-bill it remains pretty good.\nEric Coldwell: Okay, thank you for that, Adam. And I was just hoping you could talk a bit about the FDAs LDT proposal here and maybe help us with some quantification of what your LDT mix looks like by revenue or volume or any color, commentary on what you see progressing with the proposed rule at the FDA. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yep, absolutely. So, you know, we were supportive of legislation called valid last year that would have given FDA oversight for laboratory developed tests. And it was unfortunate that it didn't get passed last year, had bipartisan support, we were supportive. It's disappointing that legislation didn't go through. So, we're supportive of working with the FDA to find ways for them to give appropriate oversight. We think that our science or innovation or technology capabilities actually differentiate us. And if you look at the rigor that we go through with our laboratory developed tests, we think we do the vast majority of what they would be asking for anyway. Working with ACLA, our trade organization, what we're worried about is if you take legislation that had an intended purpose, for one thing, and then you try to apply it to another thing, you have to be very thoughtful about that. The good news is the FDA has asked for comments, and we're going to provide comments and thoughts. At the end of the day, if it's fairly done, meaning that all laboratory developed tests have to do the same thing across big labs, small labs and everything else, as long as they can get these filings done quickly so that people have access to new innovations in a timely manner, like they do today. We believe that it will be minimal impact to us in terms of the amount of money or spend because we do a lot of that work anyway. With that said, it's less than 10% of our volume. So, laboratory developed tests are not a significant portion of our volume. But sometimes they are the most important test for new specialty areas. And trying to get those to patients quickly is what's most important for them.\nEric Coldwell: Adam with less than 10% of volume, I would assume the revenue contribution would be higher because they are as you just stated, a bit unique at the testing so could you talk --\nAdam Schechter: It's less than 10% of the dollars to when I say less than 100% of the value is. It's less than 5%, frankly. And then the dollar is less than 10%.\nEric Coldwell: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tim Daley from Wells Fargo, your question please.\nTim Daley: So, first one on diagnostics, I think organic bass, this price mix, excluding Ascension was roughly 320 bits, if I just kind of back out the numbers. You know, if you break that out from like, like-for-like price versus mix impact for us in the quarter? And how is, standalone price been trending versus last quarter last year? I mean, healthcare would be great.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure. Hey Tim, this is Glenn. That's right, we would agree that your 320 is in line with the, call it the organic price mix favorability excluding the impact that we would get from Ascension. You know, from a pricing standpoint, we continue to say pricing is kind of flat, maybe a little bit of a headwind. You heard Adam earlier in the future with the renewals of the managed care contracts, you know, that actually is a positive for us. But most of the time that favorability in our price mix continues to be on the mix side, we continue to see favorability in our tests per session, you know, whether the payer mix test mix with a lot of things esoteric relative to routine. So, we continue to experience good favorable price mix, but more on the mix side.\nTim Daley: Appreciate that. And then my second question is on the direct consumer, so good to see a continued menu and expansion. This quarter with the announcement, just can you update us on the revenue mix within consumer? Where was it this quarter? What are you expecting, as a piece of that \u201823 guidance? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, no problem, Tim. So, direct to consumer advertising remains important. Wait for us to enable consumers to monitor and take care of the health. If you look at the dollar volume, especially if you take out the testing for COVID is still very small, and it's not worth it's not material enough to actually break out the numbers. We see it growing very substantially. But it's not necessarily at a point where we would break it out and give specific numbers for it. I think when it comes to consumer testing, we're going to see a lot more rope as we go through the years. At some point, if it reaches that material threshold, Tim will certainly start to break it out.\nTim Daley: Yeah, I appreciate time. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley, your question, please.\nErin Wright: Thanks. Hi, good morning. I know you mentioned the base margin improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter. But are you seeing the need in one of your competitors, as mentioned in that mentioning this, but stepped-up investments in labor? And just the current utilization environment? Maybe that some of the seasonality you were talking about in the fourth quarter, but how are you just thinking about the labor environment right now? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah thanks, Erin. So, labor environment is tough across industries, across countries. I mean, there's no doubt that the good news is, you know, I look at our retention rates. And if you look at retention from 2019, we saw a significant loss of people and our actual turnover rate was up substantially in 2021 and 2022. If we now look at 2023, we've seen those rates come down in our biopharma business, they've come down almost to the 2019 levels. If you look at our diagnostic business, they're not yet at our 2019 levels, but they're getting closer. And you know, we expect there to be continued progress there. But we have had to pay a bit more in certain areas, we've had to be competitive in the marketplace. It does impact the margins. But at the same time, that's why we've been so aggressive with Launchpad. And we're on track to deliver the $350 million of Launchpad savings that we discussed in the past. We also at Investor Day talked about a $100 million to $125 million year reduction through Launchpad.  And we also mentioned that we have an increase in our margins over the \u201823 to \u201826 period of 100 to 150 basis points, mostly coming after the PAMA year in 2024. So, most of that in \u201825 and \u201826. So, at the end of the day, we realized we've got to find ways to reduce costs. So that we can offset some of the pressure that we're facing when it comes to, you know, the wages and so forth.\nErin Wright: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then on the early development business, just to enlighten the environment in some of the volatility you've been there. And what you've been talking about in terms of the Biopharma landscape, but you know, has anything changed in terms of your commitment to the business at this point? Is that an area that you'll continue to evaluate? Thanks?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, thanks Erin. You know, again, it is a very small part of our business. I mean, if you look at the business as a percent of Labcorp, it's very small, it's less than 10%, frankly. And if you look at it as a percent of the biopharma business, it's maybe 30% or so. So, at the end of the day, it's really Central Laboratory that drives our success and Biopharma. At the same time with the strategic things that we're trying to do with companion diagnostics. And work with pharma earlier, bringing those companion diagnostics to Central Laboratories, and then ultimately bring them to the marketplace. Strategically, I still think it makes sense. And I still think that we could do a lot of other things with our early development that helps us in the broader, bigger business that we have. And we continue to evaluate all things.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nKieran Ryan: You've got Kieran Ryan on for Pito. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one here. I just wanted to see how you guys are tracking on taking out some of the stranded costs after the span, I believe you were talking about targeting 25 million of the 45 million at the industry rate. So just wanted to see if there's any update there?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. All right. So, we're on target, we said we have this 25 million by the end of this year. So the runway next year, that would be taken out. But I think the most important piece is that that's not enough. And if we're going to do that, plus, we have to do more. So, as I said, we're on track for a $350 million Launchpad initiative. And we've committed to 100 million to 125 million per year, in the outer years, as we look at a long term forecast that includes $25 million of stranded costs, but it just tells you we've got to do a lot more.\nKieran Ryan: Got it. Thank you. And then just real quick on the Biopharma side, just wanted to check is there as we head into \u201824, is there any seasonality that we should be aware of there? And does that change at all after the spin versus pre spin or not? Not too much call out? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, I like to that answer question. In general, I don't see that there'll be a significant shift, in terms of we've always had some seasonality. And if you look at like Central labs, for example, they always start off a little bit slower in the first quarter, because a lot of pharma are starting to get their studies running in third quarter, sometimes a little slower as Europe comes back after vacation. But net-net, you know, there shouldn't be any significant changes to what we've seen in the past.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yeah, that's right. And the numbers that we've provided historically have been restated for the company we are today. So, you can look at our enhanced disclosures that we have that you'll see some historical numbers. But the other interesting thing is, the seasonality of the two segments are a little bit counter to each other. So, it actually when you look at it from an enterprise level, mutes the seasonality for each of the businesses.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America, your question, please.\nUnidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is John on for Derek. Wanted to revisit the PAMA issue there. I recognize that your guidance is assuming the PAMA impact as a base case, and you've talked about the 70 basis points of headwind between PAMA and COVID. But in the case of a delay, would you allocate that 80 million benefit that will turn into a benefit now between maybe letting it trickle down to margins versus investments?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, we're going to push for the vast majority of it to come down to margin. I mean, there might be some incremental minor investments, but we've got almost $80 million into the plan, and I would expect the vast majority of that to come down.\nUnidentified Analyst : Appreciate it. And then with the ATN profile, could you comment on? What sort of reimbursement you've been able to negotiate with the payers versus what you're getting from the CMS? And I know, early earlier, you talked about the LBT tests as a volume, it's less than 5% and a sale that's less than 10%. But still curious if you plan on taking it for the FDA approval, or if there's going to be any sort of disruption there. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yeah. So, at this point, we don't think there'll be any disruption to the ATN profile, we've launched it into the marketplace. You know, some managed care organizations are starting to reimburse others we're in discussions with, but a lot of the reimbursement in that area is from providers and the health systems and so forth. So, we expect we'll have good reimbursement from those areas as we go forward. It's still relatively new tasks, we\u2019re still have physicians, learning about the panel and so forth. So, it will take time, but over time, we expect it to be reimbursed well.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you. That's all.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nBrian Tanquilut: Good morning. I guess I'll start, Adam, as I think about a comment that your competitor made yesterday, like contract renewals. Just curious what you're seeing on your side in terms of contracting with payers, and your kind of like rate trends there as we think about upcoming rehabs and contracts?\nAdam Schechter: Yeah, absolutely. Brian. So, you know, we've renegotiated the majority of our contracts were really, really finished. And, really close on one last one. But they ended up being very good negotiations, very good discussions, we think that ultimately, it will be flat, maybe slightly positive. So, I feel really good about that.\nBrian Tanquilut: Got it. And then Glenn, you've talked about a three-year kind of like margin goals of 100 basis point to 150 basis point improvement, as we think about the moving parts between labor Launchpad. And I think we're getting questions from people asking, you know, when do we see the flow through of all that, and improving it in volumes to the margin line? How should we be thinking about that?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Well, again, a lot of the, the expectation is that we're looking at good top line growth. So, we would expect to leverage off of that Launchpad savings that we've identified as well, and then being offset by labor and potentially continued inflationary environment. You know, for us, we talk a lot about labor, because it represents around 50% of our cost structure. So, we're very focused on it. And as Adam said, we are seeing some improvement in the attrition levels, but it's still higher than where it's been in the past. And there's a cost to that, let alone just the labor wage rates inflation, if you will, but all that's been factored in. So, to the extent we can continue to drive the top line that we feel confident about, and realize the Launchpad savings, which we feel confident about, we equally expect to see that margin improvement.\nBrian Tanquilut: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program, I'd like to hand the program back to Adam Schechter for any further remarks.\nAdam Schechter : Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. Hope you can tell that we remain very optimistic about the prospects for Labcorp as we continue to execute, and we execute well on our strategy, and that we believe our strategy is going to continue to drive substantial shareholder value. Hope everybody has a good rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll cover our third quarter performance, and I'll discuss strategy which we reviewed at a recent investor day. In the third quarter Labcorp delivered strong year-over-year growth across the enterprise with acceleration or diagnostic laboratories and biopharma laboratory service businesses. Our growth is fueled by our ability to execute well and to deliver greater value for our customers, through our leadership in science, innovation and technology. We see strength in our businesses. We have enhanced financial flexibility, and a clear strategic focus, all of which enable us to end the year with significant momentum. Labcorp will continue to drive growth by expanding our base business, finalizing and integrating our hospital and health system and our local and regional laboratory transactions. And by advancing our leadership and high growth strategic areas, including specialty testing. Moving to our third quarter results in the third quarter revenue totaled $3.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.38. And free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin related items was $227 million. Enterprise revenue increased 7% compared to their prior year. Diagnostics laboratories based business revenue continued exceptional year-over-year growth with a 16% increase driven by organic growth and progress in our hospital and health system strategy, including retention. Biopharma Laboratory Services had a strong growth in the third quarter of 8%. Enterprise based business margin was down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to the mixed impact of retention. We continue to expect full year-base business margins to be flat to slightly up versus prior year, implying an increase in fourth quarter margins year-over-year. Then we'll provide more detail on our quarterly results, as well as a 2023 outlook in just a moment. Turning now to our Enterprise Strategy in the third quarter, we have significant momentum in our health system, and local and regional laboratory partnership strategy. I believe the momentum is due to our leadership in science and technology in our dedication to patients, and in our commitment to quality and efficiency. With the most recent partnership announcement, we strengthened our presence and scale in the Northeast and West Coast. In the Northeast, we advanced three partnerships during the quarter. In July, we finalized a strategic relationship with Jefferson Health, one of the largest and most prominent health systems serving the greater Philadelphia area and southern New Jersey. In August, we forged a strategic partnership with Tufts Medicine, a leading health system in Massachusetts, patients and providers of Tufts Medicine now have improved access to standardized laboratory testing throughout the Tufts Medicine system. We recently finalized our initial agreement with Tufts Medicine, and we reached agreement to expand the relationship to manage Tufts Medicine in-patient hospital laboratories later this year. And earlier this month, we announced the strategic relationship with Baystate Health, in which we would acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets, including laboratory service centers, operated throughout Western Massachusetts. On the Northwest, we announced a comprehensive lab relationship with Legacy Health in Portland, we will acquire select assets of its outreach laboratory business, and manage its inpatient hospital laboratories. We also finalized our acquisition of Providence, Oregon's outreach laboratory business in September. The depth and the breadth of opportunity and the quality of our pipeline is robust, and we are optimistic about continued expansion. The partnerships meet our financial criteria, including being your creative in the first year, and return your cost of capital within three years. While the first-year margins are typically lower than Labcorp's historical margin levels, there was a clear path to improvement. Turning now to our advancements in innovation in technology. In late September Labcorp became the first company to broadly offer an ATN profile, a blood-based test that combines three well researched blood biomarkers to identify and to assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, Amyloid-Tau Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration targeted for patients who are being evaluated from mild dementia. This new test builds the Labcorp's leadership in new neurodegenerative testing options, and gives physicians and easily accessible and interpretable blood test to assess pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Turning to women's health, we announced the new consumer offering for menopause in the quarter. Lapcorp's on demand menopause test, aims to help women understand symptoms and hormonal factors related to menopause so they can have more informed conversations with their providers. Finally, our Biopharma Laboratory services team opened two new international facilities in China, a new kit production facility, and an immunology and immune toxicology laboratory. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, as we discussed at Investors Day, we are excited about the future of Labcorp and our strong financial outlook on a CAGR basis to 2026. We expect overall enterprise revenue growth of 5% to 8%, including 1.5% to 2.5%, from acquisitions. For Diagnostic Laboratories, we expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect Biopharma Laboratory services to grow organically between 4.5% to 7.5%. We're focusing on two significant drivers of near-term growth and differentiation as we move towards those target ranges. The first is to be the partner of choice for health systems, and local or regional laboratories. And the second is to develop to license and ultimately to scale specialty testing, including companion diagnostics. I mentioned the momentum that we have in our health system strategy earlier. We've announced five new agreements this year. Additionally, specialty testing, we are focused on four primary areas, oncology, woman cell, autoimmune disease, and neurology, which we anticipate will outpace the growth of other therapeutic areas. The development of Specialty Tests and Companion Diagnostics makes us attractive partners to health systems and biopharma as they continue to develop more therapies and highest specialty areas. Our scale and our geographic presence will be differentiators for both growth initiatives. We're also well positioned for long term success in Cell & Gene Therapy, expanding into consumer market and international growth through our innovative specialty testing and biopharma business. All this will culminate the top line performance that we expect will exceed $14 billion by the end of 2026. To close, our team of over 60,000 global employees is executing Labcorp's global strategy at scale, and then an exceptional pace repose. As we post 2023, we will continue to capitalize on the momentum that we've created, and drive further value creation for our shareholders. This year has been transformational for Labcorp. We're focused on our growth strategy. And we plan to finish strong as you pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Sure, good morning, Kevin. So, if you look at the third quarter book-to-bill it was a bit light versus the prior quarter. And it was mostly due to small and emerging biotech. And it was mostly due to those customers in our early development, research laboratories. Large pharma, middle sized biotech, which is the majority of our customers in our central laboratories, which is the largest part of our biopharma segment, remain strong. And as I look at fourth quarter, I expect the book-to-bill in fourth quarter to be better than it was in the third quarter. If you look at the trailing 12 months, it was 1.12. And to me, that still remains pretty healthy. If you remember, last quarter, I mentioned that with a clinical development business now being a separate company. You would expect the book-to-bill to be lower. In particular, because in early development, most of those trials are very short-term, they can be one month, three months, they usually start and end in the same year that you have them. So, that's why I feel confident that we'll continue to see progress. I feel that the largest part of our business Central Laboratories remains very strong in RFPs, book-to-bill, and we just have to continue to try to find a way to change our mix a bit in early development. I'd like to move early development to work more with the midsize biotech, maybe some of the pharma companies versus having too much reliance on smaller emerging biotech companies. If you look at the revenue, I felt very good about the revenue in the bio pharma business with 8% revenue growth in the segment for the quarter. And we accept expect to see continued strength in revenue growth. So, again, I'm just looking at the number of RFPs coming through our run rate, and so forth. And based upon what I see, as I sit here today. I expect us to have a better quarter and fourth quarter for book-to-bill in the third quarter. And sometimes book-to-bill is timing related you think you might get a trial the third quarter ends up falling to the fourth. I've always said to be careful to look at any one quarter when it comes to book-to-bill. And that's why we also provide the trailing 12 months. Yeah, Sure, this first one, you know, we're very pleased with the performance in the diagnostic sector, not just when you look at overall revenue, which includes Ascension. But when you look at the base business volume, if you look at that the base business volume was up 7.2%. And about 3.6% was from acquisition. So, it just tells you that the organic base business remains very strong. Our managed care contracting, we're in very good position. We've there finalized or are close to finalizing all of the contracts that were large and need to be renewed. And I would say, you know, there'll be a basically flat to slightly positive, which is a good place for us to be as we move into next year. So, I feel very good about that. You know, we look at metabolic testing. And then we look at all the different types of routine testing. And we haven't, yet we see that growing, but it's growing at consistent rates as it's grown before. And we still see our esoteric testing growing a little bit faster, but almost about the same as our routine testing. And if you look at like our metabolic testing, and so forth, we don't really see an acceleration there. And a lot of the metabolic testing is done in panels. And it's done with other tests, and so forth. So, I wouldn't expect to see a significant change necessarily, with the GLP ones moving forward. But the growth is very broad based. It's across geographies is across routine and esoteric testing. It's across all the different types of testing that we have. So, the underlying dynamics are very strong. Yeah, absolutely. One of the things Patrick we're trying to do is to focus more on the specialty testing, and also thinking about how to expand internationally on things like companion diagnostics. When you think about a mid to large pharma company, as they develop more personalized medicine, they're going to want to have some type of diagnostic tool or companion diagnostic that they can use to develop to identify which patients are most apt to respond to the medicine, but also have it available ultimately, in the marketplace. So, where we're trying to go is to show pharma that they work with us early. We can help them develop their diagnostic tests. We have very strong capabilities and companion diagnostics, and developing specialty diagnostic tests. We can help them do their clinical trials to our Central Laboratories, and do all the companion diagnostic testing, and specialty testing. And ultimately, we want to be able to offer to them, that we can launch that test not only in the United States, but we can help them bring those specialty and companion diagnostic tests to other parts of the world. I think it'd be a very compelling discussion to have with pharma. And we're having some of those discussions as we speak. Thank you. Yeah, I'll ask them to jump in as well. I'd say the largest impact of margins, as I think about 2024 is PAMA. And we've built in about $80 million, almost $80 million of downside into our base case, assuming that PAMA comes next year. We're still trying to see, working with our trade group if there's a way to get the SALSA legislation approved. We have bipartisan support, but we had that last year. So, it's very hard to get things approved right now. We're also going to see if there's a way to delay for another year the implementation, but for our base case, we're assuming that there's about an $80 million impact that would negatively impact the margins next year. That's why we gave the long-term guidance. And we said it's 100 to 150 basis point increase over the time period. We said most of that will be after 2024. Because in 2024, we have to overcome PAMA. Let's wait and see if PAMA doesn't come or if it's delayed, then we'll have some upside there for sure. Good morning, Jack. Yeah, Jack. So, you know, when you look at the macro dynamics, I would say for testing, it remains strong. And when you look at the volume that we're seeing, it remains very strong as well. And it's broad based across the country and esoteric and routine testing. If you go back to historical recessionary periods, the diagnostic business tends to continue to do well through those periods. So, I feel pretty confident that we're going to continue to be see strength there. When it comes to hospitals. You know, I've talked about how the hospital health system but also local and regional laboratory acquisition possibilities remain extraordinarily strong. And I think it's because they're struggling in the economic environment, with reimbursement with wages, and other things. And they're looking for ways that they can get some capital, but also look for people that are like experts in hiring, the types of jobs that we hire for managing the type of people that we manage. So, I think the macro environment for the health systems and for these local smaller regional laboratories is very strong for us to continue to find ways to do business development and find visual partnerships. So, it's actually a good environment for us to compete. But obviously, we want our hospital systems to remain solvent and, you know, they have a lot of things that they have to do to continue to be successful. Thanks for that clarification, we're seeing a similar thing that primarily with NHP trials that were, when there was supply issues, people started to get in line much earlier than they typically would to ensure that they could run their trials as fast as they could. Now that we have supply and so forth, as those clients studies are ready to go, they're not necessarily ready to go. Or they're thinking about their pipeline and other priorities, and so forth, because they booked these spots so far ago. So, that's the primary reason that we believe we're seeing these cancellations in early development. So, if you look, overall, if you just look at the quarter would have been below one. But as again, with early development, I don't think book-to-bill is really a good way to look at that business. Because when it comes to early development, they're one month trial, three months trials, maybe six-month trial, so you can burn through those in the same year. Very quickly, I look at the book-to-bill, you know, because I think it's a historical way to look at the business. But EPS is very small compared to Central Laboratory and the vast majority of our Accentual laboratory work remains very strong. So, that's why I feel confident, as I look at the numbers of the future, because of the size of our Central Laboratory, the mix of customers and Central Laboratories more towards pharma, and big biotech and the book-to-bill it remains pretty good. Yep, absolutely. So, you know, we were supportive of legislation called valid last year that would have given FDA oversight for laboratory developed tests. And it was unfortunate that it didn't get passed last year, had bipartisan support, we were supportive. It's disappointing that legislation didn't go through. So, we're supportive of working with the FDA to find ways for them to give appropriate oversight. We think that our science or innovation or technology capabilities actually differentiate us. And if you look at the rigor that we go through with our laboratory developed tests, we think we do the vast majority of what they would be asking for anyway. Working with ACLA, our trade organization, what we're worried about is if you take legislation that had an intended purpose, for one thing, and then you try to apply it to another thing, you have to be very thoughtful about that. The good news is the FDA has asked for comments, and we're going to provide comments and thoughts. At the end of the day, if it's fairly done, meaning that all laboratory developed tests have to do the same thing across big labs, small labs and everything else, as long as they can get these filings done quickly so that people have access to new innovations in a timely manner, like they do today. We believe that it will be minimal impact to us in terms of the amount of money or spend because we do a lot of that work anyway. With that said, it's less than 10% of our volume. So, laboratory developed tests are not a significant portion of our volume. But sometimes they are the most important test for new specialty areas. And trying to get those to patients quickly is what's most important for them. It's less than 10% of the dollars to when I say less than 100% of the value is. It's less than 5%, frankly. And then the dollar is less than 10%. Yeah, no problem, Tim. So, direct to consumer advertising remains important. Wait for us to enable consumers to monitor and take care of the health. If you look at the dollar volume, especially if you take out the testing for COVID is still very small, and it's not worth it's not material enough to actually break out the numbers. We see it growing very substantially. But it's not necessarily at a point where we would break it out and give specific numbers for it. I think when it comes to consumer testing, we're going to see a lot more rope as we go through the years. At some point, if it reaches that material threshold, Tim will certainly start to break it out. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah thanks, Erin. So, labor environment is tough across industries, across countries. I mean, there's no doubt that the good news is, you know, I look at our retention rates. And if you look at retention from 2019, we saw a significant loss of people and our actual turnover rate was up substantially in 2021 and 2022. If we now look at 2023, we've seen those rates come down in our biopharma business, they've come down almost to the 2019 levels. If you look at our diagnostic business, they're not yet at our 2019 levels, but they're getting closer. And you know, we expect there to be continued progress there. But we have had to pay a bit more in certain areas, we've had to be competitive in the marketplace. It does impact the margins. But at the same time, that's why we've been so aggressive with Launchpad. And we're on track to deliver the $350 million of Launchpad savings that we discussed in the past. We also at Investor Day talked about a $100 million to $125 million year reduction through Launchpad.  And we also mentioned that we have an increase in our margins over the \u201823 to \u201826 period of 100 to 150 basis points, mostly coming after the PAMA year in 2024. So, most of that in \u201825 and \u201826. So, at the end of the day, we realized we've got to find ways to reduce costs. So that we can offset some of the pressure that we're facing when it comes to, you know, the wages and so forth. Yeah, thanks Erin. You know, again, it is a very small part of our business. I mean, if you look at the business as a percent of Labcorp, it's very small, it's less than 10%, frankly. And if you look at it as a percent of the biopharma business, it's maybe 30% or so. So, at the end of the day, it's really Central Laboratory that drives our success and Biopharma. At the same time with the strategic things that we're trying to do with companion diagnostics. And work with pharma earlier, bringing those companion diagnostics to Central Laboratories, and then ultimately bring them to the marketplace. Strategically, I still think it makes sense. And I still think that we could do a lot of other things with our early development that helps us in the broader, bigger business that we have. And we continue to evaluate all things. Yeah. All right. So, we're on target, we said we have this 25 million by the end of this year. So the runway next year, that would be taken out. But I think the most important piece is that that's not enough. And if we're going to do that, plus, we have to do more. So, as I said, we're on track for a $350 million Launchpad initiative. And we've committed to 100 million to 125 million per year, in the outer years, as we look at a long term forecast that includes $25 million of stranded costs, but it just tells you we've got to do a lot more. Yeah, I like to that answer question. In general, I don't see that there'll be a significant shift, in terms of we've always had some seasonality. And if you look at like Central labs, for example, they always start off a little bit slower in the first quarter, because a lot of pharma are starting to get their studies running in third quarter, sometimes a little slower as Europe comes back after vacation. But net-net, you know, there shouldn't be any significant changes to what we've seen in the past. Yeah, we're going to push for the vast majority of it to come down to margin. I mean, there might be some incremental minor investments, but we've got almost $80 million into the plan, and I would expect the vast majority of that to come down. Yeah. So, at this point, we don't think there'll be any disruption to the ATN profile, we've launched it into the marketplace. You know, some managed care organizations are starting to reimburse others we're in discussions with, but a lot of the reimbursement in that area is from providers and the health systems and so forth. So, we expect we'll have good reimbursement from those areas as we go forward. It's still relatively new tasks, we're still have physicians, learning about the panel and so forth. So, it will take time, but over time, we expect it to be reimbursed well. Yeah, absolutely. Brian. So, you know, we've renegotiated the majority of our contracts were really, really finished. And, really close on one last one. But they ended up being very good negotiations, very good discussions, we think that ultimately, it will be flat, maybe slightly positive. So, I feel really good about that. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. Hope you can tell that we remain very optimistic about the prospects for Labcorp as we continue to execute, and we execute well on our strategy, and that we believe our strategy is going to continue to drive substantial shareholder value. Hope everybody has a good rest of the day."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by discussion of our performance in each segment, and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year. Primarily due to organic based business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 14% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 87%. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 10.8% benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the Outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth, Ascension annualized on September 30th. Operating income for the quarter was $252 million, or 8.3% of revenue. During the quarter we had $56 million of amortization and $116 million of restructuring charges and special items due to the spin of Fortrea, COVID acquisitions and Launchpad initiatives. Excluding these items adjusted operating income in the quarter was $424 million, or 13.9% of revenue, compared to $491 million, or 17.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mixed impact from the Ascension lab management agreement. Excluding these items margins would have been flat as the benefit of demand and Launchpad savings were offset by higher personnel expense. Our Launchpad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the three-year period ending 2024. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 19.4% last year. The increase in the adjusted rate was primarily due to higher R&D tax credits realized last year. We continue to expect the fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter from continuing operations were $184 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, adjusted EPS were $3.38 in the quarter, down 16% from last year to the lower COVID testing earnings, as base business adjusted EPS was up approximately 10%. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $276 million in the quarter, which was burdened by approximately $56 million of spin related items. Operating cash flow of $276 million is up from $253 million a year ago due to higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $105 million, up from $83 million last year. For the full year we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $171 million, which was burdened by approximately $56 million of spin related items. The company invested $380 million in acquisitions, paid out $64 million in dividends and used $1 billion for an accelerated share repurchase program that we expect will be completed by year end. At quarter end, we had around $725 million in cash, while debt was $5.4 billion. Our leverage was 2.7 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now review our segment performance beginning with diagnostics laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 3.4% and acquisitions of 3%. The base business grew organically by 12.8% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 87%. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 6% of the growth. Total volume increased 2.3% compared to last year, as acquisition volume grew 3.4% primarily offset by organic volume of minus 1.1% due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 7.2% compared to the base business last year, as organic increased 3.6% for volume, while acquisitions also contributed 3.6%. Price mix increased 3.9% versus last year primarily due to an organic base business increase partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price mix was up 9.2% compared to bass business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 6%. Diagnostics laboratories adjusted operating income for the quarter was $386 million, or 16.5% of revenue compared to $440 million or 19.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to reduction in COVID-19 testing. While the margin was also affected by the mix impact from Ascension. Base business margin excluding the mix, impact of Ascension was up approximately 30 basis points as the benefit of organic growth and Launchpad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense. Now review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $719 million an increase of 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in organic revenue of 4.9% and foreign currency of 3.3%. The 7.9% revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs which was up 9%, while early development was up 5.7%.  While early development is no longer constrained by NHP availability, it has experienced higher than normal cancellations and lower orders, primarily due to small biotech funding. Biopharma Laboratory Services adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $105 million or 15.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to stranded costs as a result of a spin of Fortrea which is timing related.  Excluding stranded cost margins were up in the third quarter. As the benefit of top line growth and Launchpad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. We expect margins in the fourth quarter to be up sequentially and year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.8 billion, and we expect approximately $2.4 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.12. Now discuss our 2023 full year guidance which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2023 for the remainder of the year. The Enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions share repurchases and dividends. In addition, the guidance includes the impact from the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was funded with proceeds from the spin.  With regard to our 2023 full year guidance, we've narrowed the ranges but have maintained the same midpoint from our prior guidance for Enterprise revenue, earnings and cash flow. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.9% to 2.7% compared to 2022. This increase reflects the base business growing 11.5% to 12.2%. While COVID testing is expected to decline 85% to 86%. We expect Diagnostics Laboratories revenue to be up 1.5% to 2% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 14.1% to 14.6%, which includes approximately 5% growth from Ascension. The base business has improved from our prior guidance as acquisition related revenue that was forecasted at the enterprise level is now reflected in the segment as we've closed those transactions. We continue to expect Diagnostics Laboratories base business margin to be up slightly in 2023 versus 2022 including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect Biopharma Laboratory Services revenue to grow 3.1% to 4% compared to 2022. Excluding the change in currency translation at negative 20 basis points, the midpoint of the guidance range remains unchanged from our prior guidance, we expect the revenue growth rate to continue to improve in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect margins for the full year to be flat to slightly up, while the fourth quarter is expected to see both sequential and year-over-year improvement. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $13.25 to $13.75, unchanged at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin related items is expected to be between $850 to $950 million. Also unchanged from our prior guidance at the midpoint. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, we expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth will also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and dividends. Operator we'll now take questions. Yeah, Patrick, just I guess, as you look to the two businesses, we feel good about where we are with the margins, they continue to improve on a base business level. As we think about going into the fourth quarter. We commented that within the biopharma side, we expect margins to be up in the fourth quarter and year-on-year, such that for the full year, there'll be flat to slightly up. In diagnostics, obviously, we have seasonality that impacts margins of fourth quarter sequentially, margins will be down, but they'll still be up year-over-year. So, that we expect diagnostics margins for the full year, to be up slightly, even after absorbing the negative impact from the Ascension mix. As Adam commented in the 100, to call it 150 basis point margin improvement that we expect over the next three years. We commented that the first-year margins would be relatively flat, we have around a 70-basis point headwind, if you will, between the combination of lower COVID testing, as well as the PAMA headwind that that Adam commented, but that's reflected still in the three-year expectation that margins would grow that 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Yeah, no, Jack. Again, when we basically reaffirmed kind of our outlook for this year as well as our three years when we were at the Analyst Day, we knew there was some softness we had experienced within early development earlier. So, that continues, but as Adam said, kind of offset by the strength that we're seeing with on the Central lab side. So, for Biopharma, and for Diagnostic segments, we feel very good. So, if you look at call it that 8.5% to 11.5% EPS target over the next three years, the CAGR, we still feel very good about that, realizing that for 2024, because again of the headwinds from less COVID testing and PAMA, you'd have around 800 basis point headwind to EPS in 2024. So, still positive EPS growth year-on-year even with those headwinds, but lower than, if you will, the range that we had, but again, that three-year range includes that expectation for 2024. Sure. Hey Tim, this is Glenn. That's right, we would agree that your 320 is in line with the, call it the organic price mix favorability excluding the impact that we would get from Ascension. You know, from a pricing standpoint, we continue to say pricing is kind of flat, maybe a little bit of a headwind. You heard Adam earlier in the future with the renewals of the managed care contracts, you know, that actually is a positive for us. But most of the time that favorability in our price mix continues to be on the mix side, we continue to see favorability in our tests per session, you know, whether the payer mix test mix with a lot of things esoteric relative to routine. So, we continue to experience good favorable price mix, but more on the mix side. Yeah, that's right. And the numbers that we've provided historically have been restated for the company we are today. So, you can look at our enhanced disclosures that we have that you'll see some historical numbers. But the other interesting thing is, the seasonality of the two segments are a little bit counter to each other. So, it actually when you look at it from an enterprise level, mutes the seasonality for each of the businesses. Well, again, a lot of the, the expectation is that we're looking at good top line growth. So, we would expect to leverage off of that Launchpad savings that we've identified as well, and then being offset by labor and potentially continued inflationary environment. You know, for us, we talk a lot about labor, because it represents around 50% of our cost structure. So, we're very focused on it. And as Adam said, we are seeing some improvement in the attrition levels, but it's still higher than where it's been in the past. And there's a cost to that, let alone just the labor wage rates inflation, if you will, but all that's been factored in. So, to the extent we can continue to drive the top line that we feel confident about, and realize the Launchpad savings, which we feel confident about, we equally expect to see that margin improvement."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Labcorp\u2019s Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Chas Cook, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today\u2019s call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on the company\u2019s businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the spin-off of Fortrea and its treatment as discontinued operations and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. Before I cover our second quarter results, I want to first thank Chas for his leadership in Investor Relations over the last several years. Chas will be moving into the role of Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis effective in August. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Kristin O\u2019Donnell, an accomplished leader in our finance organization, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations. Both Chas and Kristin will be in attendance at our upcoming Investor Day on September 14, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person. Beginning this quarter, Labcorp is reporting results without the inclusion of Fortrea, which is now an independent, publicly held company as a result of our successful spin on June 30. Moving forward, we\u2019ll report our laboratory services business under two segments, LabCorp Diagnostics Laboratories and Labcorp biopharma laboratory services. Biopharma laboratory services consists of two businesses: our Central Laboratories business, which represents about 70% of segment revenue and Early Development Research Laboratories, which although smaller, is also a leader in the market. In the second quarter, Labcorp delivered exceptional year-over-year growth in our Diagnostics Laboratories base business and generated strong growth in Central Laboratories. Early Development Research Laboratories continue to be constrained by industry-related supply chain issues that we expect to be resolved in the third quarter. We entered the second half of the year with clear operational focus and enhanced financial flexibility to advance our strategy. We see strong momentum in the base business and are excited about the growth opportunities before us. Now let\u2019s discuss our second quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $3.42, and free cash flow from continuing operations was $177 million. Our business is performing well with overall revenue increasing 4% compared to prior year. Base business revenue grew 13% to prior year. Diagnostics Laboratories\u2019 base business revenue grew 16%, driven by both strong base business volume and Ascension. For Biopharma Laboratory Services, Second quarter revenue grew 3%, driven by Central Laboratories business, which grew 9%, partially offset by Early Development Research Laboratories, which was down 7% due to NHP supply constraints. We expect Early Development Research Laboratories to grow in the second half of the year versus prior year, and we do not expect impact from NHP supply constraints for the rest of the year. Enterprise base business margin was slightly down compared to the prior year due to the impact of Ascension, which we discussed previously. Diagnostic Laboratories base business margin increased versus prior year if you exclude Ascension. And Biopharma Laboratory Services margins expanded, benefiting from Central Laboratory strong volume increases. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results as well as our updated 2023 outlook in just a moment. As we mentioned at the top of the call, we completed the spin of Fortrea business on June 30. We I want to thank both the Labcorp and Fortrea teams for their tireless efforts in achieving this milestone that positions us to better meet customer needs and delivers immediate value to our shareholders. We announced that we\u2019ll begin an accelerated $1 billion share repurchase program. We\u2019ll pay off $300 million in maturing debt and we\u2019ll utilize the remainder of the $1.6 billion dividend to Labcorp from Fortrea to be returned to shareholders through additional future share purchases and/or cash dividends. The completion of the spin brings the growth opportunities of our laboratory businesses into full focus. We are poised to leverage our deep science, technology and innovative laboratory network to drive growth, and to deliver superior solutions to our customers. We are also in a very strong position operationally to advance our laboratory business. Here are several recent examples where we progressed our enterprise strategy in the second quarter. We continue to drive growth through health care system partnerships. Earlier this month, we finalized our strategic relationship with Jefferson Health, one of the largest health systems serving the Greater Philadelphia area in Southern New Jersey. This new collaboration will focus on future research and innovations to improve health outcomes. In May, we announced the next step in our long-standing relationship with Providence Health and Services to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select assets in Oregon. This transaction builds on our more than 20-year history with the Providence family of organizations. Finally, earlier in July, we announced a comprehensive lab relationship with Legacy Health in Portland, Oregon. Under this agreement, Labcorp will acquire select assets of its outreach laboratory business, including laboratory facilities and equipment and manage Legacy\u2019s inpatient hospital laboratories. These relationships create immediate value for hospital systems for patients, for communities, while also providing significant growth opportunities for Labcorp. The partnerships meet our criteria of being accretive to earnings and cash in the first year. Although the margins are typically lower than the company average early on, they do improve over time. We are also pleased with our progress integrating hospital partnerships and acquisitions. For example, with Ascension, which we announced in 2022, we continue to see reduced employee turnover and improved performance due to our partnership. This scalable model connects our two mission-driven organizations to provide care teams with information to make the best possible decisions for patients. We continue to look for regional laboratory acquisitions in geographies where we can increase access to diagnostics and expand capabilities. As an example, this week, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Enzo Biochem\u2019s Clinical Laboratory division in New Jersey, which serves the New York tristate health care communities. We have a very robust pipeline of potential hospital and local laboratory acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to focus energy and resources on this important opportunity for growth. Additionally, we\u2019re investing in innovation and technology that supports diagnostic and drug development testing across disease areas, including cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases. In May, we commercially launched a new liquid biopsy test, enabling target therapy selection for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The Labcorp Plasma Focus test allows oncologists to better evaluate tumor cells and manage the care of patients through a precision therapy plan. Additionally, our portfolio of kits [ph] solutions from the acquisition of PGDx is gaining momentum with major health systems and academic centers. Our solutions can enable operational and financial efficiencies that are making us a key partner for hospital and health systems as they execute on their precision medicine programs. Recently, we were first laboratory to launch a test for pTau-181 in plasma, an important blood test for potential Alzheimer\u2019s patients demonstrating symptoms of dementia. Our teams are at the forefront of Alzheimer\u2019s testing as the number of people impacted by this disease is expected to double over the next two decades. In April, we broke ground on the expansion project of our new Central Laboratory facility in Japan. When complete at the end of 2024, the facility will enhance our Central Laboratory testing capabilities to support drug development. We also opened two new facilities in China, a new kit production facility in Suzhou and an immunology and immunotoxicology lab in Shanghai. In addition, we delivered impactful digital solutions to help our customers understand, manage and improve their health. As part of our commitment to improving the customer experience, we launched an advanced e-commerce platform to improve consumer engagement with Labcorp. The platform will support all of our businesses including Labcorp on demand, which offers consumers access to many of Labcorp\u2019s innovative tests online nationwide. Lastly, I speak on behalf of the entire management team, when I say that we are excited about our upcoming Investor Day on September 14 in New York City. This event will highlight our go-forward strategy, offer business overviews and provide a longer-term financial outlook. We have a value creation road map that we are excited to share. Today marks a new chapter in our company\u2019s history. We have a team of more than 60,000 global employees with united focus. Labcorp\u2019s base business is performing very well. We\u2019re executing on our growth strategy, and we\u2019re leveraging Labcorp\u2019s financial strength as well as operational focus to improve health, to improve lives while also increasing shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I\u2019m going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we\u2019ve also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.  With the spin completed on June 30, we have treated Fortrea as discontinued operations in the second quarter. All of my comments will reflect the current business and have been adjusted to exclude Fortrea in prior periods for comparative purposes. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 3.8% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 12.7% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 88% and as we performed an average of 3,000 PCR tests per day in the quarter. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 10.8% and benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 5% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition, while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth. Operating income for the quarter was $266 million or 8.8% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $52 million of amortization and $131 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to the spin of Fortrea acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $448 million or 14.8% of revenue compared to $548 million or 18.7% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mix impact from the Ascension lab management agreement. Excluding these items, margins would have been up slightly as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense and increased R&D investments in oncology. Our LaunchPad initiatives continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the three-year period ending 2024. In addition, the company is implementing actions in the third quarter to take out $25 million of annualized stranded costs throughout the enterprise as a result of the spin. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 25.3% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to R&D tax credits. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter from continuing operations were $155 million or $1.74 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.42 in the quarter, down 15% from last year due to lower COVID testing earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up approximately 18%. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $280 million in the quarter, which was burdened by approximately $65 million of spin-related items. Operating cash flow of $280 million is down from $548 million a year ago, primarily due to lower COVID testing earnings and spin-related items. In addition, higher working capital requirements that are timing related were partially offset by higher base business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $103 million, down from $140 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $177 million, including approximately $65 million of spin-related items. The company invested $137 million in acquisitions and paid out $65 million in dividends. While the company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter, we announced a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to put in place in the third quarter and be completed by year end. At quarter end, we had $1.9 billion in cash, including the $1.6 billion dividend from Fortrea spin, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 2.6 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now I\u2019ll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3.8% compared to last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 1.8% and acquisitions of 2.2%. The base business grew organically by 13.5% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 88%. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth. Total volume increased 1.4% compared to last year as acquisition volume grew 2.5%, partially offset by organic volume of minus 1.1% due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 8.1% compared to the base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.7%. The strong year-over-year growth rate was also aided by lower-than-normal volume in the second quarter of 2022 due to Omicron. Price/mix increased 2.4% versus last year, primarily due to organic base business growth of 6.8%, partially offset by lower code testing of 3.9%. Base business organic price/mix was up 8% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics Laboratories adjusted operating income for the quarter was $410 million or 17.5% of revenue compared to $516 million or 22.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing, while the margin decline was also negatively impacted by the mix impact from Ascension. Base business margin, excluding the mix impact of Ascension was up approximately 40 basis points as the benefit of organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense. Now I\u2019ll review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $699 million, an increase of 3.1% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in organic revenue of 2.1% and foreign currency of 1.5%. The increase in organic revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 5% due to the previously communicated NHP related supply constraints in our Early Development Research Laboratories business. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $105 million or 15% of revenue compared to $93 million or 13.7% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense. We ended the quarter with backlog of $8 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; in addition, the guidance includes the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program with proceeds from the spin. Excluding Fortrea, our current enterprise guidance for revenue, earnings and cash flow remains unchanged from our prior guidance given in April. Enterprise revenue is in line with Diagnostics Laboratories slightly up while Biopharma Laboratory Services is slightly down. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.5% to 3% compared to 2022. This increase reflects the base business growing 11.3% to 12.6%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 85% to 89%. We expect Diagnostics Laboratories revenue to be up 0.5% to 1.5% compared to 2022. This is a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint from our April guidance as the base business outlook has improved, partially offset by lower COVID testing. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 13.2% to 14.2%, which includes approximately 5% growth from Ascension. The base business has improved from our April guidance based on stronger demand. We continue to expect Diagnostics Laboratories base business margin to be slightly up in 2023 versus 2022 and including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect Biopharma Laboratory Services revenue to grow 3% to 4.5% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 150 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance range is down approximately 75 basis points from the midpoint of our April guidance, but implies around 9.5% growth in the second half of the year as we expect favorable growth in both Central Laboratories and Early Development Research Laboratories. We also expect that the segment margin will be flat to slightly up in 2023 compared to 2022. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS and is $13 to $14, which is consistent with our April guidance, excluding Fortrea and including the impact from the accelerated share repurchase program. Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related items, is expected to be between $800 million to $1 billion, in line with our prior guidance, excluding Fortrea. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: My questions are on the new Biopharma Lab Services segment. So number one, was curious if you could comment on just how much visibility you have into the improvement you\u2019re looking for in the second half of the year for Early Development Research Labs? And just give us an update in terms of the supply situation for NHPs.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So, first of all, I\u2019ll answer the second part first. So, we\u2019re in good shape for the rest of the year with NHP. We don\u2019t expect any additional impact as we go through the second half. And then to answer the first question, if you just look at the midpoint of our guidance, it would imply about a 9.5% increase year-over-year. And that\u2019s going to come from both segments, the NHP segment as well as from the Clinical Laboratory \u2013 the Early Development Research Laboratory as well as the Clinical Research Laboratory segments.\nJack Meehan: Great. Okay. And then maybe for Glenn, just for the segment overall, could you talk about expectations for the second half margin ramp in Biopharma Lab Services and just how we should be \u2013 if you can hear me any thoughts on the leaping off point for 2024?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, hi Jack. So, when we think about margins, again, specifically for Biopharma, obviously, we expect to see a second half margin year improve over the first half and improve year-over-year. So, again, benefiting from the top line growth that Adam said was kind of in the implied revenue growth of 9.5% for the segment, we\u2019ll get good leverage over that as well as benefiting from LaunchPad. We said that for the full year for Biopharma, margins will be flat to slightly up, again, consistent with, frankly, Diagnostics margins being up a little bit and for the enterprise as well, including the negative impact from Ascension. So, we feel good about margins driven off of the top line. When you look at the quarter, we felt actually very good with a 15% margin in the quarter for Biopharma, realizing that we had very strong growth coming from Central Lab that really helped it, but also we had negative growth from Early Development Research, which constrained it. So, we feel good about where we are kind of as a run rate. And if we can maintain that level of margin, that will get us, again, higher margins for the full year as well as year-over-year.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Lisa.\nLisa Gill: Good morning. It\u2019s nice to talk to you guys again. Thanks for taking my questions. When I look at your expectations and I look at the revenue growth rate, can you talk about utilization trends? Do you think that there is still some level of pent-up demand? How do I think about this versus 2019 baseline would be kind of my utilization question? And then secondly, how do I think about reimbursement trends, especially on the managed care side. I know two years ago we talked a lot about shifts towards some type of value-based economics. Are we finally there? And if so, can you maybe talk about some of the things that you're seeing in the market?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. I'll let Glenn answer the first question. I'll take the second one. Lisa, if you look at the reimbursement trends, what I would say is that it continues to be a relatively stable environment. And I feel good about our interactions with the payers, I feel good about our contracts that we have in place. I wouldn't say yet we're there for value-based contracts and so forth. I think there's still a lot of experimentation that happens, but we don't see a lot of significant progress. With all that said, I believe that we're in a very good position moving forward with the payers, and there's nothing that I would expect to be unexpected. What we're watching closely obviously is PAMA to see what happens there and government reimbursement on certain areas. But overall, it remains a pretty healthy environment.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. And Lisa, on the utilization; so as you think about the quarter, obviously from a base business organic standpoint we were up 13.5%, so obviously very strong growth when you look year-on-year, but including the benefit from Ascension. So think about kind of the same-store sales, if you will, growth, excluding the impact of Ascension we're up around 7%, so higher than normal growth rates in part given the comp that we would have had a year ago. And of that around 5.5% of that is coming from our volume and the other 1.5%, call it from favorable price mix. So as you think about it relative to 2019 kind of pre-pandemic, are we tracking at a more normal level, we would say we are now. If you look at the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019, again that 7% year-on-year growth this year would have been more like around a 4% compound growth rate compared to 2019, with volume in between, call it, 1%, 1.5% growth rate compared to 2019. So as we think about volume normally historically at 1% to 2%, we're kind of sitting squarely in the middle of that. So it says we're tracking more normal, but the year-over-year is benefiting from some softness last year.\nLisa Gill: That's helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open/\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, A.J.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Maybe just asking, I know a discussion point over the last year has been labor. I just wondered if there is updated thoughts on whether the pressure points in the last year are still the same. Is there any updated thoughts on general average wage increases? And I wanted to just make sure I understood on that $25 million of stranded cost; is that in the Biopharma Lab Services? Or is that how somewhere else? And what's the time frame for winding that down?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll start with labor, A.J. I mean, obviously labor has been an issue that I think all of health care has been struggling with a bit since COVID. What I would say is if we look at our turnover rates, although they're still higher than they were prior to COVID, they actually look better this year than they did last year, and we're seeing some improvement. Wage inflation continues to be an issue, and we continue to use LaunchPad savings to offset that as best we can. As we look at the $25 million stranded costs that we're going to be removing, it's enterprise-wide. By the end of this year we'll be on the run rate to remove that for next year. But importantly, we're still committed to the $350 million of LaunchPad savings that we've talked about in the past despite the fact that we no longer have the clinical business, where some of that cost savings obviously would have come from. So we are going to continue to look for ways to reduce costs across the enterprise to offset some of the other pressures that we've talked about.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. A.J., just adding to that and more specifically, the $25 million of annualized cost, stranded costs that will take out this year to your point, while it will be throughout the whole enterprise. Obviously, a lot of it initially will come from the Biopharma segment. So this is the, call it the support that we have at the segment level that's supporting was all three of the businesses that included the Fortrea business now supporting the two. So we'll look to take out a lot of those stranded costs. In addition, we'll take out some stranded costs that's in corporate unallocated that wouldn't have been allocated to any of the businesses. Having said that, when you look at our corporate unallocated number we did around $66 million in the quarter, we have been seeing an increase in that relative to the R&D investments we're making in oncology. So very targeted investments that will kind of be offset that growth by some of the costs coming out of corporate and allocated due to stranded. So as we think about the run rate of corporate unallocated, that $66 million should still hold true, so it's roughly around 2.2% of our revenues. So as we think longer term, in addition to the $25 million that we're taking out, which is more of a short-term cost to take out of the stranded, we feel there's also some other opportunities to take out additional costs within the corporate unallocated as we go forward and then obviously look to see the company through organic growth as well as acquisition growth. As we grow as a company, we'll be able to leverage the infrastructure and the cost structure we have there even more.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is now open.\nAdam Schechter: Eric, good morning.\nEric Coldwell: Hey good morning. First, if you don't mind, I'm going to ask two. On the $25 million cost action, the incremental does that represent \u2013 what portion of the stranded cost does that represent? I assume it's not the full amount, but could you tell us how that stacks up compared to the total?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. There's about $45 million of stranded cost, give or take a couple of million. And we're going to \u2013 we have a path forward, and we've identified the $25 million of that.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. Perfect. And then my first question was really going back to the NHP. Surprising to hear you say you don't expect a headwind or have no issues there in the back half. I'm curious how that is? Is it due to new supply access that you've been able to get your hands on? Is it pricing? Has something changed in the market that's allowing you to work around the obvious Cambodian issue? Just curious more on the mechanics of how you do not see a headwind from NHPs in the back half?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, Eric. First thing I'd say is as we look at the studies that we have for the back half, we already have the NHPs that we need to support the studies. When we first realized this issue, we immediately began to look for alternative suppliers to ensure that we would have capacity. The reason it took us through the first half of this year is because even when you receive the NHPs, there's an acclimation period before you can utilize them in study. So we've worked through that and based upon what we have today, we feel confident in NHP trials going through the second half of the year, which is why at the midpoint of the guidance, we feel comfortable of 9.5% for the Biopharma Laboratory business.\nEric Coldwell: Is there a \u2013 Adam, is there a pricing component on top of that, that would be incremental year-over-year that perhaps the volume is not quite equivalent to last year, but with additional pricing you're getting to, you're able to not have- a year-over-year headwind?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So what I would say is it is more costly today for NHPs than it was in the past. Much of that cost can be passed on to the customer. With that said, however, the margin on that cost is not able to be passed along. So it does impact margin a bit, but it doesn't impact us negatively. We can pass upon the increased cost.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey good morning, guys. Just one question. I really appreciate the color that you've shared on the \u2013 on your progress or success with hospital partnerships. Just curious what those incremental conversations are with, and what the pipeline looks like? And what are hospitals looking for now as they try to figure out lab strategy and who to partner with because obviously you're not just the only one looking for deals in this space? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thanks Brian and good morning. We're excited about the success that we've had with the hospital partnerships. I mentioned the three just in this last quarter that we were able to move forward with Jefferson legacy and an additional part of Providence. And the pipeline remains very strong. As I look at the pipeline of potential hospital [indiscernible], I'm excited about the opportunities before us. I think the hospitals are looking for several things. First and foremost, you have to be able to give them patient continuity. They need to make sure that there's no impact to their patients if they do a laboratory agreement. Second thing is science innovation technology; they want to find ways to actually get better science, get better information faster so that they can get better patient care as they move forward. The third thing that they're obviously looking for is to ensure that there is the ability to kind of have a long-term relationship. So I mentioned Providence, a 20-year relationships, these are long-term deals. They take a long time to get up and running and you want to make sure you choose the right partner that's going to be a long-term partner. And as I look forward into the future, this will be a significant area of focus for Labcorp as I think it represents a tremendous growth opportunity.\nBrian Tanquilut: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Caliendo: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to make sure I understand the bridge. You said that your guidance is unchanged, excluding Fortrea and excluding the ASR, which is going to start sometime in the third quarter. But that also includes $45 million of stranded costs, $25 million of which are going to come out, and maybe higher labor expenses. I guess is there anything else? Is there any contribution from Enzo or lower COVID or anything else that's changed from your assumptions when you provided it in April? Just trying to bridge to get to where we are and if those are the only inputs that we should be thinking about?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, go ahead, Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So, hi, Kevin. So you're right. So as we went back and obviously looked at the current outlook, we said that overall at the enterprise level consistent at the midpoint with revenues, earnings, cash flow and we obviously talked a bit about some pluses and minuses within the businesses that made up that at the enterprise level, where we were excluding Fortrea, when you work down to the earnings similar. So we had the earnings that we would have had in our outlook. We backed out the earnings in April, if you will, taking out Fortrea, but obviously we had the cash from the spin that we added back in there. And so from an earnings and then similar cash flow at the $900 million free cash flow from continuing ops, again, excluding spend, excluding Fortrea; so all of those would have been in line with the expectations that we had in April. When you look at acquisitions to Enzo in particular. So Enzo, we talked about that free cash flow in our guidance, the free cash flow we generated in the year is between M&A, share repurchases and dividends. So there's a portion of that capital, that's an M&A that we include in the enterprise revenues and that we don't include it in the segment revenues until those transactions are actually completed and then we move them down, wouldn't change the enterprise number, but it will affect if you will kind of a segment. Similarly, with lower COVID than what we were expecting in April, that's being absorbed by stronger base business demand in diagnostics. So favorable diagnostics on the upside, a little softness within the biopharma services and a little softness in COVID, but netting out to the enterprise. So that's how we kind of come back to the consistency, if you will, if they're in lines with the pluses and minuses. And LaunchPad again we talked about is continuing on track. So when we think about the labor markets, really no change in our viewpoint from labor. I mean, frankly, our attrition rates are tracking better than they have been a year ago, even though it's still higher than what we would have seen pre-pandemic. The cost \u2013 the inflationary costs really haven't changed much from where we were thinking they would be in April. So that's, frankly, we would say kind of in line with where we would have thought. So overall, we feel, again, good about what we thought our businesses were going to do this year continues to be that same pace.\nKevin Caliendo: That's super helpful. If I can ask a quick follow-up to Eric's question. I understand that you have visibility on the second half for NHP in early stage and that may have been a run through from the first half and with some of the delays in the supply. I guess my question is what's happening to demand going forward? Like I know you had visibility on these contracts. But what's happening with demand beyond that as you look forward into 2024 or the second half of the year for new business? And what's happening with the pricing in that market now with the supply coming back online?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So let me give you some context, and I'll start broad, but then I'll narrow it down to the exact answer your question. Broadly, if you look across Biopharma Laboratories, we feel good about the book of business that we have. We have a book-to-bill of 1.22 trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.22. And it's important to note with the new mix of business that we have, having early development and having our essential laboratories, a book-to-bill 1.1 to 1.2 is healthy. So the book-to-bill is healthy. If we look at our central laboratory business and orders and RFPs, it continues to be very strong and robust. If we look at our early development, we still continue to have a significant number of RFPs about the same as what we've seen before. But in the very emerging and smaller biotechs, we are seeing some pressure particularly as some of them are canceling studies and so forth. Overall, we continue to see very good demand as we walk into next year. When we look at our trailing 12-month book-to-bill, it gives us significant confidence as we go into next year. And the good news is that if you look at the business overall, we are very much skewed towards large pharma, large biotech when you look at the overall laboratory business.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Derik.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning. This is actually John on for Derik.\nAdam Schechter: Hello John.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning. So you talked about your capital allocation. Of course, there's a share repurchase of $1 billion, there are dividends to be paid, and you've talked about the outreach labs and inpatient hospital labs that you've acquired. I wanted to ask what other kinds of assets you're looking at, perhaps in terms of the field in advanced diagnostics beyond PGDx.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thanks for the question. And you're exactly right, our capital allocation, we focus right now we have a $1 billion accelerated repo program. We've got our dividend that we're committed to. We're going to pay down some maturing debt. And at the same time, we have significant opportunity with hospital laboratories as well as local laboratories as well. And that's the primary focus of what we see in the near-term. I don't see us doing anything that would be a significant deal outside of our core expertise. We're focused on our core and maximizing our core. And as I look at the other parts of our business, I feel like we have a good portion of what we need. There doesn't seem to be anything strategically that we're missing. So it's really going to be about the hospital, local laboratories primarily.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate that. And you briefly mentioned PAMA. So wanted to ask what your expectations for PAMA for the forthcoming years? And any updated thoughts on SALSA as well?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So we are hopeful that there's a path forward on SALSA. ACLA, the trade organization is working on that. But at the same time we realized that we've got to be prepared in case PAMA does get implemented again next year. So when we think about next year, we've built into a plan about $75 million of downside due to PAMA. I'm hoping that we won't realize that, but we have to create our business model, assuming that does occur and have our cost base reflected what we would do if that does happen. I am optimistic that people realize the importance of our industry, the importance of what we do. And therefore, PAMA will not be implemented in the way it has in the past, but that's not what we're planning for as we look forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Patrick. Thanks for the question.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey. How are you? Maybe just a quick one on Ascension; can you just talk about how that's tracking both on the revenue side? And then you mentioned, obviously the margin piece, I know it's a big focus in terms of ramping that up to corporate average and then some. So I would love just an update on Ascension, how you're tracking and the cost side as well?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll start, and then Glenn can add some commentary. So we're very pleased with the relationship that we have with Ascension and how the deal is progressing. In particular, the integration is going very, very well. We've given kind of a sense of $550 million to $600 million is what we expect the revenue to be. I would say it's probably contributing more towards the higher end of that than the lower end of that. And if you look at the margins, we said it was going to start up at the low-single-digits and then get to the mid-single digits after the first year, and it's certainly on track to do that. And then we expect next year and the following years for the margin to continue to improve. Ultimately, because of the mix of Ascension being heavily towards managing their laboratories, the margin will never get to our average margin, but it will continue to improve over time.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is that when you think about, again what's changed in our outlook a little bit, part of that is the benefit of Ascension. As Adam said, we're clearly towards the upper or at the upper end of the expectations we had, so improved on the volume side. And then in addition from a margin standpoint, while we're initially expecting, call it that low-to-mid-single digits we're tracking well there as we get that additional volume coming through with momentum taking us into the rest of the year.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] Pito, your line is now open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Pito.\nKieran Ryan: Hi there. Hi there. You've got Kieran Ryan on for Pito. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to go back to the biopharma book-to-bill real quick; it sounds like you're happy with where that metric is. I know the quarterly number came in at 1.06, so up a little bit sequentially, still down versus kind of historical. But it sounds like from the commentary you gave that maybe we shouldn't expect much like a huge rebound in that metric in the back half even as early development starts to accelerate?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So if you look at our trend in 12 months, it's 1.23; and that's a very healthy book-to-bill, particularly for the businesses that we have. Early development typically would have a lower book-to-bill because the studies burn much faster and you can actually have studies that start and finish within a given year. So anything between a 1.1 and a 1.2, we consider to be healthy. And as we look forward, we continue to feel that there's plenty of opportunities, the RFPs continue to look good, so we're optimistic about where we're seeing the book to-go.\nKieran Ryan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our final question comes from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Daley: Hey, thank you. Hi, everybody. Just wanted to get a bit more detail on the capital deployment strategy, specifically related to international. So highlighted the Biopharma Lab services expansion in Japan and China, adding footprint on central lab and early development there. I think just using some of the previous disclosures, I know it's tough to get to, but it does seem like a lot of the Asia exposure went with the clinical business. Is this a pointed strategy that try to gain some footprint back in Asia? Is this longer term, where \u2013 what do you \u2013 how do you think about the international footprint of the Bio segment; where you want to be capability-wise and scale?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Tim. And the things that we announced today, obviously we had those underway for quite some time to plan and prepare for, so that's irrespective of the clinical business or not. At the end of the day when you think about China, Japan, that's the second and third largest market in the world for pharma. So you need to have a very strong presence to have the capability to meet the needs of the pharmaceutical clients and the biotechnology clients. So it's just our way for us to continue to meet those customer needs. And we've done a lot in the past in terms of ensuring that we have a global presence, and I feel good about the global presence that we have today. We are significantly further ahead, particularly with our central laboratory business than we were before.\nTim Daley: All right. Got it. And then just a kind of housekeeping one here. Now that we've got the new structure for the segments, how should we be thinking about communication guidance for the two thinking about growth, sub-segments, margins, any \u2013 any color kind of regular KPIs for us going forward?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Hi, Tim. What you'll see is that consistent with what we've done before. So the same metrics that we provided for the two segments will continue. Obviously, Biopharma Laboratory Services now consists of the two versus the three businesses. But you'll see in the enhanced disclosures that we provided, we continue to do a breakout of the individual businesses. And that from the segment standpoint we give guidance for their top line for the year. We provide, obviously in our remarks the trailing 12 months, which is really where we focus on book-to-bill and backlog and orders. But in the enhanced disclosures, we also provide that on a quarterly basis, so none of the changes from where we've been providing before.\nTim Daley: Alright. Great. And congrats, Chas. I look forward to working with you, Christen [ph].\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Adam Schechter for closing remarks, please.\nAdam Schechter: All right. Thank you, everybody for joining us today. And we really do look forward to sharing more with all of you at our Investor Day in September. So we look forward to that time. We wish you, in the meantime a very happy and healthy summer, and we'll see you in September.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. Before I cover our second quarter results, I want to first thank Chas for his leadership in Investor Relations over the last several years. Chas will be moving into the role of Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis effective in August. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Kristin O'Donnell, an accomplished leader in our finance organization, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations. Both Chas and Kristin will be in attendance at our upcoming Investor Day on September 14, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person. Beginning this quarter, Labcorp is reporting results without the inclusion of Fortrea, which is now an independent, publicly held company as a result of our successful spin on June 30. Moving forward, we'll report our laboratory services business under two segments, LabCorp Diagnostics Laboratories and Labcorp biopharma laboratory services. Biopharma laboratory services consists of two businesses: our Central Laboratories business, which represents about 70% of segment revenue and Early Development Research Laboratories, which although smaller, is also a leader in the market. In the second quarter, Labcorp delivered exceptional year-over-year growth in our Diagnostics Laboratories base business and generated strong growth in Central Laboratories. Early Development Research Laboratories continue to be constrained by industry-related supply chain issues that we expect to be resolved in the third quarter. We entered the second half of the year with clear operational focus and enhanced financial flexibility to advance our strategy. We see strong momentum in the base business and are excited about the growth opportunities before us. Now let's discuss our second quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $3.42, and free cash flow from continuing operations was $177 million. Our business is performing well with overall revenue increasing 4% compared to prior year. Base business revenue grew 13% to prior year. Diagnostics Laboratories' base business revenue grew 16%, driven by both strong base business volume and Ascension. For Biopharma Laboratory Services, Second quarter revenue grew 3%, driven by Central Laboratories business, which grew 9%, partially offset by Early Development Research Laboratories, which was down 7% due to NHP supply constraints. We expect Early Development Research Laboratories to grow in the second half of the year versus prior year, and we do not expect impact from NHP supply constraints for the rest of the year. Enterprise base business margin was slightly down compared to the prior year due to the impact of Ascension, which we discussed previously. Diagnostic Laboratories base business margin increased versus prior year if you exclude Ascension. And Biopharma Laboratory Services margins expanded, benefiting from Central Laboratory strong volume increases. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results as well as our updated 2023 outlook in just a moment. As we mentioned at the top of the call, we completed the spin of Fortrea business on June 30. We I want to thank both the Labcorp and Fortrea teams for their tireless efforts in achieving this milestone that positions us to better meet customer needs and delivers immediate value to our shareholders. We announced that we'll begin an accelerated $1 billion share repurchase program. We'll pay off $300 million in maturing debt and we'll utilize the remainder of the $1.6 billion dividend to Labcorp from Fortrea to be returned to shareholders through additional future share purchases and/or cash dividends. The completion of the spin brings the growth opportunities of our laboratory businesses into full focus. We are poised to leverage our deep science, technology and innovative laboratory network to drive growth, and to deliver superior solutions to our customers. We are also in a very strong position operationally to advance our laboratory business. Here are several recent examples where we progressed our enterprise strategy in the second quarter. We continue to drive growth through health care system partnerships. Earlier this month, we finalized our strategic relationship with Jefferson Health, one of the largest health systems serving the Greater Philadelphia area in Southern New Jersey. This new collaboration will focus on future research and innovations to improve health outcomes. In May, we announced the next step in our long-standing relationship with Providence Health and Services to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select assets in Oregon. This transaction builds on our more than 20-year history with the Providence family of organizations. Finally, earlier in July, we announced a comprehensive lab relationship with Legacy Health in Portland, Oregon. Under this agreement, Labcorp will acquire select assets of its outreach laboratory business, including laboratory facilities and equipment and manage Legacy's inpatient hospital laboratories. These relationships create immediate value for hospital systems for patients, for communities, while also providing significant growth opportunities for Labcorp. The partnerships meet our criteria of being accretive to earnings and cash in the first year. Although the margins are typically lower than the company average early on, they do improve over time. We are also pleased with our progress integrating hospital partnerships and acquisitions. For example, with Ascension, which we announced in 2022, we continue to see reduced employee turnover and improved performance due to our partnership. This scalable model connects our two mission-driven organizations to provide care teams with information to make the best possible decisions for patients. We continue to look for regional laboratory acquisitions in geographies where we can increase access to diagnostics and expand capabilities. As an example, this week, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Enzo Biochem's Clinical Laboratory division in New Jersey, which serves the New York tristate health care communities. We have a very robust pipeline of potential hospital and local laboratory acquisitions and we'll continue to focus energy and resources on this important opportunity for growth. Additionally, we're investing in innovation and technology that supports diagnostic and drug development testing across disease areas, including cancer, Alzheimer's and other diseases. In May, we commercially launched a new liquid biopsy test, enabling target therapy selection for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The Labcorp Plasma Focus test allows oncologists to better evaluate tumor cells and manage the care of patients through a precision therapy plan. Additionally, our portfolio of kits [ph] solutions from the acquisition of PGDx is gaining momentum with major health systems and academic centers. Our solutions can enable operational and financial efficiencies that are making us a key partner for hospital and health systems as they execute on their precision medicine programs. Recently, we were first laboratory to launch a test for pTau-181 in plasma, an important blood test for potential Alzheimer's patients demonstrating symptoms of dementia. Our teams are at the forefront of Alzheimer's testing as the number of people impacted by this disease is expected to double over the next two decades. In April, we broke ground on the expansion project of our new Central Laboratory facility in Japan. When complete at the end of 2024, the facility will enhance our Central Laboratory testing capabilities to support drug development. We also opened two new facilities in China, a new kit production facility in Suzhou and an immunology and immunotoxicology lab in Shanghai. In addition, we delivered impactful digital solutions to help our customers understand, manage and improve their health. As part of our commitment to improving the customer experience, we launched an advanced e-commerce platform to improve consumer engagement with Labcorp. The platform will support all of our businesses including Labcorp on demand, which offers consumers access to many of Labcorp's innovative tests online nationwide. Lastly, I speak on behalf of the entire management team, when I say that we are excited about our upcoming Investor Day on September 14 in New York City. This event will highlight our go-forward strategy, offer business overviews and provide a longer-term financial outlook. We have a value creation road map that we are excited to share. Today marks a new chapter in our company's history. We have a team of more than 60,000 global employees with united focus. Labcorp's base business is performing very well. We're executing on our growth strategy, and we're leveraging Labcorp's financial strength as well as operational focus to improve health, to improve lives while also increasing shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Good morning, Jack. Yes. So, first of all, I'll answer the second part first. So, we're in good shape for the rest of the year with NHP. We don't expect any additional impact as we go through the second half. And then to answer the first question, if you just look at the midpoint of our guidance, it would imply about a 9.5% increase year-over-year. And that's going to come from both segments, the NHP segment as well as from the Clinical Laboratory \u2013 the Early Development Research Laboratory as well as the Clinical Research Laboratory segments. Good morning, Lisa. Yes. I'll let Glenn answer the first question. I'll take the second one. Lisa, if you look at the reimbursement trends, what I would say is that it continues to be a relatively stable environment. And I feel good about our interactions with the payers, I feel good about our contracts that we have in place. I wouldn't say yet we're there for value-based contracts and so forth. I think there's still a lot of experimentation that happens, but we don't see a lot of significant progress. With all that said, I believe that we're in a very good position moving forward with the payers, and there's nothing that I would expect to be unexpected. What we're watching closely obviously is PAMA to see what happens there and government reimbursement on certain areas. But overall, it remains a pretty healthy environment. Good morning, A.J. Yes. So I'll start with labor, A.J. I mean, obviously labor has been an issue that I think all of health care has been struggling with a bit since COVID. What I would say is if we look at our turnover rates, although they're still higher than they were prior to COVID, they actually look better this year than they did last year, and we're seeing some improvement. Wage inflation continues to be an issue, and we continue to use LaunchPad savings to offset that as best we can. As we look at the $25 million stranded costs that we're going to be removing, it's enterprise-wide. By the end of this year we'll be on the run rate to remove that for next year. But importantly, we're still committed to the $350 million of LaunchPad savings that we've talked about in the past despite the fact that we no longer have the clinical business, where some of that cost savings obviously would have come from. So we are going to continue to look for ways to reduce costs across the enterprise to offset some of the other pressures that we've talked about. Eric, good morning. Yes. There's about $45 million of stranded cost, give or take a couple of million. And we're going to \u2013 we have a path forward, and we've identified the $25 million of that. Yes, Eric. First thing I'd say is as we look at the studies that we have for the back half, we already have the NHPs that we need to support the studies. When we first realized this issue, we immediately began to look for alternative suppliers to ensure that we would have capacity. The reason it took us through the first half of this year is because even when you receive the NHPs, there's an acclimation period before you can utilize them in study. So we've worked through that and based upon what we have today, we feel confident in NHP trials going through the second half of the year, which is why at the midpoint of the guidance, we feel comfortable of 9.5% for the Biopharma Laboratory business. Yes. So what I would say is it is more costly today for NHPs than it was in the past. Much of that cost can be passed on to the customer. With that said, however, the margin on that cost is not able to be passed along. So it does impact margin a bit, but it doesn't impact us negatively. We can pass upon the increased cost. Yes. Thank you, Eric. Yes. Thanks Brian and good morning. We're excited about the success that we've had with the hospital partnerships. I mentioned the three just in this last quarter that we were able to move forward with Jefferson legacy and an additional part of Providence. And the pipeline remains very strong. As I look at the pipeline of potential hospital [indiscernible], I'm excited about the opportunities before us. I think the hospitals are looking for several things. First and foremost, you have to be able to give them patient continuity. They need to make sure that there's no impact to their patients if they do a laboratory agreement. Second thing is science innovation technology; they want to find ways to actually get better science, get better information faster so that they can get better patient care as they move forward. The third thing that they're obviously looking for is to ensure that there is the ability to kind of have a long-term relationship. So I mentioned Providence, a 20-year relationships, these are long-term deals. They take a long time to get up and running and you want to make sure you choose the right partner that's going to be a long-term partner. And as I look forward into the future, this will be a significant area of focus for Labcorp as I think it represents a tremendous growth opportunity. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Kevin. Yes, go ahead, Glenn. Yes. So let me give you some context, and I'll start broad, but then I'll narrow it down to the exact answer your question. Broadly, if you look across Biopharma Laboratories, we feel good about the book of business that we have. We have a book-to-bill of 1.22 trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.22. And it's important to note with the new mix of business that we have, having early development and having our essential laboratories, a book-to-bill 1.1 to 1.2 is healthy. So the book-to-bill is healthy. If we look at our central laboratory business and orders and RFPs, it continues to be very strong and robust. If we look at our early development, we still continue to have a significant number of RFPs about the same as what we've seen before. But in the very emerging and smaller biotechs, we are seeing some pressure particularly as some of them are canceling studies and so forth. Overall, we continue to see very good demand as we walk into next year. When we look at our trailing 12-month book-to-bill, it gives us significant confidence as we go into next year. And the good news is that if you look at the business overall, we are very much skewed towards large pharma, large biotech when you look at the overall laboratory business. Good morning, Derik. Hello John. Yes. Thanks for the question. And you're exactly right, our capital allocation, we focus right now we have a $1 billion accelerated repo program. We've got our dividend that we're committed to. We're going to pay down some maturing debt. And at the same time, we have significant opportunity with hospital laboratories as well as local laboratories as well. And that's the primary focus of what we see in the near-term. I don't see us doing anything that would be a significant deal outside of our core expertise. We're focused on our core and maximizing our core. And as I look at the other parts of our business, I feel like we have a good portion of what we need. There doesn't seem to be anything strategically that we're missing. So it's really going to be about the hospital, local laboratories primarily. Yes. So we are hopeful that there's a path forward on SALSA. ACLA, the trade organization is working on that. But at the same time we realized that we've got to be prepared in case PAMA does get implemented again next year. So when we think about next year, we've built into a plan about $75 million of downside due to PAMA. I'm hoping that we won't realize that, but we have to create our business model, assuming that does occur and have our cost base reflected what we would do if that does happen. I am optimistic that people realize the importance of our industry, the importance of what we do. And therefore, PAMA will not be implemented in the way it has in the past, but that's not what we're planning for as we look forward. Good morning, Patrick. Thanks for the question. Yes. So I'll start, and then Glenn can add some commentary. So we're very pleased with the relationship that we have with Ascension and how the deal is progressing. In particular, the integration is going very, very well. We've given kind of a sense of $550 million to $600 million is what we expect the revenue to be. I would say it's probably contributing more towards the higher end of that than the lower end of that. And if you look at the margins, we said it was going to start up at the low-single-digits and then get to the mid-single digits after the first year, and it's certainly on track to do that. And then we expect next year and the following years for the margin to continue to improve. Ultimately, because of the mix of Ascension being heavily towards managing their laboratories, the margin will never get to our average margin, but it will continue to improve over time. Good morning, Pito. Yes. So if you look at our trend in 12 months, it's 1.23; and that's a very healthy book-to-bill, particularly for the businesses that we have. Early development typically would have a lower book-to-bill because the studies burn much faster and you can actually have studies that start and finish within a given year. So anything between a 1.1 and a 1.2, we consider to be healthy. And as we look forward, we continue to feel that there's plenty of opportunities, the RFPs continue to look good, so we're optimistic about where we're seeing the book to-go. Good morning, Tim. Yes. Thank you, Tim. And the things that we announced today, obviously we had those underway for quite some time to plan and prepare for, so that's irrespective of the clinical business or not. At the end of the day when you think about China, Japan, that's the second and third largest market in the world for pharma. So you need to have a very strong presence to have the capability to meet the needs of the pharmaceutical clients and the biotechnology clients. So it's just our way for us to continue to meet those customer needs. And we've done a lot in the past in terms of ensuring that we have a global presence, and I feel good about the global presence that we have today. We are significantly further ahead, particularly with our central laboratory business than we were before. All right. Thank you, everybody for joining us today. And we really do look forward to sharing more with all of you at our Investor Day in September. So we look forward to that time. We wish you, in the meantime a very happy and healthy summer, and we'll see you in September."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.  With the spin completed on June 30, we have treated Fortrea as discontinued operations in the second quarter. All of my comments will reflect the current business and have been adjusted to exclude Fortrea in prior periods for comparative purposes. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 3.8% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 12.7% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 88% and as we performed an average of 3,000 PCR tests per day in the quarter. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 10.8% and benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 5% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition, while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth. Operating income for the quarter was $266 million or 8.8% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $52 million of amortization and $131 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to the spin of Fortrea acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $448 million or 14.8% of revenue compared to $548 million or 18.7% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mix impact from the Ascension lab management agreement. Excluding these items, margins would have been up slightly as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense and increased R&D investments in oncology. Our LaunchPad initiatives continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the three-year period ending 2024. In addition, the company is implementing actions in the third quarter to take out $25 million of annualized stranded costs throughout the enterprise as a result of the spin. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 25.3% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to R&D tax credits. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter from continuing operations were $155 million or $1.74 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.42 in the quarter, down 15% from last year due to lower COVID testing earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up approximately 18%. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $280 million in the quarter, which was burdened by approximately $65 million of spin-related items. Operating cash flow of $280 million is down from $548 million a year ago, primarily due to lower COVID testing earnings and spin-related items. In addition, higher working capital requirements that are timing related were partially offset by higher base business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $103 million, down from $140 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $177 million, including approximately $65 million of spin-related items. The company invested $137 million in acquisitions and paid out $65 million in dividends. While the company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter, we announced a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to put in place in the third quarter and be completed by year end. At quarter end, we had $1.9 billion in cash, including the $1.6 billion dividend from Fortrea spin, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 2.6 times gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3.8% compared to last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 1.8% and acquisitions of 2.2%. The base business grew organically by 13.5% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 88%. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth. Total volume increased 1.4% compared to last year as acquisition volume grew 2.5%, partially offset by organic volume of minus 1.1% due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 8.1% compared to the base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.7%. The strong year-over-year growth rate was also aided by lower-than-normal volume in the second quarter of 2022 due to Omicron. Price/mix increased 2.4% versus last year, primarily due to organic base business growth of 6.8%, partially offset by lower code testing of 3.9%. Base business organic price/mix was up 8% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics Laboratories adjusted operating income for the quarter was $410 million or 17.5% of revenue compared to $516 million or 22.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing, while the margin decline was also negatively impacted by the mix impact from Ascension. Base business margin, excluding the mix impact of Ascension was up approximately 40 basis points as the benefit of organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense. Now I'll review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $699 million, an increase of 3.1% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in organic revenue of 2.1% and foreign currency of 1.5%. The increase in organic revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 5% due to the previously communicated NHP related supply constraints in our Early Development Research Laboratories business. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $105 million or 15% of revenue compared to $93 million or 13.7% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense. We ended the quarter with backlog of $8 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; in addition, the guidance includes the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program with proceeds from the spin. Excluding Fortrea, our current enterprise guidance for revenue, earnings and cash flow remains unchanged from our prior guidance given in April. Enterprise revenue is in line with Diagnostics Laboratories slightly up while Biopharma Laboratory Services is slightly down. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.5% to 3% compared to 2022. This increase reflects the base business growing 11.3% to 12.6%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 85% to 89%. We expect Diagnostics Laboratories revenue to be up 0.5% to 1.5% compared to 2022. This is a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint from our April guidance as the base business outlook has improved, partially offset by lower COVID testing. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 13.2% to 14.2%, which includes approximately 5% growth from Ascension. The base business has improved from our April guidance based on stronger demand. We continue to expect Diagnostics Laboratories base business margin to be slightly up in 2023 versus 2022 and including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect Biopharma Laboratory Services revenue to grow 3% to 4.5% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 150 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance range is down approximately 75 basis points from the midpoint of our April guidance, but implies around 9.5% growth in the second half of the year as we expect favorable growth in both Central Laboratories and Early Development Research Laboratories. We also expect that the segment margin will be flat to slightly up in 2023 compared to 2022. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS and is $13 to $14, which is consistent with our April guidance, excluding Fortrea and including the impact from the accelerated share repurchase program. Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related items, is expected to be between $800 million to $1 billion, in line with our prior guidance, excluding Fortrea. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we'll now take questions. Yes, hi Jack. So, when we think about margins, again, specifically for Biopharma, obviously, we expect to see a second half margin year improve over the first half and improve year-over-year. So, again, benefiting from the top line growth that Adam said was kind of in the implied revenue growth of 9.5% for the segment, we'll get good leverage over that as well as benefiting from LaunchPad. We said that for the full year for Biopharma, margins will be flat to slightly up, again, consistent with, frankly, Diagnostics margins being up a little bit and for the enterprise as well, including the negative impact from Ascension. So, we feel good about margins driven off of the top line. When you look at the quarter, we felt actually very good with a 15% margin in the quarter for Biopharma, realizing that we had very strong growth coming from Central Lab that really helped it, but also we had negative growth from Early Development Research, which constrained it. So, we feel good about where we are kind of as a run rate. And if we can maintain that level of margin, that will get us, again, higher margins for the full year as well as year-over-year. Yes. And Lisa, on the utilization; so as you think about the quarter, obviously from a base business organic standpoint we were up 13.5%, so obviously very strong growth when you look year-on-year, but including the benefit from Ascension. So think about kind of the same-store sales, if you will, growth, excluding the impact of Ascension we're up around 7%, so higher than normal growth rates in part given the comp that we would have had a year ago. And of that around 5.5% of that is coming from our volume and the other 1.5%, call it from favorable price mix. So as you think about it relative to 2019 kind of pre-pandemic, are we tracking at a more normal level, we would say we are now. If you look at the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019, again that 7% year-on-year growth this year would have been more like around a 4% compound growth rate compared to 2019, with volume in between, call it, 1%, 1.5% growth rate compared to 2019. So as we think about volume normally historically at 1% to 2%, we're kind of sitting squarely in the middle of that. So it says we're tracking more normal, but the year-over-year is benefiting from some softness last year. Yes. A.J., just adding to that and more specifically, the $25 million of annualized cost, stranded costs that will take out this year to your point, while it will be throughout the whole enterprise. Obviously, a lot of it initially will come from the Biopharma segment. So this is the, call it the support that we have at the segment level that's supporting was all three of the businesses that included the Fortrea business now supporting the two. So we'll look to take out a lot of those stranded costs. In addition, we'll take out some stranded costs that's in corporate unallocated that wouldn't have been allocated to any of the businesses. Having said that, when you look at our corporate unallocated number we did around $66 million in the quarter, we have been seeing an increase in that relative to the R&D investments we're making in oncology. So very targeted investments that will kind of be offset that growth by some of the costs coming out of corporate and allocated due to stranded. So as we think about the run rate of corporate unallocated, that $66 million should still hold true, so it's roughly around 2.2% of our revenues. So as we think longer term, in addition to the $25 million that we're taking out, which is more of a short-term cost to take out of the stranded, we feel there's also some other opportunities to take out additional costs within the corporate unallocated as we go forward and then obviously look to see the company through organic growth as well as acquisition growth. As we grow as a company, we'll be able to leverage the infrastructure and the cost structure we have there even more. Yes. So, hi, Kevin. So you're right. So as we went back and obviously looked at the current outlook, we said that overall at the enterprise level consistent at the midpoint with revenues, earnings, cash flow and we obviously talked a bit about some pluses and minuses within the businesses that made up that at the enterprise level, where we were excluding Fortrea, when you work down to the earnings similar. So we had the earnings that we would have had in our outlook. We backed out the earnings in April, if you will, taking out Fortrea, but obviously we had the cash from the spin that we added back in there. And so from an earnings and then similar cash flow at the $900 million free cash flow from continuing ops, again, excluding spend, excluding Fortrea; so all of those would have been in line with the expectations that we had in April. When you look at acquisitions to Enzo in particular. So Enzo, we talked about that free cash flow in our guidance, the free cash flow we generated in the year is between M&A, share repurchases and dividends. So there's a portion of that capital, that's an M&A that we include in the enterprise revenues and that we don't include it in the segment revenues until those transactions are actually completed and then we move them down, wouldn't change the enterprise number, but it will affect if you will kind of a segment. Similarly, with lower COVID than what we were expecting in April, that's being absorbed by stronger base business demand in diagnostics. So favorable diagnostics on the upside, a little softness within the biopharma services and a little softness in COVID, but netting out to the enterprise. So that's how we kind of come back to the consistency, if you will, if they're in lines with the pluses and minuses. And LaunchPad again we talked about is continuing on track. So when we think about the labor markets, really no change in our viewpoint from labor. I mean, frankly, our attrition rates are tracking better than they have been a year ago, even though it's still higher than what we would have seen pre-pandemic. The cost \u2013 the inflationary costs really haven't changed much from where we were thinking they would be in April. So that's, frankly, we would say kind of in line with where we would have thought. So overall, we feel, again, good about what we thought our businesses were going to do this year continues to be that same pace. Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is that when you think about, again what's changed in our outlook a little bit, part of that is the benefit of Ascension. As Adam said, we're clearly towards the upper or at the upper end of the expectations we had, so improved on the volume side. And then in addition from a margin standpoint, while we're initially expecting, call it that low-to-mid-single digits we're tracking well there as we get that additional volume coming through with momentum taking us into the rest of the year. Hi, Tim. What you'll see is that consistent with what we've done before. So the same metrics that we provided for the two segments will continue. Obviously, Biopharma Laboratory Services now consists of the two versus the three businesses. But you'll see in the enhanced disclosures that we provided, we continue to do a breakout of the individual businesses. And that from the segment standpoint we give guidance for their top line for the year. We provide, obviously in our remarks the trailing 12 months, which is really where we focus on book-to-bill and backlog and orders. But in the enhanced disclosures, we also provide that on a quarterly basis, so none of the changes from where we've been providing before."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Chas Cook. Sir, you may begin.\nChas Cook: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp\u2019s first quarter 2023 conference call. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today\u2019s call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the proposed spinoff of the clinical development business, the impact of various factors on the company\u2019s businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based on a use factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It is great to be with you today to discuss the start of 2023 and the progress that we\u2019re making. Our first quarter results set the foundation for a strong 2023. Performance this quarter was driven by very strong momentum across our diagnostic business, continued industry leadership in central laboratories, solid fundamentals and staffing improvements and early development and a mixed quarter for clinical development. For drug development, we expected the first half of 2023 to be more challenging than the second as the first half continues to be impacted by NHP shortages, the previously noted loss of an FSP contract and lower COVID-related work. We are on track to complete the spin of our clinical development business midyear, and we anticipate the business to accelerate in the second half of 2023, once Fortrea is officially launched. Customers have been positive about the transaction and our progress with some short-term customer delays as well as a slightly slower backlog burn rate compared to previous years. Sometimes they are waiting until after the transaction is complete to award new business, but our dialogue remains encouraging as we approach the close as evidenced by a renewal of an FSP contract with a large pharma customer this quarter. In the first quarter, revenue totaled $3.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $3.82 and free cash flow was $27 million. Overall, our base business is performing well. Excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise-based business revenue grew 10% in the first quarter versus the same period of prior year. Since 2019, prior to COVID, both diagnostics and drug development based businesses have grown revenue at approximately 7% CAGR. The Diagnostics Base Business revenue grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter. This strong top line performance continues to be driven by both routine and esoteric testing as well as a benefit from hospital deals, including our Ascension partnership. For Drug Development, first quarter revenue declined 4% versus prior year. Drug Development ended the quarter with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.27. Enterprise Base Business margins were lower than prior year. However, we still anticipate slight margin expansion for 2023. As we continue the Ascension integration, we overcome NHP supply issues, and we realized benefits from the LaunchPad initiative. We are continuing to implement cost controls across both businesses to offset inflationary pressures. Finally, COVID PCR testing volumes declined during the quarter, more than expected, totaling more than 870,000 tests performed and averaging 10,000 tests per day. We expect COVID testing to continue to decline. Glenn will provide additional detail on our quarterly results as well as our 2023 outlook in just a moment. Moving now to an update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development Business, we are on track to complete the spin midyear, subject to the regulatory approval process. We have confidence in the foundation that has been established despite short-term pressures. Fortrea will benefit from the leadership of Tom Pike as CEO. We plan to announce the leadership team and the Fortrea Board of Directors in the near future. We encourage you to visit fortrea.com to learn more. Upon completion, we\u2019ll create two strong independent companies through a tax-fee transaction. Both Labcorp and Fortrea will emerge from a transaction with their ability to better meet customer needs, to drive sustainable and profitable growth, and to deliver attractive shareholder returns. I\u2019ll now move to our enterprise strategy. We are laying the groundwork for the future by executing against our strategic initiatives. We continue to integrate Ascension assets and operations in the first quarter. Labcorp is now managing laboratories in nearly 100 Ascension hospitals. Ascension health system laboratories and other deals including our previously announced strategic relationship with RWJ Barnabus Health are strong proof points of our ability to generate growth through future healthcare system partnerships. Health systems are adapting to financial pressures, inflation, labor shortages, and other challenges, and they\u2019re seeking the right laboratory partner amidst these headwinds. We are working with our health system partners to develop tailored, innovative and cost effective solutions that meet the unique needs of their patients and providers. Last month, we entered into agreement with Enzo Biochem to acquire the assets of its clinical laboratory division. Today, we are in active discussions to expand relationships and execute new engagements with other partners. The pipeline for hospital and local lab acquisition and investment is robust. And we look forward to updating you on existing in new partnerships throughout the year. Turning to oncology, we partnered with ImmunoGen on an Immunohistochemistry sponsored testing program to increase access for patients with ovarian cancer. Additionally, Labcorp added HER2 low reporting to the IHC test for breast cancer. This test is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic of HER2 low status for patients with metastatic breast cancer, impacting patient eligibility for treatments and therapies that can improve outcomes. Labcorp also entered into a strategic collaboration with VieCure to provide clinicians greater access to precision oncology decision support. This collaboration builds on our capabilities to improve access to high quality care for cancer patients and their community cancer care providers. We continue to expand our digital health platform Labcorp OnDemand. We launched three new tests in the first quarter, including a PSA prostate cancer screening test, a hepatitis B immunity test, and a fatigue test for people with chronic fatigue systems including post-COVID fatigue. Before I wrap up, we are looking forward to two upcoming events though provide investors more color on our near to mid-term future. We have Fortrea Investor Day tentatively scheduled for June 6 in which we\u2019ll discuss the exciting opportunities ahead. We expect the Form 10 to be available in advance of the meeting. Additionally, we are planning a Labcorp Investor Day, which is tentatively scheduled for September. Labcorp is strong today and will emerge from the completion of the upcoming spin even stronger. Our diagnostics laboratory, early development research laboratory and central laboratory businesses are market leaders with solid fundamentals. We\u2019re executing against our long-term strategy that will position these businesses for continued growth in the future. I want to take a moment to thank our team for their continued contributions to Labcorp and our customers. The team is generating strong base business performance while preparing for transformational transaction mid-year. At more than 80,000 strong, our team works every day to find new ways to harness science, innovation, and technology for the betterment of our stakeholders. Labcorp is well-positioned to progress our mission to improve health and improve lives while generating attractive returns for shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I\u2019m going to start my comments with a review of first quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we have also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency. This was partially offset by organic based business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 84% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew 9.8% compared to the base business last year. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 9.2%, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth. Operating income for the quarter was $341 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $69 million of amortization and $83 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related acquisitions, LaunchPad initiatives, and the proposed spin of Fortrea. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $494 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $794 million or 20.4% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing demand. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mixed impact from the Ascension TSA and NHP related constraints. Excluding these items, margins would\u2019ve been up slightly as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially upset by higher personnel expense, inflationary costs, and increased R&D investments in oncology. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the three year period ending 2024. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 23.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from increased R&D tax credits. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $213 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.82 in the quarter, down 37% from last year due to lower COVID testing earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up 10%. Operating cash flow was $121 million in the quarter compared to $356 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower COVID testing earnings and spin related costs, partially offset by higher base business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $94 million down from $117 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was $27 million and the company paid out $64 million in dividends. The first quarter is generally the company\u2019s softest quarter for free cash flow. We continue to expect our full year free cash flow to be between $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Now review our segment performance beginning with diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, driven by organic revenue being down 4.7%, which was due to COVID testing, partially offset by acquisitions of 2%. COVID testing revenue was down 84% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew organically by 17.5% compared to the base business last year. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth, while the impact of weather and revenue days benefited growth by approximately 2%. Total volume decreased 3.3% compared to last year, as organic volume decreased by 5.6%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 2.3%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 11% compared to base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.6% and favorable weather and revenue days of approximately 2%. The strong year-over-year growth rate was also impacted by lower than normal volume in the first quarter of 2022, due to Omicron. Price mix increased 0.4% versus last year as the base business improved 6.6% and was partially offset by lower COVID testing of 5.7%, currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Base business price mix was up 8.8% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $442 million or 18.5% of revenue compared to $683 million or 27.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing, which carried a margin of approximately 50% for the quarter. Going forward, we expect a lower margin for COVID testing, but still above the segment average. Base business margin was up approximately 80 basis points driven by organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense and the mix impact from the Ascension TSA. Now review the performance of drug development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to last year, primarily due to decreased organic revenue of 2.4% and foreign currency of 1.5%. The decrease in adjusted organic revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 8% due to NHP related constraints, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work, and the previously mentioned FSP contract loss. The early development business was the most constrained by these items. Excluding these impacts, organic base business revenue for the segment grew approximately 6% with early development up 17%, central lab up 6% and clinical development up 3%. Reported first quarter drug development revenues on a compounded annual basis grew 6.9% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $124 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to $169 million or 11.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to NHP-related constraints, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work and the FSP contract loss, which negatively impacted margins by approximately 350 basis points. Excluding these items, margins would have increased primarily due to demand and LaunchPad savings being partially offset by higher personnel expense, inflationary costs and a write-off of receivables related to small biotech customers. We ended the quarter with backlog of $16.6 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I\u2019ll discuss our updated 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2023 for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Also, our guidance assumes that Fortrea will be part of Labcorp for the full year. Following its spin currently anticipated in the middle of the year, we expect to provide updated guidance. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.5% to 4% compared to 2022. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 25 basis points. This increase reflects the base business range increasing to 9.5% to 11%, while COVID testing guidance range has been lowered to minus 80% to 90%. We continue to perform well in diagnostics and are taking up our full year guidance range. We expect diagnostics revenue to be down 0.5% to up 2% compared to 2022, this is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 100 basis points, primarily due to stronger base business volume. This guidance includes the expectation that the Base Business will now grow 12.5% to 14%, which has approximately 5% growth due to Ascension. We expect Diagnostics Base Business margin to be up in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect drug development revenue to grow 3.5% to 5.5% compared to 2022. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 150 basis points due to slower-than-expected backlog conversion, primarily due to investigator site constraints and lower-than-expected first quarter orders. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 60 basis points. At the midpoint of our guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 6.8%, primarily due to organic growth. We also continue to expect that the drug development margin will increase slightly in 2023 compared to 2022. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16.25 to $17.75. This is a tightening of the range from our prior guidance, while the midpoint is unchanged. This guidance reflects lower earnings from COVID testing; while Base Business adjusted EPS is expected to increase 15% at the midpoint. Free cash flow guidance is $1 billion to $1.2 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to continue to decline through the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through a share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Group. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi. Good morning.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: Good morning. Can you just provide some more color on the NHP issue? I think you said in your prepared remarks, you think it would get better in the second half or maybe the CRO in general improvement in the second half. Maybe what gives you that confidence? And when do you think we get some type of resolve with this NHP issue? And if it doesn\u2019t resolve by year-end, when do you think it could impact maybe late-stage business? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you, Ann, and good morning. So I\u2019ll give you some additional context on NHPs and where we stand. If you look at the first quarter, the NHP impact of early development was approximately $50 million to $60 million. But it\u2019s important to note that, that does not leverage well because we\u2019re continuing to hire people, and we\u2019re continuing to keep people because we now have enough supply that we feel confident in the second half of the year, and we feel confident as we go into next year. If you look at the underlying demand of the early development business, excluding that impact, it looks good. It actually grew 15% to 17%. So we feel good about the second half of the year for that reason. We said that the first quarter would have the highest impact of NHPs and there\u2019ll still be some impact in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we expect the impact to be between $30 million to $40 million. The reason why is, as we get supply in, it still takes time to acclimate and to train and to be ready for the new study starts. So we feel good about our supply situation. We feel good about the second half of the year. We feel good about going into next year. The first quarter was certainly the biggest impact of $50 million to $60 million. Second quarter would be less of an impact of $30 million to $40 million. But most importantly, the underlying early development business would have grown 15% to 17% had it not been for the NHPs.\nAnn Hynes: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Good morning. So my questions are going to be focused on the diagnostics business. The first one is, if I look at base sales in the first quarter, sequentially they were up 7% which is really strong versus what we\u2019ve seen historically. So I heard calendar days and weather were favorable, I\u2019m guessing the Medicare drop view was probably helpful there, too. Is there anything else you would call out to explain sort of the sequential pickup?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So Jack, first of all, I\u2019d say we\u2019re very pleased with the performance in diagnostics, every which way you look at it whether you look at esoteric, routine, look at our hospital, ex-hospital, if you look at our mix, we\u2019re looking very, very strong in the diagnostic business, and that enabled us to up the guidance range for that base business. If you look at volumes, specifically, the base business last year compared to this year, we\u2019re up 11% this year versus last year. About 2.5% of that was acquisitions, and then it was favorable weather and revenue days that was about 2%, but also remember comparing to last year where Omicron was impacting our business. So when you look, it\u2019s still very, very strong but it\u2019s a little bit more typical to what you would expect. As we look at the sequential difference, I feel really good about where we are with Ascension and things that are happening with not just the TSA, but also the acquisition part of Ascension in the business that we bought. But I\u2019ll see if Glenn wants to add some additional color.\nGlenn Eisenberg: No. I think that hits it in. I think anytime you look especially in the diagnostics business, we\u2019ve talked about the seasonality of the business. So looking at sequential, you do have to factor in those issues of days, if you will, obviously the impact of acquisitions that are annualizing as well as the \u2013 I guess, the fundamental issue that Adam spoke to is just we continue to see strong demand as we go forward. And the year-over-year comps look good and sequentially, similarly we expect the growth to continue throughout the year.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then on the margin front in the Diagnostics segment, can you share like what was the Ascension business margin in the first quarter? How is that trending? And can you quantify how big the TSA is?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I\u2019ll give some context and Glenn, if you could jump in as well. But we always said that the beginning when we first were doing the integration, the margin will be at the lowest point, which will be in the low-single digits. We\u2019re actually saying getting closer to the mid-single digits now, although not quite there. Over time, the margin will continue to improve. It will never reach the average margin of our current business. But we have already started to see some margin improvement, and we expect that that\u2019s going to continue as we go through this year into next year.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Just, and it speaks a little to the early \u2013 the earlier question two [ph] on the sequential. We continue to see revenues within Ascension continue to grow. So it grew sequentially. We\u2019re still, as you\u2019ll recall when we announced the transaction, expected around $550 million to $600 million in revenue based upon our current guidance, our revenue would be at the upper end or maybe even slightly above it. It\u2019s going to contribute around 5% of our growth this year, and as you know, it will annualize after the third quarter. So the fourth quarter comp will have it in both periods. So we\u2019re seeing good growth. Obviously, it impacted our revenue in the first quarter, call it around 7.5% year-on-year. So the revenues are coming in nicely. And as Adam said, while we talked about mid-to \u2013 we\u2019re low-to-mid-single digit margins, we\u2019re kind of at the upper end of that range right now with the expectation that margin growth or improvement will continue as we go forward through the year, but especially beyond that.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Caliendo: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to understand the margin progression on the CRO business. I understand sort of what you\u2019re guiding for year-over-year margin expansion a little bit. How do we get there? What\u2019s the cadence of that? Like what drives that? Can you just talk through sort of the execution of how we get the year-over-year margin expansion in that segment of the business?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, glad to. And I\u2019ll first start off by saying that if you look at early development, as I said before, excluding the NHP constraints, the underlying business is strong. Same thing, I mean, if you look at our central laboratory business that looks very strong. And especially when you look at it in the CAGR, you can see strength in that business as well. It was a mixed quarter for the clinical development business, which I can talk about. But there are three things that impacted our margin significantly in the quarter that we think as we go through the year; at least two of them will start to look much better. The first one is NHP revenue. I already stated that was a $50 million to $60 million impact in first quarter. We expect it to be $30 million to $40 million in second quarter. That loss falls to the bottom line. It doesn\u2019t leverage well because we\u2019re continuing to hire people, and we\u2019re continuing to run that business like we didn\u2019t have the constraints. It\u2019s been hard to find people. It takes time to train people. It was one of the issues we faced last year. So we purposely decided to manage that business differently. Even though the revenue was down for the NHP constraints, we continue to hire people, and we continue to run the margins at a very low rate for that reason. The second thing is there was a write-down of bad debt for a small biotech company. It was one small company that actually went bankrupt and we had a write-off was about $10 million to $12 million. And then the third thing is we are seeing a bit of a lower burn rate in clinical. It\u2019s not surprising overly because we\u2019ve seen kits coming back, not where they were prior to 2019. We think that\u2019s now flowing through a bit to the clinical business. But those three things we expect will get better the first two, certainly. The third one we think will continue to improve as we go through the year.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. I\u2019d say the other thing, too, Kevin, if you look at the first quarter, and again, it goes back a little bit to the seasonality question; first quarter margins for drug development are historically the lowest. And if you looked at what we did last year, we did around 11.6% in margin. But for the full year, we delivered 14% margins. When you look at this year, obviously, we have a low first quarter margin. But our expectation is that it will be slightly above next year, in part, the constraints that I have said, but the top line growth that we expect in the business that\u2019s implied in our revenue guidance would get you roughly around 7.5% for the remaining nine months. So, top line growth, LaunchPad savings, not having the constraints will drive the margin improvement.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Can I ask a quick follow-up just on the clinical backlog? How has that changed by segment maybe year-over-year or the like? I\u2019m not trying to ask for any forward look on the Form 10 and what the backlogs are going to look between the two businesses. But maybe if you can describe how the backlog has changed in terms of customer or type or even duration? Any color on that year-over-year or even sequentially, would be really helpful.\nAdam Schechter: Yes, I would say, in general, if you look at early development, we do much more of our backlog in small to medium biotech business, less as a percent in pharma. If you look at our clinical business, we do more in pharma, less in small biotech than we do in our fully development business. And then if you look at our Central Laboratory, it\u2019s pretty evenly split, but it\u2019s much more \u2013 I mean it\u2019s in between the two, but it\u2019s more towards large pharma than it is to small, medium-sized biotech. So I would say large pharma, middle-sized pharma is the majority of our book-to-bill in the clinical business as well as the central lab business. And it\u2019s much more skewed to small to medium-sized biotech in the early development business. And overall, the book-to-bill was 1.27 for the trailing 12 months.\nKevin Caliendo: When I say the mix, that hasn\u2019t changed at all like that backlog or the book-to-bill between the clinical stage and the early stage, has that migrated in any way over the last 12 months, meaning is there more in clinical now less in early stage or vice versa?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, we don\u2019t really break it out that way. Obviously, as we get closer to spin, we will be breaking out differently than we do today. But at this time, we really haven\u2019t broken it out by the different business segments.\nKevin Caliendo: I appreciate that, thanks guys.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning. Good morning guys. Maybe just to follow-up on Kevin\u2019s question from earlier, as I think of your comment, Glenn, in the prepared remarks about book-to-bill conversion being a little slower than you expected, maybe what gives you the confidence and the visibility to the improvement as we think about the back half of the year on book-to-bill? Thanks.\nGlenn Eisenberg: So no, we have seen the trend go down. If you look at the fourth quarter, we were rounding around 30% backlog conversion where this quarter, we\u2019re kind of at the 29.5%. So, we have seen kind of the trend down. We\u2019d assume that this level going forward. So, when you look at the call down in our revenue outlook for the year, that effectively was half of the reason for the decline with the other being a little bit of softer orders that we had in the first quarter that, as you know, we still need roughly around 20% of current year revenues to come from new orders as we did see a little bit of a softness there. But overall, we\u2019re looking at the backlog, we\u2019re looking at the contracts that we have, the burn rate that we currently see from those contracts, and we feel comfortable with the current expectation. Frankly, there\u2019s always a range that you can say that we can see it pick up a bit. There were a couple of large contracts in particular that caused the conversion to come a little bit lower. So once those burn through a little bit or the mix improves, hopefully, we\u2019ll see a little bit of a pickup. But for right now, that kind of 29.5-ish kind of percent conversion is what we\u2019re assuming.\nBrian Tanquilut: Awesome, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey good morning. Thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe one on the Diagnostics business, just on the price mix that continues to be a pretty nice story for you guys. Can you just give a bit more color there in terms of how we should expect that to trend the remainder of the year? Any change to the tone with payers? I know things have improved a bit there, but would love to kind of give a bit more color in terms of payer conversations? Any change there? And again, what we should be thinking for the rest of the year on that front?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, hi Patrick, I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019ll ask Glenn to give some specifics. But in terms of payers, we have very good conversations with the payers, very constructive. I feel good about our access and the continued access that we will have. You continue to see price pressure in every single part of health care. But at the same time, we\u2019re not seeing any significant changes to the trends of what\u2019s happened in the past. So I feel good about price and price mix as we go through this year to next year. Maybe you can give some specifics, Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Sure, Patrick. When you look at the \u2013 we talked about the 7.5% kind of growth this year organically in diagnostics. The price mix benefit from that was a little over 9%, 9.2%. We commented that extension the TSA we treat as all price. So that was 7.5%, if you will. So we did around, call it 1.7% in price mix, which is not too dissimilar when you back out the ascension to where we\u2019ve done \u2013 where we\u2019ve been. We continue to track well. When you look at even our guidance for the full year, which will help kind of convey what we continue to expect, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we have around 13.25% growth. We\u2019re picking up around close to 5% from Ascension as well as probably around 1.5 points from M&A. So overall, call it, that midpoint, excluding Ascension and acquisitions, we\u2019d be up around 7%. So we\u2019re tracking similarly. We expect roughly around 6% of it from volume, 1% of it from price, again, now that it doesn\u2019t include the Ascension. So historically, we would have said organic revenue or volume of, call it, around 2%. You pick up a point from a price mix of 3%. So where we see price right now continues to be pretty consistent with that. And as Adam said, the payer mix has helped. We continue to see a positive trend in our tests per Ascension. We continue to see a positive trend with our esoteric growing faster than routine. We also picked up a little bit on the draw fee, but we continue to do headwinds from unit pricing. So the fact that we continue to see price mixed favorable is really the mix impact of our business more than offsetting any pricing headwinds.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a quick one just on the drug discovery side. You mentioned to write down one biotech contract. Can you just talk about any change in tone from those early biotech customers as the quarter progressed? Obviously had a little bit of the banking fallout mid quarter. Just wondering if you sensed the change in tone, a change in appetite for spend from that customer base as the quarter progressed? Thank you, guys.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. What I would say there is overall, they represent a smaller part of our business, obviously than the mid to large size pharma and biotech. Some small companies are struggling a bit right now with cash, and you hear that a little bit, but it hasn\u2019t really impacted the flow of our RFPs or the dollar amount of our RFPs at the moment. But that\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching very closely. And obviously in the market environment that we\u2019re in, it\u2019s harder for these very small startup companies which represent a pretty small amount of our business frankly.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing, I\u2019d add too is which to your point, so the large or the small but biotech customer that went bankrupt was around $5 million of the $12 million that we put in place. So we built up reserves just given the current environment to make sure that if were there any other issues that we would have that we feel that were adequately reserved for. But as Adam said, small part of the business we\u2019re just being hopefully prudent in establishing the reserve for the potential that some other smaller players could have some issues.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.\nAdam Schechter: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Derek DeBruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Derek.\nDerek DeBruin: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, just want to follow-up on Patrick\u2019s question there. You talked about 6% volume, 1% price this year, historically 2%, 1%. How do we think about that in going forward? Does it revert back to historical levels? Is the 6% volume \u2013 is that a high \u2013 is that just off of the easier comps? Just sort of like some color on how to think about it going forward?\nAdam Schechter: So Derek, I guess in February this year, we kind of gave our longer-term outlook of what we felt for diagnostics that we\u2019d see kind of 2.5% to 4.5%. So little bit better than what we\u2019ve done historically, again in that 3%-ish range. So to your point, the fact that we had such a strong quarter. In the first quarter to some extent, we had a soft quarter of a year ago because of Omicron. So we would expect volumes to be higher. But frankly, one of the reasons we talked about what our full year guidance is that we\u2019re tracking really well, we continue to see that favorable kind of 6%-ish number throughout this year as a base volume. But I think at this stage, when you look at the call it the CAGR to 2019 let\u2019s say how are we tracking we\u2019re doing around a 7% CAGR in diagnostics revenue compared to 2019 that\u2019s at the call the midpoint of our guidance. Ascension this year is going to benefit us around a couple of points, and we always have around a point for acquisition. So from a revenue standpoint, this year compared to pre-pandemic, we\u2019re growing it around 4%. So again, call it the middle to upper end of our targeted range. So again, part of the issues on a year-on-year comparison is that last year in diagnostics, given all the issues with COVID was softer than we expect. So now as we\u2019re coming through the recovery, we would expect the stronger growth rate, which is what we\u2019re experiencing.\nGlenn Eisenberg: And the only thing I would add to that is, with the health systems that we\u2019re winning and the pipeline that we have, I do believe that there\u2019s spillover that occurs in the surrounding geographies when you win those health systems. It\u2019s very hard to quantify. But I believe that it helps with our underlying demand.\nDerek DeBruin: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And just this one quick follow-up. Have you seen any business shifts in the NHP \u2013 given that you\u2019ve got some NHP supply from the back half of the year and your main competitors still sort of a question mark, have you seen any sort of like contracts moving over any business moving over?\nAdam Schechter: At this point, we have not, but we\u2019re in a lot of discussions.\nDerek DeBruin: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Tim.\nTim Daley: Hey, thank you. Just quickly on their class question there, the supply NHP potential share gains. Are you guys seeing any customers pushing back? I know that supply was prob \u2013 I think it was domestically bread and probably at elevated levels. Is pricing still an issue or is we in the situ \u2013 are we in the situation where supply being available is overcoming any price headwinds for price concerns on the customer angle?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. I mean, the customers want to get their studies done and they understand the pricing issues that we\u2019re all facing. So they continue to fill the pipeline with studies that they want to complete, even though there are pricing issues that we\u2019re all facing.\nTim Daley: All right. No, appreciate that. And then just the obligatory SALSA question here. With the noise in Washington, not really looking to calm down anytime soon. How can you give us an update of PAMA, SALSA progress there? That\u2019d be great.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I was very happy about the one year of PAMA reprieve. I wish we would\u2019ve had legislation passed at the end of last year. SALSA certainly has bipartisan support and I\u2019m glad it continues to have bipartisan support. So anybody I talk to, anybody that you give them the understanding of SALSA, I haven\u2019t read into anybody that doesn\u2019t understand the issues and isn\u2019t supportive. So I feel like we still have a good chance to get SALSA approved. I know our trade group, ACLA is working very hard to make sure that we continue to have our voice heard. And although, I continue to put in our base case that PAMA will impact us next year. I continue to be cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll find a way to get some type of legislation approved as we go through this year. But I agree with you. It\u2019s not easy in the current environment.\nTim Daley: All right. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you, and good morning. I want to hit first on the bio \u2013 small biotech bad debt right down. I have to say, however, many decades of watching this space. It\u2019s pretty rare to see a small client get talked about as a $10 million plus write-down. I\u2019m just curious how did the receivables expand to that level in this case? And what kind of an outlook is there for other clients that might be similarly exposed?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. This is I think we commented on \u2013 I believe on the last question or two, the $12 million that we took was both a write-down of a receivable from a customer that went bankrupt as well as a buildup of reserves. So the $5 million exposure we did have to a small biotech customer that obviously had gone on for a while before they obviously went bankrupt. And so that was the write-off. The other $7 million again, which is unusual to your point, we normally don\u2019t speak about bad debt with regard to our drug development business, but in the current environment, we felt it was appropriate to build up an additional reserve just given what\u2019s going on rather than just do it once and then if something occurs later, we do it again. So we feel we\u2019re adequately reserved in the current environment, but again, which is unusual, but that\u2019s the \u2013 extent is the $12 million is a total and the $5 million is unique to that one customer.\nAdam Schechter: And Eric, I don\u2019t think this is a new trend\u2026\nEric Coldwell: Thanks. Yes.\nAdam Schechter: Eric, I don\u2019t think this is a new trend or something that I think this was a very specific thing that happened here.\nEric Coldwell: I\u2019m sorry, I missed the follow-up on that. I was \u2013 I\u2019m juggling a couple of calls here.\nAdam Schechter: No problem.\nEric Coldwell: So the \u2013 I had a couple of quick follow ups, hopefully. First on COVID PCR, you mentioned the adjusted margin around 50% in Q1 I believe, and again signaled it would be lower the rest of the year. Can you give us a sense on directionally where you\u2019re thinking this COVID margin plays out in LCD? And is there any phasing we should be aware of 2Q may be better than 3Q given make quarter timing on PHE, et cetera. I\u2019m just curious if you could give us a bigger ballpark of what you think a sustainable COVID operating margin might be particularly in the back half of the year when everything\u2019s perhaps more normal on the reimbursement front.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So overall, we talked about the CMS reimbursement at around a $100 and obviously our average is probably in the low to mid-80s overall. But we\u2019ve talked about that post public health emergency that we expect that the CMS reimbursement rate will call it drop in half. So ultimately, that\u2019s where we\u2019re coming down on pricing. And then the volumes we spoke to, we did around 10,000 PCR tests per day in the quarter. Really, we\u2019re currently at a rate that\u2019s closer to 5,000 and that\u2019s really our expectation going forward. So you\u2019re looking at relatively low volumes at kind of half of the pricing. So it\u2019s going to come off of the 50% that\u2019s benefiting from full pricing and stronger volume. But we do believe that the overall margin, if you look at the base businesses in the high teens, you should \u2013 we currently expect that to call it the COVID margins will at least start with the two. So it\u2019ll be greater than the margins that we have for the overall segment, but again, at lower volumes.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then last one for me, I know there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been hit on a few times, but could you be more specific on clinical development net book-to-bill in Q1? Just \u2013 was it above one? Was it significantly below the overall average? Just trying to get a sense on what kind of a hole it might be digging out of if you progressed towards the spend.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So when we provided the book-to-bill, yes, we normally focus on the trailing 12, which as Adam said was a 1.27. We do in our supplemental information provide the quarterly, which was at a 1.18. So overall, the orders or the book-to-bill continues to be what we feel healthy overall, again, focusing more on the trailing 12. We did comment on the \u2013 in Adam\u2019s remarks that we did have the benefit of an FSP renewal contract in the \u2013 of the quarter. So, which again, periodically comes up. But overall, the backlog looks good, the conversion\u2019s a little bit lower, but we also spoke to that in the first quarter, we saw orders come in softer than what we expected. And to your point, it\u2019s really all driven on our clinical business, which again, in part is the issue with spending all this time on the spin. Adam commented that some of the customers are waiting before giving us orders until after the spin is up and running independent and very focused going forward. But the overall, book-to-bill, we always try to shoot for a 1.2 to be able to support mid to high single digit growth rates. And currently, even for the quarter, we\u2019re at a 1.18, but again, benefiting with a renewal of an FSP.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. The only thing I would add, Eric, is that the customers I\u2019ve spoken to are pleased with the work we\u2019re doing. They\u2019re actually excited about the increased focus that will occur after the spin. It\u2019s temporary. They\u2019re just saying, you\u2019ve said the spin is mid-year, get that done and then come back. So I think there\u2019s this short-term issue that we\u2019re facing. I don\u2019t get any sense that there\u2019s anything other than a short-term issue. In fact, the customers are excited about overall the spin.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Erin.\nErin Wright: Great. Good morning. On the M&A pipeline in core diagnostics, how is that shaping up relative to maybe what you were seeing a year ago or how would you characterize the M&A pipeline now?\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Erin, for the question. I mean, the pipeline is robust. I would say, it\u2019s better today than it was a year ago. I mean, there\u2019s not too many deals the size of Ascension. But when you look at the number of deals and the number of health systems that we\u2019re talking to, I\u2019m very pleased with where we are. We\u2019ll have more to announce as we move forward this year, so stay tuned. But it\u2019s a very robust pipeline of health systems and local laboratories that we\u2019re looking at.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. And a quick one on the CRO side, can you describe a little bit more of the nature of the \u2013 I think you mentioned a new business win in large pharma on the CRO side of the business. Was this FSP contract or was this something else or anything that you can describe on that front in terms of the nature of that new business win? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. It was a renewal of a large pharma FSP. And the reason I think it\u2019s important is because as we\u2019re going through the spin, I mentioned that some customers are excited about the spin, but they\u2019ve said, let\u2019s wait until after the spin, we\u2019ll talk about more business. This large pharma company said, no, we\u2019re so pleased with the work that you\u2019ve done that we want to renew that FSP now. So it just gives you a sense that we are continuing to have good momentum as we go into the spin and through the spin, despite some short-term pressures there.\nErin Wright: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. I will now like to turn the call back over to Adam for closing remarks.\nAdam Schechter: Well, thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re continuing to drive performance across our businesses, while we\u2019re making great progress towards completing the planned mid-year spin of clinical development. We look forward to updating you further at our upcoming Fortrea Investor Day in June. And I can\u2019t wait to provide you with additional information about Labcorp and the bright future, I believe we have in September. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It is great to be with you today to discuss the start of 2023 and the progress that we're making. Our first quarter results set the foundation for a strong 2023. Performance this quarter was driven by very strong momentum across our diagnostic business, continued industry leadership in central laboratories, solid fundamentals and staffing improvements and early development and a mixed quarter for clinical development. For drug development, we expected the first half of 2023 to be more challenging than the second as the first half continues to be impacted by NHP shortages, the previously noted loss of an FSP contract and lower COVID-related work. We are on track to complete the spin of our clinical development business midyear, and we anticipate the business to accelerate in the second half of 2023, once Fortrea is officially launched. Customers have been positive about the transaction and our progress with some short-term customer delays as well as a slightly slower backlog burn rate compared to previous years. Sometimes they are waiting until after the transaction is complete to award new business, but our dialogue remains encouraging as we approach the close as evidenced by a renewal of an FSP contract with a large pharma customer this quarter. In the first quarter, revenue totaled $3.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $3.82 and free cash flow was $27 million. Overall, our base business is performing well. Excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise-based business revenue grew 10% in the first quarter versus the same period of prior year. Since 2019, prior to COVID, both diagnostics and drug development based businesses have grown revenue at approximately 7% CAGR. The Diagnostics Base Business revenue grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter. This strong top line performance continues to be driven by both routine and esoteric testing as well as a benefit from hospital deals, including our Ascension partnership. For Drug Development, first quarter revenue declined 4% versus prior year. Drug Development ended the quarter with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.27. Enterprise Base Business margins were lower than prior year. However, we still anticipate slight margin expansion for 2023. As we continue the Ascension integration, we overcome NHP supply issues, and we realized benefits from the LaunchPad initiative. We are continuing to implement cost controls across both businesses to offset inflationary pressures. Finally, COVID PCR testing volumes declined during the quarter, more than expected, totaling more than 870,000 tests performed and averaging 10,000 tests per day. We expect COVID testing to continue to decline. Glenn will provide additional detail on our quarterly results as well as our 2023 outlook in just a moment. Moving now to an update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development Business, we are on track to complete the spin midyear, subject to the regulatory approval process. We have confidence in the foundation that has been established despite short-term pressures. Fortrea will benefit from the leadership of Tom Pike as CEO. We plan to announce the leadership team and the Fortrea Board of Directors in the near future. We encourage you to visit fortrea.com to learn more. Upon completion, we'll create two strong independent companies through a tax-fee transaction. Both Labcorp and Fortrea will emerge from a transaction with their ability to better meet customer needs, to drive sustainable and profitable growth, and to deliver attractive shareholder returns. I'll now move to our enterprise strategy. We are laying the groundwork for the future by executing against our strategic initiatives. We continue to integrate Ascension assets and operations in the first quarter. Labcorp is now managing laboratories in nearly 100 Ascension hospitals. Ascension health system laboratories and other deals including our previously announced strategic relationship with RWJ Barnabus Health are strong proof points of our ability to generate growth through future healthcare system partnerships. Health systems are adapting to financial pressures, inflation, labor shortages, and other challenges, and they're seeking the right laboratory partner amidst these headwinds. We are working with our health system partners to develop tailored, innovative and cost effective solutions that meet the unique needs of their patients and providers. Last month, we entered into agreement with Enzo Biochem to acquire the assets of its clinical laboratory division. Today, we are in active discussions to expand relationships and execute new engagements with other partners. The pipeline for hospital and local lab acquisition and investment is robust. And we look forward to updating you on existing in new partnerships throughout the year. Turning to oncology, we partnered with ImmunoGen on an Immunohistochemistry sponsored testing program to increase access for patients with ovarian cancer. Additionally, Labcorp added HER2 low reporting to the IHC test for breast cancer. This test is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic of HER2 low status for patients with metastatic breast cancer, impacting patient eligibility for treatments and therapies that can improve outcomes. Labcorp also entered into a strategic collaboration with VieCure to provide clinicians greater access to precision oncology decision support. This collaboration builds on our capabilities to improve access to high quality care for cancer patients and their community cancer care providers. We continue to expand our digital health platform Labcorp OnDemand. We launched three new tests in the first quarter, including a PSA prostate cancer screening test, a hepatitis B immunity test, and a fatigue test for people with chronic fatigue systems including post-COVID fatigue. Before I wrap up, we are looking forward to two upcoming events though provide investors more color on our near to mid-term future. We have Fortrea Investor Day tentatively scheduled for June 6 in which we'll discuss the exciting opportunities ahead. We expect the Form 10 to be available in advance of the meeting. Additionally, we are planning a Labcorp Investor Day, which is tentatively scheduled for September. Labcorp is strong today and will emerge from the completion of the upcoming spin even stronger. Our diagnostics laboratory, early development research laboratory and central laboratory businesses are market leaders with solid fundamentals. We're executing against our long-term strategy that will position these businesses for continued growth in the future. I want to take a moment to thank our team for their continued contributions to Labcorp and our customers. The team is generating strong base business performance while preparing for transformational transaction mid-year. At more than 80,000 strong, our team works every day to find new ways to harness science, innovation, and technology for the betterment of our stakeholders. Labcorp is well-positioned to progress our mission to improve health and improve lives while generating attractive returns for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Good morning, Ann. Yes. Thank you, Ann, and good morning. So I'll give you some additional context on NHPs and where we stand. If you look at the first quarter, the NHP impact of early development was approximately $50 million to $60 million. But it's important to note that, that does not leverage well because we're continuing to hire people, and we're continuing to keep people because we now have enough supply that we feel confident in the second half of the year, and we feel confident as we go into next year. If you look at the underlying demand of the early development business, excluding that impact, it looks good. It actually grew 15% to 17%. So we feel good about the second half of the year for that reason. We said that the first quarter would have the highest impact of NHPs and there'll still be some impact in the second quarter. In the second quarter, we expect the impact to be between $30 million to $40 million. The reason why is, as we get supply in, it still takes time to acclimate and to train and to be ready for the new study starts. So we feel good about our supply situation. We feel good about the second half of the year. We feel good about going into next year. The first quarter was certainly the biggest impact of $50 million to $60 million. Second quarter would be less of an impact of $30 million to $40 million. But most importantly, the underlying early development business would have grown 15% to 17% had it not been for the NHPs. Good morning, Jack. Yes. So Jack, first of all, I'd say we're very pleased with the performance in diagnostics, every which way you look at it whether you look at esoteric, routine, look at our hospital, ex-hospital, if you look at our mix, we're looking very, very strong in the diagnostic business, and that enabled us to up the guidance range for that base business. If you look at volumes, specifically, the base business last year compared to this year, we're up 11% this year versus last year. About 2.5% of that was acquisitions, and then it was favorable weather and revenue days that was about 2%, but also remember comparing to last year where Omicron was impacting our business. So when you look, it's still very, very strong but it's a little bit more typical to what you would expect. As we look at the sequential difference, I feel really good about where we are with Ascension and things that are happening with not just the TSA, but also the acquisition part of Ascension in the business that we bought. But I'll see if Glenn wants to add some additional color. Yes. So I'll give some context and Glenn, if you could jump in as well. But we always said that the beginning when we first were doing the integration, the margin will be at the lowest point, which will be in the low-single digits. We're actually saying getting closer to the mid-single digits now, although not quite there. Over time, the margin will continue to improve. It will never reach the average margin of our current business. But we have already started to see some margin improvement, and we expect that that's going to continue as we go through this year into next year. Good morning, Kevin. Yes, glad to. And I'll first start off by saying that if you look at early development, as I said before, excluding the NHP constraints, the underlying business is strong. Same thing, I mean, if you look at our central laboratory business that looks very strong. And especially when you look at it in the CAGR, you can see strength in that business as well. It was a mixed quarter for the clinical development business, which I can talk about. But there are three things that impacted our margin significantly in the quarter that we think as we go through the year; at least two of them will start to look much better. The first one is NHP revenue. I already stated that was a $50 million to $60 million impact in first quarter. We expect it to be $30 million to $40 million in second quarter. That loss falls to the bottom line. It doesn't leverage well because we're continuing to hire people, and we're continuing to run that business like we didn't have the constraints. It's been hard to find people. It takes time to train people. It was one of the issues we faced last year. So we purposely decided to manage that business differently. Even though the revenue was down for the NHP constraints, we continue to hire people, and we continue to run the margins at a very low rate for that reason. The second thing is there was a write-down of bad debt for a small biotech company. It was one small company that actually went bankrupt and we had a write-off was about $10 million to $12 million. And then the third thing is we are seeing a bit of a lower burn rate in clinical. It's not surprising overly because we've seen kits coming back, not where they were prior to 2019. We think that's now flowing through a bit to the clinical business. But those three things we expect will get better the first two, certainly. The third one we think will continue to improve as we go through the year. Yes, I would say, in general, if you look at early development, we do much more of our backlog in small to medium biotech business, less as a percent in pharma. If you look at our clinical business, we do more in pharma, less in small biotech than we do in our fully development business. And then if you look at our Central Laboratory, it's pretty evenly split, but it's much more \u2013 I mean it's in between the two, but it's more towards large pharma than it is to small, medium-sized biotech. So I would say large pharma, middle-sized pharma is the majority of our book-to-bill in the clinical business as well as the central lab business. And it's much more skewed to small to medium-sized biotech in the early development business. And overall, the book-to-bill was 1.27 for the trailing 12 months. Yes, we don't really break it out that way. Obviously, as we get closer to spin, we will be breaking out differently than we do today. But at this time, we really haven't broken it out by the different business segments. Good morning, Brian. Good morning Patrick. Yes, hi Patrick, I'll start, and I'll ask Glenn to give some specifics. But in terms of payers, we have very good conversations with the payers, very constructive. I feel good about our access and the continued access that we will have. You continue to see price pressure in every single part of health care. But at the same time, we're not seeing any significant changes to the trends of what's happened in the past. So I feel good about price and price mix as we go through this year to next year. Maybe you can give some specifics, Glenn. Yes. What I would say there is overall, they represent a smaller part of our business, obviously than the mid to large size pharma and biotech. Some small companies are struggling a bit right now with cash, and you hear that a little bit, but it hasn't really impacted the flow of our RFPs or the dollar amount of our RFPs at the moment. But that's something that we're watching very closely. And obviously in the market environment that we're in, it's harder for these very small startup companies which represent a pretty small amount of our business frankly. Yes. Good morning, Derek. So Derek, I guess in February this year, we kind of gave our longer-term outlook of what we felt for diagnostics that we'd see kind of 2.5% to 4.5%. So little bit better than what we've done historically, again in that 3%-ish range. So to your point, the fact that we had such a strong quarter. In the first quarter to some extent, we had a soft quarter of a year ago because of Omicron. So we would expect volumes to be higher. But frankly, one of the reasons we talked about what our full year guidance is that we're tracking really well, we continue to see that favorable kind of 6%-ish number throughout this year as a base volume. But I think at this stage, when you look at the call it the CAGR to 2019 let's say how are we tracking we're doing around a 7% CAGR in diagnostics revenue compared to 2019 that's at the call the midpoint of our guidance. Ascension this year is going to benefit us around a couple of points, and we always have around a point for acquisition. So from a revenue standpoint, this year compared to pre-pandemic, we're growing it around 4%. So again, call it the middle to upper end of our targeted range. So again, part of the issues on a year-on-year comparison is that last year in diagnostics, given all the issues with COVID was softer than we expect. So now as we're coming through the recovery, we would expect the stronger growth rate, which is what we're experiencing. At this point, we have not, but we're in a lot of discussions. Good morning, Tim. Yes. I mean, the customers want to get their studies done and they understand the pricing issues that we're all facing. So they continue to fill the pipeline with studies that they want to complete, even though there are pricing issues that we're all facing. Yes. So I was very happy about the one year of PAMA reprieve. I wish we would've had legislation passed at the end of last year. SALSA certainly has bipartisan support and I'm glad it continues to have bipartisan support. So anybody I talk to, anybody that you give them the understanding of SALSA, I haven't read into anybody that doesn't understand the issues and isn't supportive. So I feel like we still have a good chance to get SALSA approved. I know our trade group, ACLA is working very hard to make sure that we continue to have our voice heard. And although, I continue to put in our base case that PAMA will impact us next year. I continue to be cautiously optimistic that we'll find a way to get some type of legislation approved as we go through this year. But I agree with you. It's not easy in the current environment. Yes. Thank you. And Eric, I don't think this is a new trend... Eric, I don't think this is a new trend or something that I think this was a very specific thing that happened here. No problem. Yes. The only thing I would add, Eric, is that the customers I've spoken to are pleased with the work we're doing. They're actually excited about the increased focus that will occur after the spin. It's temporary. They're just saying, you've said the spin is mid-year, get that done and then come back. So I think there's this short-term issue that we're facing. I don't get any sense that there's anything other than a short-term issue. In fact, the customers are excited about overall the spin. Thank you. Good morning, Erin. Thank you, Erin, for the question. I mean, the pipeline is robust. I would say, it's better today than it was a year ago. I mean, there's not too many deals the size of Ascension. But when you look at the number of deals and the number of health systems that we're talking to, I'm very pleased with where we are. We'll have more to announce as we move forward this year, so stay tuned. But it's a very robust pipeline of health systems and local laboratories that we're looking at. Yes. It was a renewal of a large pharma FSP. And the reason I think it's important is because as we're going through the spin, I mentioned that some customers are excited about the spin, but they've said, let's wait until after the spin, we'll talk about more business. This large pharma company said, no, we're so pleased with the work that you've done that we want to renew that FSP now. So it just gives you a sense that we are continuing to have good momentum as we go into the spin and through the spin, despite some short-term pressures there. Thank you. Well, thank you for joining us today. We're continuing to drive performance across our businesses, while we're making great progress towards completing the planned mid-year spin of clinical development. We look forward to updating you further at our upcoming Fortrea Investor Day in June. And I can't wait to provide you with additional information about Labcorp and the bright future, I believe we have in September. Talk to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of first quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we have also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency. This was partially offset by organic based business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 84% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew 9.8% compared to the base business last year. Organically in constant currency, the base business grew 9.2%, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth. Operating income for the quarter was $341 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $69 million of amortization and $83 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related acquisitions, LaunchPad initiatives, and the proposed spin of Fortrea. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $494 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $794 million or 20.4% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing demand. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mixed impact from the Ascension TSA and NHP related constraints. Excluding these items, margins would've been up slightly as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially upset by higher personnel expense, inflationary costs, and increased R&D investments in oncology. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the three year period ending 2024. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 23.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from increased R&D tax credits. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $213 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.82 in the quarter, down 37% from last year due to lower COVID testing earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up 10%. Operating cash flow was $121 million in the quarter compared to $356 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower COVID testing earnings and spin related costs, partially offset by higher base business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $94 million down from $117 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was $27 million and the company paid out $64 million in dividends. The first quarter is generally the company's softest quarter for free cash flow. We continue to expect our full year free cash flow to be between $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Now review our segment performance beginning with diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, driven by organic revenue being down 4.7%, which was due to COVID testing, partially offset by acquisitions of 2%. COVID testing revenue was down 84% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew organically by 17.5% compared to the base business last year. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth, while the impact of weather and revenue days benefited growth by approximately 2%. Total volume decreased 3.3% compared to last year, as organic volume decreased by 5.6%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 2.3%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 11% compared to base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.6% and favorable weather and revenue days of approximately 2%. The strong year-over-year growth rate was also impacted by lower than normal volume in the first quarter of 2022, due to Omicron. Price mix increased 0.4% versus last year as the base business improved 6.6% and was partially offset by lower COVID testing of 5.7%, currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Base business price mix was up 8.8% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $442 million or 18.5% of revenue compared to $683 million or 27.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing, which carried a margin of approximately 50% for the quarter. Going forward, we expect a lower margin for COVID testing, but still above the segment average. Base business margin was up approximately 80 basis points driven by organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense and the mix impact from the Ascension TSA. Now review the performance of drug development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to last year, primarily due to decreased organic revenue of 2.4% and foreign currency of 1.5%. The decrease in adjusted organic revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 8% due to NHP related constraints, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work, and the previously mentioned FSP contract loss. The early development business was the most constrained by these items. Excluding these impacts, organic base business revenue for the segment grew approximately 6% with early development up 17%, central lab up 6% and clinical development up 3%. Reported first quarter drug development revenues on a compounded annual basis grew 6.9% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $124 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to $169 million or 11.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to NHP-related constraints, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work and the FSP contract loss, which negatively impacted margins by approximately 350 basis points. Excluding these items, margins would have increased primarily due to demand and LaunchPad savings being partially offset by higher personnel expense, inflationary costs and a write-off of receivables related to small biotech customers. We ended the quarter with backlog of $16.6 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our updated 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2023 for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Also, our guidance assumes that Fortrea will be part of Labcorp for the full year. Following its spin currently anticipated in the middle of the year, we expect to provide updated guidance. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.5% to 4% compared to 2022. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 25 basis points. This increase reflects the base business range increasing to 9.5% to 11%, while COVID testing guidance range has been lowered to minus 80% to 90%. We continue to perform well in diagnostics and are taking up our full year guidance range. We expect diagnostics revenue to be down 0.5% to up 2% compared to 2022, this is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 100 basis points, primarily due to stronger base business volume. This guidance includes the expectation that the Base Business will now grow 12.5% to 14%, which has approximately 5% growth due to Ascension. We expect Diagnostics Base Business margin to be up in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension. We expect drug development revenue to grow 3.5% to 5.5% compared to 2022. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 150 basis points due to slower-than-expected backlog conversion, primarily due to investigator site constraints and lower-than-expected first quarter orders. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 60 basis points. At the midpoint of our guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 6.8%, primarily due to organic growth. We also continue to expect that the drug development margin will increase slightly in 2023 compared to 2022. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16.25 to $17.75. This is a tightening of the range from our prior guidance, while the midpoint is unchanged. This guidance reflects lower earnings from COVID testing; while Base Business adjusted EPS is expected to increase 15% at the midpoint. Free cash flow guidance is $1 billion to $1.2 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to continue to decline through the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through a share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions. No. I think that hits it in. I think anytime you look especially in the diagnostics business, we've talked about the seasonality of the business. So looking at sequential, you do have to factor in those issues of days, if you will, obviously the impact of acquisitions that are annualizing as well as the \u2013 I guess, the fundamental issue that Adam spoke to is just we continue to see strong demand as we go forward. And the year-over-year comps look good and sequentially, similarly we expect the growth to continue throughout the year. Yes. Just, and it speaks a little to the early \u2013 the earlier question two [ph] on the sequential. We continue to see revenues within Ascension continue to grow. So it grew sequentially. We're still, as you'll recall when we announced the transaction, expected around $550 million to $600 million in revenue based upon our current guidance, our revenue would be at the upper end or maybe even slightly above it. It's going to contribute around 5% of our growth this year, and as you know, it will annualize after the third quarter. So the fourth quarter comp will have it in both periods. So we're seeing good growth. Obviously, it impacted our revenue in the first quarter, call it around 7.5% year-on-year. So the revenues are coming in nicely. And as Adam said, while we talked about mid-to \u2013 we're low-to-mid-single digit margins, we're kind of at the upper end of that range right now with the expectation that margin growth or improvement will continue as we go forward through the year, but especially beyond that. Yes. I'd say the other thing, too, Kevin, if you look at the first quarter, and again, it goes back a little bit to the seasonality question; first quarter margins for drug development are historically the lowest. And if you looked at what we did last year, we did around 11.6% in margin. But for the full year, we delivered 14% margins. When you look at this year, obviously, we have a low first quarter margin. But our expectation is that it will be slightly above next year, in part, the constraints that I have said, but the top line growth that we expect in the business that's implied in our revenue guidance would get you roughly around 7.5% for the remaining nine months. So, top line growth, LaunchPad savings, not having the constraints will drive the margin improvement. Yes, thank you. So no, we have seen the trend go down. If you look at the fourth quarter, we were rounding around 30% backlog conversion where this quarter, we're kind of at the 29.5%. So, we have seen kind of the trend down. We'd assume that this level going forward. So, when you look at the call down in our revenue outlook for the year, that effectively was half of the reason for the decline with the other being a little bit of softer orders that we had in the first quarter that, as you know, we still need roughly around 20% of current year revenues to come from new orders as we did see a little bit of a softness there. But overall, we're looking at the backlog, we're looking at the contracts that we have, the burn rate that we currently see from those contracts, and we feel comfortable with the current expectation. Frankly, there's always a range that you can say that we can see it pick up a bit. There were a couple of large contracts in particular that caused the conversion to come a little bit lower. So once those burn through a little bit or the mix improves, hopefully, we'll see a little bit of a pickup. But for right now, that kind of 29.5-ish kind of percent conversion is what we're assuming. Sure, Patrick. When you look at the \u2013 we talked about the 7.5% kind of growth this year organically in diagnostics. The price mix benefit from that was a little over 9%, 9.2%. We commented that extension the TSA we treat as all price. So that was 7.5%, if you will. So we did around, call it 1.7% in price mix, which is not too dissimilar when you back out the ascension to where we've done \u2013 where we've been. We continue to track well. When you look at even our guidance for the full year, which will help kind of convey what we continue to expect, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we have around 13.25% growth. We're picking up around close to 5% from Ascension as well as probably around 1.5 points from M&A. So overall, call it, that midpoint, excluding Ascension and acquisitions, we'd be up around 7%. So we're tracking similarly. We expect roughly around 6% of it from volume, 1% of it from price, again, now that it doesn't include the Ascension. So historically, we would have said organic revenue or volume of, call it, around 2%. You pick up a point from a price mix of 3%. So where we see price right now continues to be pretty consistent with that. And as Adam said, the payer mix has helped. We continue to see a positive trend in our tests per Ascension. We continue to see a positive trend with our esoteric growing faster than routine. We also picked up a little bit on the draw fee, but we continue to do headwinds from unit pricing. So the fact that we continue to see price mixed favorable is really the mix impact of our business more than offsetting any pricing headwinds. Yes. The only thing, I'd add too is which to your point, so the large or the small but biotech customer that went bankrupt was around $5 million of the $12 million that we put in place. So we built up reserves just given the current environment to make sure that if were there any other issues that we would have that we feel that were adequately reserved for. But as Adam said, small part of the business we're just being hopefully prudent in establishing the reserve for the potential that some other smaller players could have some issues. And the only thing I would add to that is, with the health systems that we're winning and the pipeline that we have, I do believe that there's spillover that occurs in the surrounding geographies when you win those health systems. It's very hard to quantify. But I believe that it helps with our underlying demand. Yes. This is I think we commented on \u2013 I believe on the last question or two, the $12 million that we took was both a write-down of a receivable from a customer that went bankrupt as well as a buildup of reserves. So the $5 million exposure we did have to a small biotech customer that obviously had gone on for a while before they obviously went bankrupt. And so that was the write-off. The other $7 million again, which is unusual to your point, we normally don't speak about bad debt with regard to our drug development business, but in the current environment, we felt it was appropriate to build up an additional reserve just given what's going on rather than just do it once and then if something occurs later, we do it again. So we feel we're adequately reserved in the current environment, but again, which is unusual, but that's the \u2013 extent is the $12 million is a total and the $5 million is unique to that one customer. Yes. So overall, we talked about the CMS reimbursement at around a $100 and obviously our average is probably in the low to mid-80s overall. But we've talked about that post public health emergency that we expect that the CMS reimbursement rate will call it drop in half. So ultimately, that's where we're coming down on pricing. And then the volumes we spoke to, we did around 10,000 PCR tests per day in the quarter. Really, we're currently at a rate that's closer to 5,000 and that's really our expectation going forward. So you're looking at relatively low volumes at kind of half of the pricing. So it's going to come off of the 50% that's benefiting from full pricing and stronger volume. But we do believe that the overall margin, if you look at the base businesses in the high teens, you should \u2013 we currently expect that to call it the COVID margins will at least start with the two. So it'll be greater than the margins that we have for the overall segment, but again, at lower volumes. Yes. So when we provided the book-to-bill, yes, we normally focus on the trailing 12, which as Adam said was a 1.27. We do in our supplemental information provide the quarterly, which was at a 1.18. So overall, the orders or the book-to-bill continues to be what we feel healthy overall, again, focusing more on the trailing 12. We did comment on the \u2013 in Adam's remarks that we did have the benefit of an FSP renewal contract in the \u2013 of the quarter. So, which again, periodically comes up. But overall, the backlog looks good, the conversion's a little bit lower, but we also spoke to that in the first quarter, we saw orders come in softer than what we expected. And to your point, it's really all driven on our clinical business, which again, in part is the issue with spending all this time on the spin. Adam commented that some of the customers are waiting before giving us orders until after the spin is up and running independent and very focused going forward. But the overall, book-to-bill, we always try to shoot for a 1.2 to be able to support mid to high single digit growth rates. And currently, even for the quarter, we're at a 1.18, but again, benefiting with a renewal of an FSP."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Christin O\u2019Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristin O\u2019Donnell: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp\u2019s third quarter 2024 conference call. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, both of which are discussed during today\u2019s call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2024 guidance and the related assumptions, the spin-off of Fortrea Holdings, Inc., the impact of various factors on the company\u2019s businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings, benefits and synergies from the LaunchPad initiative and from acquisitions and other strategic transactions and partnerships, the completed holding company reorganization and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter financial performance and progress against our strategy. Before discussing our results, we\u2019d like to acknowledge the communities across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, including our home state of North Carolina, which continues to face the devastating effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Our thoughts are with those impacted, including our employees and residents of those communities across several states, who are grappling with a long recovery ahead. We continue to support relief and recovery efforts as a member of the American Red Cross Disaster Response program. Turning to our results for the quarter. We continue to perform very well across both diagnostics labratories and biopharma laboratory services. Our results reflect strong growth in diagnostics and central laboratories, driven by strong volume and core performance and by advancements in science, technology and innovation. Let\u2019s start by reviewing our financial results. Revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Diagnostics continued to deliver strong revenue growth, up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5%, while biopharma laboratory services revenue grew approximately 3%, driven by strong growth in central labs of 9%, partially offset by the expected decline of 11% in early development. We continue to expect early development to show year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the book-to-bill to grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s overlapping with a very strong fourth quarter last year. Overall, the book-to-bill remains healthy for continued growth. Adjusted EPS of $3.50 was up 4% year-over-year. Enterprise margins were down 40 basis points due to the impacts renminbi has. We expect to finish the year with solid growth across both diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services. Glenn will provide more details on our results in just a moment. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities by being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories by harnessing science and innovation to expand our leadership in important therapeutic areas and by utilizing data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers. In the third quarter, Labcorp continued to advance in these strategic growth areas. First, we maintained a leadership position as a partner of choice for health systems. During the third quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire select operating assets of Ballad Health outreach lab services. Ballad Health expands our comprehensive laboratory and testing capabilities to rural communities in Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky. We also entered into a strategic collaboration with Naples Comprehensive Healthcare in Southwest Florida to manage the daily operations of its inpatient laboratory operations. Turning to regional and local laboratories. We signed a new agreement to acquire select assets of Lab Works, an independent clinical laboratory located in Alabama. And we closed the previously announced acquisition of select assets of BioReference\u2019s Health laboratory testing business. We continue to have a strong business development pipeline, and we look forward to sharing more of those details in the future. We also made several notable advances in science, technology and innovation in the quarter through strategic acquisitions, investments and new product launches. First, we completed the acquisition of select assets of Invitae during the quarter. Performance was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect it to be slightly accretive to earnings for 2025 with top line growth of approximately 10%. We are excited about Invitae\u2019s complementary cutting edge science, their genetic testing solutions and technology, which aligns strategically with Labcorp\u2019s focus on specialty medicine and oncology. The acquisition extends our leadership in specialty testing capabilities and our ability to utilize genetic data to improve clinical trials and treatment regimens in oncology and select rare diseases. By integrating Invitae\u2019s genetic testing technology with Labcorp\u2019s specialty testing capabilities, we can offer a more complete set of insights for each patient from testing to diagnosis to treatment. The integration is on track with our financial goals without impacting the great science and customer experience that Invitae provides today. In July, we announced an expanded collaboration with Ultima Genomics to utilize its sequencing solution and technology to explore new whole genome sequencing clinical applications, including MRD in patients with early-stage solid tumor cancers. In August, Labcorp received de novo marketing authorization from the FDA for our PGDx elio plasma focus Dx, the industry\u2019s only kitted, pan-solid tumor liquid biopsy test. This test enables laboratory to perform genomic profiling when tissue is limited or unavailable. Labcorp has an industry-leading comprehensive oncology testing menu, and we are uniquely positioned as the only company offering FDA-authorized kitted solutions for both tissue and liquid-based solid tumor testing. We also continue to expand our Labcorp OnDemand offerings with additional consumer-initiated tests in July and August, including Syphilis and Luteinizing Hormone tests. Subsequent to the quarter end, we announced an exclusive agreement with NowDiagnostics to distribute the first over-the-counter, point-of-care Syphilis blood test granted marketing authorization by the FDA. We plan to make the test available to providers by the end of 2024 and directly to patients through Labcorp OnDemand in 2025. In the quarter, we also made improvements to our customer experience, using data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers. We introduced a new order tracking experience to our diagnostic customers, giving the majority of providers\u2019 real-time visibility of test order status. This new capability offers comprehensive sample tracking enhancing providers\u2019 ability to manage patient care effectively with clear up-to-date information on all test orders. Ovia Health by Labcorp announced the expansion of its women health solutions to include a personalized, comprehensive postpartum experience. This 12-month program is designed to help women manage multiple aspects of the postpartum period through personalized recovery modes, symptom tracking and alerts and mental health support. I am proud of our accomplishments and how we operate as an organization. We recently earned Ethisphere\u2019s Compliance Leader Verification, which recognizes organizations with an outstanding commitment to achieving a best-in-class ethics and compliance program. Ethics and integrity are at the heart of everything we do, and integral to our mission to improve health and improve lives. We were also proud to be named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion after earning the top score of 100 by the 2024 Disability Equality Index. In the quarter, Congress delayed the implementation of PAMA, removing a potential $80 million revenue headwind in 2025. While we are pleased with this further delay, we continue to work closely with our trade associations to seek a permanent fix to PAMA as there is bipartisan recognition that long-term reform is needed. In conclusion, we continue to execute well on our short-term financial commitments while also making progress on our longer-term strategy. I am confident in our growth opportunities and we remain on track to achieve our longer term outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I\u2019m going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we\u2019ve also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions. The base business grew 8% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 4.8%. Operating income for the quarter was $254 million, or 7.7% of revenue, or 13.4% on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, we had $105 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $18 million of expense for the transition service agreements related to the spin-off Fortrea with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $64 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $441 million, or 13.4% of revenue, compared to $424 million, or 13.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs and the loss from Invitae. The 40 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin was due to Invitae. Excluding Invitae as well as the impact from weather and days, margins would have been up approximately 120 basis points. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% compared to 24% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $170 million or $2 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.50 in the quarter, up 4% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $277 million in the quarter, which included an expected use of cash from Invitae compared to $276 million a year ago. Capital expenditures totaled $116 million in the quarter, or 3.5% of revenue. This compares to $105 million, or 3.4% in the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $162 million. During the quarter, the company invested $458 million in acquisitions, paid down $61 million in dividends and repurchased $75 million of stock. At quarter end, we had $1.5 billion in cash, while debt was $6.8 billion. These higher balances are due to the prefunding of maturing debt. During the quarter, the company raised $2 billion of long-term notes to prefund $2 billion of maturing debt. The company expects to use cash to pay down the remaining $1.4 billion of debt, maturing over the next four months. Our current debt leverage is 2.4x net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now I\u2019ll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year, with organic growth of 5% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 4%. The base business grew 9.8% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 5.8%. Total volume increased 5.1% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 5.6% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 2.7%, which was negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points from weather, while acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Price mix increased 3.8% versus last year due to organic base business growth and acquisitions that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price mix was up 3% compared to the base business last year due to mix as we benefited from lab management agreements, an increase in test per accession and esoteric testing growing faster than routine. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $387 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $386 million, or 16.5% last year. Adjusted operating margin was down 130 basis points due to Invitae and the unfavorable impacts of days and weather. Excluding these items, margins would have been up around 80 basis points as the benefit of organic demand and LaunchPad savings was partially offset by higher personnel costs. Now I\u2019ll review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $738 million, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 2% and foreign currency translation of 0.6%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in central labs, which was up 9%, while early development was down 11%, primarily due to higher-than-normal cancellations in prior periods. However, early development revenue increased sequentially from the second quarter, and we continue to expect it to grow year-over-year, beginning in the fourth quarter. Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $121 million, or 16.4% of revenue, compared to $109 million, or 15.2% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.1 billion, and we expect approximately $2.6 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.02. Now I\u2019ll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, including acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 6.6% to 7.3% compared to 2023. Versus prior guidance, the midpoint is unchanged as a benefit of 20 basis points from foreign currency is being offset by a negative 20 basis points from weather. We continue to perform well in diagnostics with revenue expected to be up 7.2% to 7.8% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 10 basis points due to the improved outlook within diagnostics. The acquisition of select assets of BioReference that was previously only included in the enterprise guidance until the transaction closed is benefiting diagnostics growth by 30 basis points. This is being offset by the unfavorable impact from weather of 30 basis points. We expect biopharma revenue to grow 4.7% to 5.6% compared to 2023. The midpoint of our guidance increased 80 basis points due to the favorable impact from foreign currency of 100 basis points, partially offset by a slower recovery in early development of 20 basis points. We continue to expect early development to grow revenue year-over-year beginning in the fourth quarter. We expect enterprise margins to be slightly down year-over-year with diagnostics margins constrained by Invitae and weather. We expect biopharma margins to be up year-over-year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $14.70. We have decreased the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 due to the estimated impact from weather of $0.15. Our free cash flow guidance range is $850 million to $980 million. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: Good morning. Just heading into 2025 is there any specific headwinds and tailwinds that you would like to call out? And then secondly, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re seeing some of the late-stage probably traded peers have not done really well this quarter. Revenue growth is declining or I should say, accelerating, but it seems like the opposite is happening to your central lab. How should we think about the impact of what\u2019s happening with some of your customers from a timing perspective? Do you expect that to impact revenue? Is there a lag 6 months, 12 months? How should we view it in the future? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. I\u2019ll start with 2025. And so first of all, I feel great about the momentum that we have in both our diagnostics and central laboratory business, and we expect early development is going to grow in the fourth quarter and will grow as we go into 2025. We\u2019re not giving any 2025 guidance today. But as you look at our longer-term guidance, where we have organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5%, plus another 1.5% to 2.5% growth for inorganic growth, we remain on track, and we\u2019re going to be entering 2025 with real momentum and strength. As I think about the central laboratory business, it continues to perform very well. Central laboratory had very strong growth year-over-year of 9%. I would say that, that\u2019s based off of an easy compare last year because as you recall last year, there was a lot of sites that didn\u2019t have the ability to enroll patients. They have staffing issues and so forth. But as we look forward into the future and I look at the longer-term guidance for BLS, I expect central labs will be consistent with that guidance and show continued growth. If you look at the central lab books, we have solid orders, we have good, consistent win rates and we are a leader in that field. And in that field, the majority of our business is with larger pharma. It\u2019s much less with the smaller biotechnology companies.\nAnn Hynes: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Lisa.\nLisa Gill: Good morning, Adam and Glenn. Just wanted to follow-up on Invitae and the margin progression. So you talked about the impact in the quarter. As I think about going into 2025, like how should I think about, one, that margin progression? And then secondly, is there anything to call out when you think about the mix in the diagnostics business? And we look at the price per rack coming in much better than what we had anticipated in our model.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So let me start first with Invitae. So we continue to be really excited about their science, their genetic testing solutions and technology that they have and it really aligns with us strategically. The integration is going extremely well. We\u2019re on track with all the integration metrics that we have in place. If you look at the financial metrics, we\u2019re performing as we expected based upon what we provided guidance last quarter. And as you look at this year, we expect that there\u2019ll be an impact of about 40 basis points negative, but as we go into next year we expect Invitae to be slightly accretive. So you can assume if it\u2019s negative in the first two quarters of the launch, and it\u2019s slightly accretive for the full year that it will take us a little bit of time as we go through the year before you see that accretion occur. But overall, we remain very bullish about that acquisition and the revenue growth will be about 10% as we think about next year as well. And then in terms of mix, I\u2019ll ask Glenn to provide some comments.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. First, just also just wrapping up on the Invitae as well as Adam commented that yes, we would expect margin improvement sequentially going forward. So each quarter that we have as we integrate the business, it will improve will still show negative comps on margin year-on-year through the first half of next year just until it annualizes. And then Lisa, once it\u2019s annualized, you\u2019d expect to see that margin improvement or be a tailwind to margins beginning in the second half of next year. With the price mix, we actually had a good top line growth within diagnostics overall. If you look at our base business organically, we grew around 6%, and that was pretty evenly split between utilization. Volume was up around 2.7%, and even that was constrained by weather of around 40 basis points. But to your earlier comment, the mix impact, we were up around 3%. And really, what drove that this quarter more than anything was the in-hospital lab management agreements, which we continue to do, and we treat that as price mix, but we\u2019ve also seen a steady increase in our test per session, which we\u2019ve seen over time that continues to progress and we continue to see growth in more of our esoteric business growing faster than our routine. So really, the combination of those three things is what drove the favorable mix this quarter.\nLisa Gill: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe to comment the margin question a different way. I know it\u2019s hard just because moving pieces, especially stuff I would say is out of your control, obviously, Invitae. But as you think about the savings that you\u2019ve been able to generate on the cost side, as you think about where you\u2019ve landed, I think I heard 120 basis points of underlying margin expansion in your view [indiscernible] weather, et cetera. Where you think have been the most successful sources of margin expansion? How do we think about the pull-through on what still remains an elevated revenue growth level on incremental pull-through versus restructuring? And I guess to Lisa\u2019s question a little bit, how do we think about the cost-cutting impacts of above and beyond Invitae playing forward into 2025, both within LaunchPad and outside?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So Michael, I\u2019ll take a first cut of it and Adam may want to add as well. But we actually do feel very good about the underlying performance of the company. And to your point, we have a bunch of headwinds that we\u2019ve identified that we call obviously, would be more nonoperational, the strategic acquisition that we did with Invitae, the impact of weather and this quarter and actually will also have a quarter impact in the fourth quarter from just days, so kind of timing related. And so that gets to that 120 basis point expansion that you commented about. But the underlying business, when we take those out and also we obviously still have a little bit of a headwind from COVID testing, that\u2019s now leveled off, but still year-over-year, it\u2019s a negative impact. But the underlying business, we\u2019re benefiting from the top line growth. We\u2019re benefiting from our LaunchPad initiatives. We\u2019re still on track to $100 million to $125 million of our LaunchPad savings. So as we think about operating leverage, ideally, we target kind of around a gross margin. When you kind of peel out those unusual items, if you will, or the headwinds that we had, we\u2019re operating in the high 20s, and frankly, a little stronger even in the third quarter. But we\u2019re kind of in the ballpark of our gross margins. So we think underlying our business where we need to be. What\u2019s interesting as well is a lot of the headwinds that we\u2019re having this year in 2024 will become tailwinds to our margins next year. So we still expect our underlying performance to be good. But then when you think about Invitae, when you think about days, obviously, if we would have normal weather, all those three headwinds that we had this year will become tailwinds to margins next year.\nAdam Schechter: And the only thing I would add to that is when we talk about LaunchPad, it really is continuous improvement. And we know as we go into the future, we\u2019re going to have to continually find ways to reduce costs to improve margins. And I think with all the work that we\u2019re doing with technology, with some of the work that we\u2019re doing with artificial intelligence, we see other opportunities now above and beyond what we\u2019ve talked about in the past to continue to find ways to reduce costs moving forward. So that\u2019s just something that\u2019s built into our DNA as a company, and we\u2019re going to continue to find ways to reduce costs where we can.\nMichael Cherny: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just ask on the diagnostics business. Just the core utilization trends you guys are seeing, obviously, again, the weather impact moves things around a little bit. But what you\u2019re seeing there and just the expectations going forward, certainly, looking eyes are turning towards 2025, as you talked a little bit about here. Any reason why you wouldn\u2019t kind of be inside that LRP as you think about utilization rate and heading into next year?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. Patrick, as you look at utilization rates, we certainly see acceleration in healthcare overall. And the question is with what hospitals have seen and other parts of healthcare, will that continue? I would expect at some point that will slow down a bit to more historic levels. But at the same time, with our business, I believe we\u2019re seeing share increases in particular as we do more of these hospital deals and the local regional laboratory deals. So when you look at our longer-term guidance for diagnostics, we expect organic revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. And then on top of that, inorganic, which we\u2019ve actually increased our longer-term inorganic growth expectations, historically, it was 1% to 2%, now we have it at 1.5% to 2.5%. So when you look at those numbers, I would tell you that we expect continued strong momentum as we move forward with the business.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great, thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Erin.\nErin Wright: Thanks. Good morning. You spoke to some of the pricing dynamics in ASPs, but I guess, how would you characterize just underlying kind of current payer relationships in the pricing environment around those? And I think you have a new Blues relationship. I guess anything else to call out, or what does that add for you or anything else to call out from a payer relationship standpoint? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes, sure. No, we continue to feel very good about our managed care discussions and the contracts that we\u2019ve negotiated. We\u2019re very confident that the renewals that we\u2019ve secured are good terms. And if you look across everything we\u2019ve done this year, we believe, as we move forward, net-net, we\u2019re neutral to slightly positive, which historically, that has not been the case. So, I feel great about the different managed care discussions that we\u2019ve had this year. Our position as we go into 2025 is strong. I don\u2019t see any major contracts that I\u2019m concerned about. So I think that the momentum will continue.\nErin Wright: Great. And then on early development, I guess, can you parse out a little bit more how you\u2019re thinking about the quarterly progression from here? Just given some of the lumpiness across kind of that business, I guess, how are you thinking about the longer-term performance across early development, has anything changed in terms of your long-term goals and then how you get to kind of that fourth quarter ramp? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I\u2019ll give some comments and I\u2019ll ask for Glenn to jump in as well. If you look at our early development business, we certainly saw sequential positive growth in terms of revenue. We saw less of a decline in third quarter as a percent that we saw in second quarter. As we move into fourth quarter, we have good insight to the studies are underway. It\u2019s not like we have to get new studies to understand what fourth quarter is going to look like. Based upon what we see today, we expect that there will be growth in early development in the fourth quarter. Now to be fair, it\u2019s off of a relatively easy comparison versus fourth quarter of last year. And as we go into next year, and the book-to-bill continues to build, and the cancellations continue to hold, then we would expect to see growth as well, but also based upon an easier compare because this year, it continued to struggle for several quarters. So over time, we continue to have good expectations for that business. We are a leader in that field. I believe that the biotechnology companies with interest rates should continue to do well. And over time, that business has had some cyclical ups and downs, but over time, it\u2019s a very good business.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is as you think about even just the segment, the implied guide for the fourth quarter is revenue growth of call it, 9.5%. So obviously, a lot stronger, around six points higher than what we had for the first nine months. Currency is around two points of that. But the underlying 4% really the strong improvement is being driven off of early development. You would have seen that on a, call it, the nine months, we\u2019re down around 11% in early development business, but we expect positive year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. And as Adam said, we have a soft comp in the fourth quarter. But more importantly, we saw sequential growth in ED in the third quarter from the second. We expect to see sequential growth again in the fourth quarter. Obviously, given the time of the year with the fourth quarter, we\u2019re effectively now executing on our backlog where this is in the business a little bit more difficult to forecast because of the short nature of the studies. So, you count on the new business coming in to turn into revenues in the same quarter. So, we feel pretty good about the outlook, the growth. And as Adam said, the long term for biopharma, we\u2019re looking kind of at the midpoint of our growth rate of 6%. So, we\u2019re already there and doing well within Central Lab. ED, obviously, is now going to be positive, and you would expect given the lower comp, there to be even a little bit higher growth rates over the next couple of years coming from ED, including from the margins. Again, one of the benefits of the tailwinds as we think about 2025 just with that top line growth we\u2019ll also get positive margin improvement there as well.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, David.\nDavid Westenberg: Hey good morning. And thank you for taking the question. So, just another one on the LRP and as we look into next year, I mean, it sounds like you have a lot of favorable things in the environment. You raised your inorganic outlook because of lab acquisitions, PAMA looks like it\u2019s on hold for next year. Biotech funding is at least not getting worse. Is there anything else to flag in the industry or Labcorp specific that would might be a surprise into the LRP? And then can you just remind us the factors associated with the high end and the low end of the LRP, because it definitely seems like all of the macro factors are working kind of in the favor? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So again, without giving specific 2025 guidance today, which we\u2019ll give in February of next year, we have momentum. And you can feel the momentum you\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters. Diagnostics business continues to perform well, both organically and inorganically, central laboratories performing well and ED will be back to growth. As I think about PAMA, we still have an impact of PAMA in the longer-term guidance. And we just pushed it out a year. There is another year. So, if PAMA were to be pushed out again, obviously, that would have a positive impact on our longer-term guidance. But until such a point I am confident that there won\u2019t be an impact of PAMA in 2026. We continue to keep it in our longer-term guidance and model. We continue to watch the broader trends, the utilization rates the business development that we\u2019re doing and the trends remain strong. So, barring surprises, we remain confident as we look at the momentum we have.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, I would agree. The other thing, as you look at normally the upside on ranges in the downside, obviously, is demand driven to get to the upside or maybe some unforeseen headwinds. And as Adam said, where we sit today and is, again, we\u2019ll comment more about 2025, which would be the second year into our long-term ranges, if you will. We feel\u2019s very good about the ranges just even from a just general profile of kind of that mid-single-digit top line growth organically, margin improvement, capital allocation that will help fuel top line growth through acquisitions as well as strong cash for free cash flow to get to a double-digit earnings per share kind of growth profile. So, we feel very good. And even with some of the headwinds, tailwinds, as Adam said, we got the benefit from PAMA being delayed, but still within the range from a margin profile and revenue. And the flip side is on Invitae, a strategic deal we did, but that would be call it, dilutive to the margins, if you will, relative to our general profile that we would put in there. So overall, net-net, we feel pretty good about the ranges that we have.\nDavid Westenberg: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Good morning. I wanted to start with Invitae. For Glen, within the M&A contribution in the quarter, can you just call out how much of the sales came from Invitae? I penciled in $45 million. Is that a good bogey? And then for Adam, the hereditary market is pretty competitive, just any perspective in the early days of the deal how any share shifts are going? Thank you.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, I\u2019ll take the Jack, the first one on Invitae. And Adam, I think, mentioned it in his opening comments, we\u2019re pretty much in line with expectations. So, we originally said that for the year, we pick up around 120-ish of revenues, and it would be weighted kind of 50% and 70% between the third and the fourth. So your number for the third is in line with what our expectation is. But across the board for Invitae, we feel very good about the integration that\u2019s going on, what was expected and continue to drive to get that to be obviously positive from an earnings and a margin standpoint next year.\nAdam Schechter: And Jeff, with regard to the [indiscernible] market, and we\u2019ve been competing in that market for quite some time. Invitae was an additional way for us to be a larger competitor in that market. So we know it well. We know how to compete in it. We know how to win in it. It\u2019s still early days, frankly, when you look at revenue, but so far so good. And our customers seem to be pleased to now have Labcorp testing capabilities available to them. We\u2019re continuing to work on the customer experience, so it could become much easier for the customers over time to order directly all the tests that they might want for a patient for women\u2019s health or for oncology. So I think over time, we\u2019re going to continue to do very well. The 10% growth that we expect in revenue is almost what the market is growing. So my hope is, over time, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate that. But in the meantime, we\u2019re basically saying we\u2019re going to grow at about the market rate.\nJack Meehan: Awesome. One follow-up for Glenn. Just with all the debt refinancing underway, could you just share like \u2013 and I am sorry if I missed this in the opening remarks, what your forecast was for interest expense this year? And is there any color you can share online what the moving parts would suggest number might be for 2025? Thank you.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, Jack, I think on our last call, when we knew we were going through the financings at that time, we kind of talked just in line of around $210 million of interest expense for this year, growing to $240 million. We did all of our financings, we actually feel good about where we came out. We raised the $2 billion of debt. We actually had an order book of over $8.5 billion. So, we were able to get tighter pricing, and we hit the market at a good time. So directionally, I assume that we\u2019re coming in a little bit better on the interest expense this year. And therefore, and next, obviously, the bulk of it will be annualized for next year, but the year-over-year change should be comparable, but the overall \u2013 the absolute number should be a little bit favorable to what we shared before.\nJack Meehan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning Pito.\nPito Chickering: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. If I could ask a managed care question, slightly different than Erin\u2019s. A competitor this week is talking about expanding a deal with a large national payer in three states, where it looks like you had an exclusive deal and then losing a state or it looks like you won. So, looking at the total volumes with managed care for 2025, will there be headwinds or tailwinds with the contract movements that is occurring for next year?\nAdam Schechter: Yes. So Peter, as you look across all of our contracts that we negotiated as we went through this year, net-net I think, it looks really good. And in fact, it\u2019s going to be neutral to slightly positive for us. If you look at areas in general, I prefer nonexclusive contracts overall. And I\u2019ve been saying that for five years now, because I think when you have exclusive contracts with managed organizations, it just leads to price erosion every three or four years. Whereas if you have open contracts, I think, you can compete in the marketplace, and we compete very well in the marketplace. And when exclusive contracts open up, typically the rate structures change as well. So, there\u2019s not significant downside in many ways in that case also. So I feel very good about our managed care position, I feel very good about the momentum that we have in managed care as we go into next year.\nPito Chickering: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Hi.\nAndrew Brackmann: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions Adam. Adam, maybe just following up on your comments related to the oncology offering. You guys have expanded that portfolio nicely over the last few years. So, can you maybe just sort of talk about the trends you saw this quarter in those advanced cancer tests? And just how are you sort of thinking about future growth there over the coming quarters and years? Thanks.\nAdam Schechter: Yes. No, thank you, Andrew. If you look at oncology, I mean, we really do have a very broad menu of oncology offerings. Whether it be the basic testing and routine testing that you need for oncologists or it be the more esoteric testing, whether it be liquid biopsy, solid tumors, we continue to have a very strong broad portfolio. When I think about oncology, I don\u2019t look at any one test as the answer for how we\u2019re doing. I look across all of the oncology business that we have. And if you look across our business, we\u2019re seeing that business grow faster than our underlying routine testing business. In general, esoteric testing is growing faster. And I think what you want to make sure of is that when you offer a very high esoteric oncology test, a physician has the ability to order all the other tests that they may want. And we can put yourself in a physician shoes and you say, do I want to go to multiple different ordering systems to order all the different tests that I might need for an oncology patient, or do I want to have one system and get one report with all the results on it versus getting multi reports across different systems. I think the advantage that we have over time is the full portfolio of oncology offerings. So what I look at is not only the individual offerings that we have, but how do we do across the entire portfolio, including routine tests that you would do from housing patients white blood cell counts and so forth. So overall, it\u2019s a very good franchise for us. I expect it to grow faster than the overall underlying rate of diagnostics, and it will continue to be an area of focus.\nAndrew Brackmann: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Caliendo: Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me. And I appreciate it. I just wanted to make clear up a couple of things that I have questions on. The 80 basis points margin that you called out for Diagnostics ex-weather and Invitae that\u2019s a fantastic number. Wasn\u2019t there also a negative impact from calendar and sort of payroll days and the like as well? Like would the margin have actually been better like-for-like?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, Kevin, when we gave the 80 basis point improvement, excluding we did include the days.\nKevin Caliendo: Okay.\nGlenn Eisenberg: So Invitae, weather and days combined for, call it, 210 basis point headwind. So we would have been up 80, but that\u2019s still absorbing, call it, 30 basis point impact from COVID as well. But that\u2019s why when we talk about the underlying improvement in our margins, we feel good about how the business is performing. We just have these headwinds that again next year, we\u2019ll totally turn to tailwinds.\nKevin Caliendo: Well, that was sort of my first follow-up, was fourth quarter we should have a little bit of this. And then next year, can you sort of quantify what the calendar, at least in the payroll might be like in terms of a positive? Is it a couple of days? Like how should we think about that?\nGlenn Eisenberg: So, the big impact this year was we had two days of unfavorable payroll. Next year, we\u2019ll have one day of favorable payroll.\nKevin Caliendo: Okay.\nGlenn Eisenberg: So, it will be a positive year-over-year in 2025.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And just one thing on Invitae I wanted to clarify. I understand that there is accretion. Is that in absolute dollars, meaning next year, if Invitae was just the stand-alone, it would actually be AOI-positive, or is the accretion just on a year-over-year basis versus the dilution that you\u2019re seeing in the third and fourth quarters? [Indiscernible] positive?\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, Kevin, when we say that Invitae will be accretive in 2025, that\u2019s on a stand-alone business funded fully burdened with the cost for the acquisition. So slightly accretive last year, where it dipped for the next year, where it\u2019s dilutive this year. When we talk about margins, similarly, we expect to have, obviously, positive margins, generating positive earnings. So, in the first half of the year, margins will still be, even though that they are positive, there\u2019ll still be a headwind to overall margins. They\u2019re not back up to Diagnostics margins in the first half. But then once we get into the second half of the year, they\u2019ll start to be positive for Diagnostics year-over-year, because we\u2019ll be comping to negative margins where now they\u2019re positive margins, but accretive to earnings in absolute terms.\nKevin Caliendo: Perfect. That\u2019s great. And one last quick one. LaunchPad versus inflationary pressures. I know there was a period of time when LaunchPad wasn\u2019t necessarily able to keep up. Was it able to keep up in 3Q? Do you anticipate LaunchPad hitting its targets being at least being able to offset the wage and inflationary pressures?\nGlenn Eisenberg: We\u2019ve actually been tracking pretty good. That $100 million to $125 million of your of LaunchPad savings is comparable to kind of a little bit over 3%, call it, merit increase. This year, again, personnel costs were higher in part because of the days. But when you take out days, you just focus on the merit LaunchPad does track and help offset those costs.\nKevin Caliendo: Guys thanks so much. Super helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I have a question about your consumer business. Obviously, that continues to show some nice momentum. Can you talk about sort of your expectations for that as we sort of round out this part of the year and sort of where we should think about out from sort of a margin contribution perspective?\nAdam Schechter: Yes, so if you look at our consumer business, I\u2019ll focus on Labcorp OnDemand. We continue to add testing options on the OnDemand system. So we announced two new ones in the quarter, Luteinizing Hormone as well as Syphilis, and we launched a couple of tests last quarter, and we\u2019re going to continue to look for a new test to bring into that platform. We don\u2019t break out the revenue for OnDemand because it\u2019s still not of a material amount that makes sense for us to break out. But the growth rate of that business is pretty substantial. And if it does reach a point or when it does reach a point where we think it\u2019s worthwhile to model and to provide for your models, we\u2019ll break it out at that time. But we\u2019re going to continue to add test. It continues to grow well. It\u2019s just not a critical mass yet.\nElizabeth Anderson: Okay. And then just from a margin perspective, is that \u2013 is it sort of \u2013 like how do we think about those margins like vis-a-vis the corporate average? I know, as you said, it\u2019s still small, but just think content.\nGlenn Eisenberg: And again, it\u2019s kind of like that, Elizabeth. Given the size of it relative to the big business we have, it doesn\u2019t round really on the margins. Obviously, we\u2019re making investments in that part of the business that will help fuel the growth, but you won\u2019t really see the impact on the margin.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning Eric. Eric?\nOperator: Eric your line is open. If you are muted please un-mute.\nEric Coldwell: Can you hear me now?\nOperator: We can hear you now.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning Eric.\nEric Coldwell: Hey, good morning guys. Sorry about that. So if you\u2019ll allow me to squeeze in two quick ones. First, just Street is a little bit focused on your relationship with Walgreens. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve mentioned that on this call, but obviously, Walgreens is closing a number of stores over the next few years. And I think you have about 400 million units in those stores today. So just any comments on that and where that relationship is? And then second, on the employer testing-related business, I know you\u2019ve been reluctant to really highlight some of these \u201cnitpicky\u201d things that are smaller. But that\u2019s obviously been a headwind, and I think masking some have been better growth, but when will those comps possibly normalize? When do think you get to more of a basal rate in the employer testing facing businesses? And might that also be a favorable comp for 2025.\nAdam Schechter: Okay. So let me start with the Walgreens question first. I mean we continue to have a good relationship with Walgreens. We started the relationship back in 2017, and it continues to be a very good discussion between our teams. Obviously, they\u2019re making some strategic decisions. The good news for us is that we\u2019ve increased our capabilities at our stand-alone service centers. So, if you look at the technology we\u2019ve added, the ability for people to check in ability for people to check in remotely. We\u2019ve done a lot. So, the NPS scores of our standalone PSCs have actually increased over time and they continue to increase. So at this point, we do have about 400 PSCs, service centers in Walgreens. We expect that many of those, if not all of those, will continue as we make their decisions. If we have to stand up so stand-alone PSCs, it\u2019s not a problem for us to do it. We know how to do it. We do that all the time. We forgot employer testing. For us, it\u2019s still a relatively small part of our business. We do continue to see strain in that business and the comps are still difficult, but it\u2019s so small. It\u2019s not worth for us to break it out. In terms of overlapping, it\u2019s hard to say. It\u2019s hard to say what the bottom could be, to be honest. But I don\u2019t think it will add much positive or negative as we think about 2025.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Yes, I\u2019d agree that it\u2019s definitely, when you think about the strength of our organic demand and volume this year, that\u2019s with the headwind of Employer Services. So again, it speaks to, it\u2019s not a big headwind, but similarly as we go next year, even though we would hope and expect to see improvement or you\u2019re not going to see a big tailwind from that as well.\nEric Coldwell: I\u2019m not overly worried about the Walgreens situation. But if I could just ask, would it not make sense that perhaps you\u2019re in some of their better and higher traffic stores, i.e., those less likely to be facing closures?\nAdam Schechter: So, when we work with them to the size of the stores that we choose, we do choose stores that are mutually beneficial to them and to us. So, areas where they see a lot of volume stores where they know that if they have a service internet, they\u2019ll get more volume in a high-volume store. So, when we first choose those and chose the 400, we were very deliberate. We worked very closely with them to strategically choose those stores. That\u2019s why I feel pretty good about where we are with them.\nGlenn Eisenberg: And also, Eric, from that, to the extent it would be \u2013 a store would be impacted where we would have a patient service center we\u2019ll have the opportunity to find another store with them to go into that we\u2019re not that could be in close proximity or we\u2019ll also have the option of just setting up a patient service center in that location that would be outside of where they are. But to your point, we\u2019re not expecting many to be impacted, but frankly, we just don\u2019t know yet. And once we do, we\u2019ll adapt from it.\nEric Coldwell: Perfect. Well thanks for being a ray of sunshine in a tough healthcare services world. Good job.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Stephanie.\nStephanie Davis: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question guys. I was hoping we could dig into BLS again. There has been some noise in the market around pricing with some of your peers. So. I was hoping just given the upside you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in pricing, maybe why it differentiates. And any further color you can give around some of the metrics around orders and cancellations? Thank you.\nAdam Schechter: Sure. So, let me start with the second question first. So, if you look at our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is a 1.02. That\u2019s with the quarter being at 0.96. So, we had a relatively easy compare versus the same quarter last year. The book-to-bill remains healthy for both businesses. We have good, consistent win rates, we have solid orders across the businesses, so I feel good as I look into the future for those businesses. The thing I would say is the quarterly book-to-bill changes. So, it was an easy compare this quarter versus last quarter. In fourth quarter, we expect to have sequential growth versus this quarter in dollars and also in terms of the book-to-bill for the quarter, but it can be a very rough comparator versus fourth quarter of last year. Then if you look at the first quarter of this year versus 2025, it will be a much easier comparison. So, what I would say is, overall, the book-to-bill remains healthy, but you do see fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, and that\u2019s going to continue for the next couple of quarters and moving forward. With regard to pricing, I\u2019ll start with our early development business. In general, when capacity is not fully utilized, you see some pricing pressure. We see some pricing pressure. But at the same time, because the price of NHPs have come down pretty significantly, and the NHP prices don\u2019t impact us because it was just a pass-through for us, our customers are seeing a price decrease just based upon the cost of the NHPs, which I think helps us with some of the pressures that they\u2019re feeling. And in Central Laboratories, we continue to have some longer-term contracts over time, we have lots of long-term agreements. So, there is always going to be pricing pressure there. We\u2019re going to always look for ways to discuss as we face those pressures. But overall, net-net, the momentum in Central Lab is very strong and we expect the early development business to be back to growth next quarter.\nStephanie Davis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Hey, good morning. This is John Kim for Michael. So, Invitae seems to be progressing well. So looking ahead, you talked about the M&A contribution to still be 1.5% to 2.5% here. Where will your priorities lie, is there perhaps like any geographical exposure that you would want to increase?\nAdam Schechter: Hi, John. What I would say is we continue to have a very deep business development pipeline. Vast, vast majority of it is in hospital and health systems, local and regional laboratories. And that\u2019s where our focus is when it comes to deals. We\u2019re looking for things that are accretive in the first year, return our cost of capital in two or three years that we know how to integrate really, really well. What I\u2019d say is something like Invitae is not typical. We don\u2019t typically do a deal that would be dilutive in the first year. Those are not the types of deals that we would typically be interested in. If it\u2019s strategically aligned and a one-off we\u2019ll consider it. But in general, what we\u2019re really looking for are those hospital regional, local laboratories.\nJohn Kim: Got it, understood. And then also great to hear that the LaunchPad savings are on track to offset the wage inflation, but wanted to ask how the frontline work over to an over rate has been like.\nGlenn Eisenberg: Again, the LaunchPad is being very effective in helping offset the wage rate. We have seen improved, call it, attrition, especially within our biopharma side, kind of back to normal levels of pre-pandemic. We\u2019ve seen nice progress within the Diagnostics side of our business. But to your point, in select areas, especially the frontline workers, it is more competitive. They have a lot of other choices to try to find higher hourly rates at different industry even not necessarily just what we do here. So, we continue to work hard on making it a good inclusive experience. We are focused on our teams. Obviously, the longer we keep people working for us, the more loyalty and the more likely they stay. So, overall, it\u2019s being managed. It is part of the overall increase in the labor environment costs, but we continue to make progress on it.\nJohn Kim: Got it. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAdam Schechter: Good morning, Brian.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Megan [ph] on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question at the end here. Can you guys just speak to your M&A pipeline? You guys obviously had a lot of deals over the last year. We\u2019d like to just know kind of if you have any visibility on what that\u2019s going to look like in 2025.\nAdam Schechter: Yes, hi, Megan. So, we continue to be very optimistic about our pipeline of deals, particularly in a hospital local regional laboratory businesses. And if you look at what we\u2019ve said that\u2019s going to happen in our longer-term outlook, we\u2019ve actually increased the revenue growth that\u2019s going to come from the acquisition strategy that we have. So, we expect historically, the inorganic growth to be 1% to 2%. We\u2019ve actually raised that in our longer-term guidance where it\u2019s now going to be 1.5% to 2.5%. Historically, it was 1% to 2%, now it\u2019s 1.5% to 2.5%. I think that just shows our confidence in the pipeline of deals that we have. It\u2019s impossible to predict the exact timing. So, I look forward to talking about those in the future.\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Adam Schechter for closing remarks.\nAdam Schechter: Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. And I hope you see we continue to advance our mission to improve health and improve lives, and we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results as we get into the year. I look forward to seeing you all soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter financial performance and progress against our strategy. Before discussing our results, we'd like to acknowledge the communities across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, including our home state of North Carolina, which continues to face the devastating effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Our thoughts are with those impacted, including our employees and residents of those communities across several states, who are grappling with a long recovery ahead. We continue to support relief and recovery efforts as a member of the American Red Cross Disaster Response program. Turning to our results for the quarter. We continue to perform very well across both diagnostics labratories and biopharma laboratory services. Our results reflect strong growth in diagnostics and central laboratories, driven by strong volume and core performance and by advancements in science, technology and innovation. Let's start by reviewing our financial results. Revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Diagnostics continued to deliver strong revenue growth, up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5%, while biopharma laboratory services revenue grew approximately 3%, driven by strong growth in central labs of 9%, partially offset by the expected decline of 11% in early development. We continue to expect early development to show year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the book-to-bill to grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter, but it's overlapping with a very strong fourth quarter last year. Overall, the book-to-bill remains healthy for continued growth. Adjusted EPS of $3.50 was up 4% year-over-year. Enterprise margins were down 40 basis points due to the impacts renminbi has. We expect to finish the year with solid growth across both diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services. Glenn will provide more details on our results in just a moment. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities by being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories by harnessing science and innovation to expand our leadership in important therapeutic areas and by utilizing data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers. In the third quarter, Labcorp continued to advance in these strategic growth areas. First, we maintained a leadership position as a partner of choice for health systems. During the third quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire select operating assets of Ballad Health outreach lab services. Ballad Health expands our comprehensive laboratory and testing capabilities to rural communities in Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky. We also entered into a strategic collaboration with Naples Comprehensive Healthcare in Southwest Florida to manage the daily operations of its inpatient laboratory operations. Turning to regional and local laboratories. We signed a new agreement to acquire select assets of Lab Works, an independent clinical laboratory located in Alabama. And we closed the previously announced acquisition of select assets of BioReference's Health laboratory testing business. We continue to have a strong business development pipeline, and we look forward to sharing more of those details in the future. We also made several notable advances in science, technology and innovation in the quarter through strategic acquisitions, investments and new product launches. First, we completed the acquisition of select assets of Invitae during the quarter. Performance was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect it to be slightly accretive to earnings for 2025 with top line growth of approximately 10%. We are excited about Invitae's complementary cutting edge science, their genetic testing solutions and technology, which aligns strategically with Labcorp's focus on specialty medicine and oncology. The acquisition extends our leadership in specialty testing capabilities and our ability to utilize genetic data to improve clinical trials and treatment regimens in oncology and select rare diseases. By integrating Invitae's genetic testing technology with Labcorp's specialty testing capabilities, we can offer a more complete set of insights for each patient from testing to diagnosis to treatment. The integration is on track with our financial goals without impacting the great science and customer experience that Invitae provides today. In July, we announced an expanded collaboration with Ultima Genomics to utilize its sequencing solution and technology to explore new whole genome sequencing clinical applications, including MRD in patients with early-stage solid tumor cancers. In August, Labcorp received de novo marketing authorization from the FDA for our PGDx elio plasma focus Dx, the industry's only kitted, pan-solid tumor liquid biopsy test. This test enables laboratory to perform genomic profiling when tissue is limited or unavailable. Labcorp has an industry-leading comprehensive oncology testing menu, and we are uniquely positioned as the only company offering FDA-authorized kitted solutions for both tissue and liquid-based solid tumor testing. We also continue to expand our Labcorp OnDemand offerings with additional consumer-initiated tests in July and August, including Syphilis and Luteinizing Hormone tests. Subsequent to the quarter end, we announced an exclusive agreement with NowDiagnostics to distribute the first over-the-counter, point-of-care Syphilis blood test granted marketing authorization by the FDA. We plan to make the test available to providers by the end of 2024 and directly to patients through Labcorp OnDemand in 2025. In the quarter, we also made improvements to our customer experience, using data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers. We introduced a new order tracking experience to our diagnostic customers, giving the majority of providers' real-time visibility of test order status. This new capability offers comprehensive sample tracking enhancing providers' ability to manage patient care effectively with clear up-to-date information on all test orders. Ovia Health by Labcorp announced the expansion of its women health solutions to include a personalized, comprehensive postpartum experience. This 12-month program is designed to help women manage multiple aspects of the postpartum period through personalized recovery modes, symptom tracking and alerts and mental health support. I am proud of our accomplishments and how we operate as an organization. We recently earned Ethisphere's Compliance Leader Verification, which recognizes organizations with an outstanding commitment to achieving a best-in-class ethics and compliance program. Ethics and integrity are at the heart of everything we do, and integral to our mission to improve health and improve lives. We were also proud to be named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion after earning the top score of 100 by the 2024 Disability Equality Index. In the quarter, Congress delayed the implementation of PAMA, removing a potential $80 million revenue headwind in 2025. While we are pleased with this further delay, we continue to work closely with our trade associations to seek a permanent fix to PAMA as there is bipartisan recognition that long-term reform is needed. In conclusion, we continue to execute well on our short-term financial commitments while also making progress on our longer-term strategy. I am confident in our growth opportunities and we remain on track to achieve our longer term outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Good morning, Ann. Sure. I'll start with 2025. And so first of all, I feel great about the momentum that we have in both our diagnostics and central laboratory business, and we expect early development is going to grow in the fourth quarter and will grow as we go into 2025. We're not giving any 2025 guidance today. But as you look at our longer-term guidance, where we have organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5%, plus another 1.5% to 2.5% growth for inorganic growth, we remain on track, and we're going to be entering 2025 with real momentum and strength. As I think about the central laboratory business, it continues to perform very well. Central laboratory had very strong growth year-over-year of 9%. I would say that, that's based off of an easy compare last year because as you recall last year, there was a lot of sites that didn't have the ability to enroll patients. They have staffing issues and so forth. But as we look forward into the future and I look at the longer-term guidance for BLS, I expect central labs will be consistent with that guidance and show continued growth. If you look at the central lab books, we have solid orders, we have good, consistent win rates and we are a leader in that field. And in that field, the majority of our business is with larger pharma. It's much less with the smaller biotechnology companies. Good morning, Lisa. Yes. So let me start first with Invitae. So we continue to be really excited about their science, their genetic testing solutions and technology that they have and it really aligns with us strategically. The integration is going extremely well. We're on track with all the integration metrics that we have in place. If you look at the financial metrics, we're performing as we expected based upon what we provided guidance last quarter. And as you look at this year, we expect that there'll be an impact of about 40 basis points negative, but as we go into next year we expect Invitae to be slightly accretive. So you can assume if it's negative in the first two quarters of the launch, and it's slightly accretive for the full year that it will take us a little bit of time as we go through the year before you see that accretion occur. But overall, we remain very bullish about that acquisition and the revenue growth will be about 10% as we think about next year as well. And then in terms of mix, I'll ask Glenn to provide some comments. Good morning, Michael. And the only thing I would add to that is when we talk about LaunchPad, it really is continuous improvement. And we know as we go into the future, we're going to have to continually find ways to reduce costs to improve margins. And I think with all the work that we're doing with technology, with some of the work that we're doing with artificial intelligence, we see other opportunities now above and beyond what we've talked about in the past to continue to find ways to reduce costs moving forward. So that's just something that's built into our DNA as a company, and we're going to continue to find ways to reduce costs where we can. Good morning, Patrick. Yes. Patrick, as you look at utilization rates, we certainly see acceleration in healthcare overall. And the question is with what hospitals have seen and other parts of healthcare, will that continue? I would expect at some point that will slow down a bit to more historic levels. But at the same time, with our business, I believe we're seeing share increases in particular as we do more of these hospital deals and the local regional laboratory deals. So when you look at our longer-term guidance for diagnostics, we expect organic revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. And then on top of that, inorganic, which we've actually increased our longer-term inorganic growth expectations, historically, it was 1% to 2%, now we have it at 1.5% to 2.5%. So when you look at those numbers, I would tell you that we expect continued strong momentum as we move forward with the business. Good morning, Erin. Yes, sure. No, we continue to feel very good about our managed care discussions and the contracts that we've negotiated. We're very confident that the renewals that we've secured are good terms. And if you look across everything we've done this year, we believe, as we move forward, net-net, we're neutral to slightly positive, which historically, that has not been the case. So, I feel great about the different managed care discussions that we've had this year. Our position as we go into 2025 is strong. I don't see any major contracts that I'm concerned about. So I think that the momentum will continue. Yes. So I'll give some comments and I'll ask for Glenn to jump in as well. If you look at our early development business, we certainly saw sequential positive growth in terms of revenue. We saw less of a decline in third quarter as a percent that we saw in second quarter. As we move into fourth quarter, we have good insight to the studies are underway. It's not like we have to get new studies to understand what fourth quarter is going to look like. Based upon what we see today, we expect that there will be growth in early development in the fourth quarter. Now to be fair, it's off of a relatively easy comparison versus fourth quarter of last year. And as we go into next year, and the book-to-bill continues to build, and the cancellations continue to hold, then we would expect to see growth as well, but also based upon an easier compare because this year, it continued to struggle for several quarters. So over time, we continue to have good expectations for that business. We are a leader in that field. I believe that the biotechnology companies with interest rates should continue to do well. And over time, that business has had some cyclical ups and downs, but over time, it's a very good business. Good morning, David. Yes. So again, without giving specific 2025 guidance today, which we'll give in February of next year, we have momentum. And you can feel the momentum you've seen over the past few quarters. Diagnostics business continues to perform well, both organically and inorganically, central laboratories performing well and ED will be back to growth. As I think about PAMA, we still have an impact of PAMA in the longer-term guidance. And we just pushed it out a year. There is another year. So, if PAMA were to be pushed out again, obviously, that would have a positive impact on our longer-term guidance. But until such a point I am confident that there won't be an impact of PAMA in 2026. We continue to keep it in our longer-term guidance and model. We continue to watch the broader trends, the utilization rates the business development that we're doing and the trends remain strong. So, barring surprises, we remain confident as we look at the momentum we have. Good morning, Jack. And Jeff, with regard to the [indiscernible] market, and we've been competing in that market for quite some time. Invitae was an additional way for us to be a larger competitor in that market. So we know it well. We know how to compete in it. We know how to win in it. It's still early days, frankly, when you look at revenue, but so far so good. And our customers seem to be pleased to now have Labcorp testing capabilities available to them. We're continuing to work on the customer experience, so it could become much easier for the customers over time to order directly all the tests that they might want for a patient for women's health or for oncology. So I think over time, we're going to continue to do very well. The 10% growth that we expect in revenue is almost what the market is growing. So my hope is, over time, we'll be able to accelerate that. But in the meantime, we're basically saying we're going to grow at about the market rate. Good morning Pito. Yes. So Peter, as you look across all of our contracts that we negotiated as we went through this year, net-net I think, it looks really good. And in fact, it's going to be neutral to slightly positive for us. If you look at areas in general, I prefer nonexclusive contracts overall. And I've been saying that for five years now, because I think when you have exclusive contracts with managed organizations, it just leads to price erosion every three or four years. Whereas if you have open contracts, I think, you can compete in the marketplace, and we compete very well in the marketplace. And when exclusive contracts open up, typically the rate structures change as well. So, there's not significant downside in many ways in that case also. So I feel very good about our managed care position, I feel very good about the momentum that we have in managed care as we go into next year. Hi. Yes. No, thank you, Andrew. If you look at oncology, I mean, we really do have a very broad menu of oncology offerings. Whether it be the basic testing and routine testing that you need for oncologists or it be the more esoteric testing, whether it be liquid biopsy, solid tumors, we continue to have a very strong broad portfolio. When I think about oncology, I don't look at any one test as the answer for how we're doing. I look across all of the oncology business that we have. And if you look across our business, we're seeing that business grow faster than our underlying routine testing business. In general, esoteric testing is growing faster. And I think what you want to make sure of is that when you offer a very high esoteric oncology test, a physician has the ability to order all the other tests that they may want. And we can put yourself in a physician shoes and you say, do I want to go to multiple different ordering systems to order all the different tests that I might need for an oncology patient, or do I want to have one system and get one report with all the results on it versus getting multi reports across different systems. I think the advantage that we have over time is the full portfolio of oncology offerings. So what I look at is not only the individual offerings that we have, but how do we do across the entire portfolio, including routine tests that you would do from housing patients white blood cell counts and so forth. So overall, it's a very good franchise for us. I expect it to grow faster than the overall underlying rate of diagnostics, and it will continue to be an area of focus. Good morning, Kevin. Good morning, Elizabeth. Yes, so if you look at our consumer business, I'll focus on Labcorp OnDemand. We continue to add testing options on the OnDemand system. So we announced two new ones in the quarter, Luteinizing Hormone as well as Syphilis, and we launched a couple of tests last quarter, and we're going to continue to look for a new test to bring into that platform. We don't break out the revenue for OnDemand because it's still not of a material amount that makes sense for us to break out. But the growth rate of that business is pretty substantial. And if it does reach a point or when it does reach a point where we think it's worthwhile to model and to provide for your models, we'll break it out at that time. But we're going to continue to add test. It continues to grow well. It's just not a critical mass yet. Good morning Eric. Eric? Good morning Eric. Okay. So let me start with the Walgreens question first. I mean we continue to have a good relationship with Walgreens. We started the relationship back in 2017, and it continues to be a very good discussion between our teams. Obviously, they're making some strategic decisions. The good news for us is that we've increased our capabilities at our stand-alone service centers. So, if you look at the technology we've added, the ability for people to check in ability for people to check in remotely. We've done a lot. So, the NPS scores of our standalone PSCs have actually increased over time and they continue to increase. So at this point, we do have about 400 PSCs, service centers in Walgreens. We expect that many of those, if not all of those, will continue as we make their decisions. If we have to stand up so stand-alone PSCs, it's not a problem for us to do it. We know how to do it. We do that all the time. We forgot employer testing. For us, it's still a relatively small part of our business. We do continue to see strain in that business and the comps are still difficult, but it's so small. It's not worth for us to break it out. In terms of overlapping, it's hard to say. It's hard to say what the bottom could be, to be honest. But I don't think it will add much positive or negative as we think about 2025. So, when we work with them to the size of the stores that we choose, we do choose stores that are mutually beneficial to them and to us. So, areas where they see a lot of volume stores where they know that if they have a service internet, they'll get more volume in a high-volume store. So, when we first choose those and chose the 400, we were very deliberate. We worked very closely with them to strategically choose those stores. That's why I feel pretty good about where we are with them. Good morning, Stephanie. Sure. So, let me start with the second question first. So, if you look at our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is a 1.02. That's with the quarter being at 0.96. So, we had a relatively easy compare versus the same quarter last year. The book-to-bill remains healthy for both businesses. We have good, consistent win rates, we have solid orders across the businesses, so I feel good as I look into the future for those businesses. The thing I would say is the quarterly book-to-bill changes. So, it was an easy compare this quarter versus last quarter. In fourth quarter, we expect to have sequential growth versus this quarter in dollars and also in terms of the book-to-bill for the quarter, but it can be a very rough comparator versus fourth quarter of last year. Then if you look at the first quarter of this year versus 2025, it will be a much easier comparison. So, what I would say is, overall, the book-to-bill remains healthy, but you do see fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, and that's going to continue for the next couple of quarters and moving forward. With regard to pricing, I'll start with our early development business. In general, when capacity is not fully utilized, you see some pricing pressure. We see some pricing pressure. But at the same time, because the price of NHPs have come down pretty significantly, and the NHP prices don't impact us because it was just a pass-through for us, our customers are seeing a price decrease just based upon the cost of the NHPs, which I think helps us with some of the pressures that they're feeling. And in Central Laboratories, we continue to have some longer-term contracts over time, we have lots of long-term agreements. So, there is always going to be pricing pressure there. We're going to always look for ways to discuss as we face those pressures. But overall, net-net, the momentum in Central Lab is very strong and we expect the early development business to be back to growth next quarter. Hi, John. What I would say is we continue to have a very deep business development pipeline. Vast, vast majority of it is in hospital and health systems, local and regional laboratories. And that's where our focus is when it comes to deals. We're looking for things that are accretive in the first year, return our cost of capital in two or three years that we know how to integrate really, really well. What I'd say is something like Invitae is not typical. We don't typically do a deal that would be dilutive in the first year. Those are not the types of deals that we would typically be interested in. If it's strategically aligned and a one-off we'll consider it. But in general, what we're really looking for are those hospital regional, local laboratories. Good morning, Brian. Yes, hi, Megan. So, we continue to be very optimistic about our pipeline of deals, particularly in a hospital local regional laboratory businesses. And if you look at what we've said that's going to happen in our longer-term outlook, we've actually increased the revenue growth that's going to come from the acquisition strategy that we have. So, we expect historically, the inorganic growth to be 1% to 2%. We've actually raised that in our longer-term guidance where it's now going to be 1.5% to 2.5%. Historically, it was 1% to 2%, now it's 1.5% to 2.5%. I think that just shows our confidence in the pipeline of deals that we have. It's impossible to predict the exact timing. So, I look forward to talking about those in the future. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. And I hope you see we continue to advance our mission to improve health and improve lives, and we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results as we get into the year. I look forward to seeing you all soon. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions. The base business grew 8% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 4.8%. Operating income for the quarter was $254 million, or 7.7% of revenue, or 13.4% on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, we had $105 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $18 million of expense for the transition service agreements related to the spin-off Fortrea with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $64 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $441 million, or 13.4% of revenue, compared to $424 million, or 13.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs and the loss from Invitae. The 40 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin was due to Invitae. Excluding Invitae as well as the impact from weather and days, margins would have been up approximately 120 basis points. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% compared to 24% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $170 million or $2 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.50 in the quarter, up 4% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $277 million in the quarter, which included an expected use of cash from Invitae compared to $276 million a year ago. Capital expenditures totaled $116 million in the quarter, or 3.5% of revenue. This compares to $105 million, or 3.4% in the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $162 million. During the quarter, the company invested $458 million in acquisitions, paid down $61 million in dividends and repurchased $75 million of stock. At quarter end, we had $1.5 billion in cash, while debt was $6.8 billion. These higher balances are due to the prefunding of maturing debt. During the quarter, the company raised $2 billion of long-term notes to prefund $2 billion of maturing debt. The company expects to use cash to pay down the remaining $1.4 billion of debt, maturing over the next four months. Our current debt leverage is 2.4x net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year, with organic growth of 5% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 4%. The base business grew 9.8% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 5.8%. Total volume increased 5.1% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 5.6% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 2.7%, which was negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points from weather, while acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Price mix increased 3.8% versus last year due to organic base business growth and acquisitions that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price mix was up 3% compared to the base business last year due to mix as we benefited from lab management agreements, an increase in test per accession and esoteric testing growing faster than routine. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $387 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $386 million, or 16.5% last year. Adjusted operating margin was down 130 basis points due to Invitae and the unfavorable impacts of days and weather. Excluding these items, margins would have been up around 80 basis points as the benefit of organic demand and LaunchPad savings was partially offset by higher personnel costs. Now I'll review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $738 million, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 2% and foreign currency translation of 0.6%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in central labs, which was up 9%, while early development was down 11%, primarily due to higher-than-normal cancellations in prior periods. However, early development revenue increased sequentially from the second quarter, and we continue to expect it to grow year-over-year, beginning in the fourth quarter. Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $121 million, or 16.4% of revenue, compared to $109 million, or 15.2% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.1 billion, and we expect approximately $2.6 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.02. Now I'll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, including acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 6.6% to 7.3% compared to 2023. Versus prior guidance, the midpoint is unchanged as a benefit of 20 basis points from foreign currency is being offset by a negative 20 basis points from weather. We continue to perform well in diagnostics with revenue expected to be up 7.2% to 7.8% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 10 basis points due to the improved outlook within diagnostics. The acquisition of select assets of BioReference that was previously only included in the enterprise guidance until the transaction closed is benefiting diagnostics growth by 30 basis points. This is being offset by the unfavorable impact from weather of 30 basis points. We expect biopharma revenue to grow 4.7% to 5.6% compared to 2023. The midpoint of our guidance increased 80 basis points due to the favorable impact from foreign currency of 100 basis points, partially offset by a slower recovery in early development of 20 basis points. We continue to expect early development to grow revenue year-over-year beginning in the fourth quarter. We expect enterprise margins to be slightly down year-over-year with diagnostics margins constrained by Invitae and weather. We expect biopharma margins to be up year-over-year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $14.70. We have decreased the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 due to the estimated impact from weather of $0.15. Our free cash flow guidance range is $850 million to $980 million. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends. Operator, we will now take questions. Yes. First, just also just wrapping up on the Invitae as well as Adam commented that yes, we would expect margin improvement sequentially going forward. So each quarter that we have as we integrate the business, it will improve will still show negative comps on margin year-on-year through the first half of next year just until it annualizes. And then Lisa, once it's annualized, you'd expect to see that margin improvement or be a tailwind to margins beginning in the second half of next year. With the price mix, we actually had a good top line growth within diagnostics overall. If you look at our base business organically, we grew around 6%, and that was pretty evenly split between utilization. Volume was up around 2.7%, and even that was constrained by weather of around 40 basis points. But to your earlier comment, the mix impact, we were up around 3%. And really, what drove that this quarter more than anything was the in-hospital lab management agreements, which we continue to do, and we treat that as price mix, but we've also seen a steady increase in our test per session, which we've seen over time that continues to progress and we continue to see growth in more of our esoteric business growing faster than our routine. So really, the combination of those three things is what drove the favorable mix this quarter. Yes. So Michael, I'll take a first cut of it and Adam may want to add as well. But we actually do feel very good about the underlying performance of the company. And to your point, we have a bunch of headwinds that we've identified that we call obviously, would be more nonoperational, the strategic acquisition that we did with Invitae, the impact of weather and this quarter and actually will also have a quarter impact in the fourth quarter from just days, so kind of timing related. And so that gets to that 120 basis point expansion that you commented about. But the underlying business, when we take those out and also we obviously still have a little bit of a headwind from COVID testing, that's now leveled off, but still year-over-year, it's a negative impact. But the underlying business, we're benefiting from the top line growth. We're benefiting from our LaunchPad initiatives. We're still on track to $100 million to $125 million of our LaunchPad savings. So as we think about operating leverage, ideally, we target kind of around a gross margin. When you kind of peel out those unusual items, if you will, or the headwinds that we had, we're operating in the high 20s, and frankly, a little stronger even in the third quarter. But we're kind of in the ballpark of our gross margins. So we think underlying our business where we need to be. What's interesting as well is a lot of the headwinds that we're having this year in 2024 will become tailwinds to our margins next year. So we still expect our underlying performance to be good. But then when you think about Invitae, when you think about days, obviously, if we would have normal weather, all those three headwinds that we had this year will become tailwinds to margins next year. Yes. The only thing I'd add is as you think about even just the segment, the implied guide for the fourth quarter is revenue growth of call it, 9.5%. So obviously, a lot stronger, around six points higher than what we had for the first nine months. Currency is around two points of that. But the underlying 4% really the strong improvement is being driven off of early development. You would have seen that on a, call it, the nine months, we're down around 11% in early development business, but we expect positive year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. And as Adam said, we have a soft comp in the fourth quarter. But more importantly, we saw sequential growth in ED in the third quarter from the second. We expect to see sequential growth again in the fourth quarter. Obviously, given the time of the year with the fourth quarter, we're effectively now executing on our backlog where this is in the business a little bit more difficult to forecast because of the short nature of the studies. So, you count on the new business coming in to turn into revenues in the same quarter. So, we feel pretty good about the outlook, the growth. And as Adam said, the long term for biopharma, we're looking kind of at the midpoint of our growth rate of 6%. So, we're already there and doing well within Central Lab. ED, obviously, is now going to be positive, and you would expect given the lower comp, there to be even a little bit higher growth rates over the next couple of years coming from ED, including from the margins. Again, one of the benefits of the tailwinds as we think about 2025 just with that top line growth we'll also get positive margin improvement there as well. Yes. No, I would agree. The other thing, as you look at normally the upside on ranges in the downside, obviously, is demand driven to get to the upside or maybe some unforeseen headwinds. And as Adam said, where we sit today and is, again, we'll comment more about 2025, which would be the second year into our long-term ranges, if you will. We feel's very good about the ranges just even from a just general profile of kind of that mid-single-digit top line growth organically, margin improvement, capital allocation that will help fuel top line growth through acquisitions as well as strong cash for free cash flow to get to a double-digit earnings per share kind of growth profile. So, we feel very good. And even with some of the headwinds, tailwinds, as Adam said, we got the benefit from PAMA being delayed, but still within the range from a margin profile and revenue. And the flip side is on Invitae, a strategic deal we did, but that would be call it, dilutive to the margins, if you will, relative to our general profile that we would put in there. So overall, net-net, we feel pretty good about the ranges that we have. Yes, I'll take the Jack, the first one on Invitae. And Adam, I think, mentioned it in his opening comments, we're pretty much in line with expectations. So, we originally said that for the year, we pick up around 120-ish of revenues, and it would be weighted kind of 50% and 70% between the third and the fourth. So your number for the third is in line with what our expectation is. But across the board for Invitae, we feel very good about the integration that's going on, what was expected and continue to drive to get that to be obviously positive from an earnings and a margin standpoint next year. Yes, Jack, I think on our last call, when we knew we were going through the financings at that time, we kind of talked just in line of around $210 million of interest expense for this year, growing to $240 million. We did all of our financings, we actually feel good about where we came out. We raised the $2 billion of debt. We actually had an order book of over $8.5 billion. So, we were able to get tighter pricing, and we hit the market at a good time. So directionally, I assume that we're coming in a little bit better on the interest expense this year. And therefore, and next, obviously, the bulk of it will be annualized for next year, but the year-over-year change should be comparable, but the overall \u2013 the absolute number should be a little bit favorable to what we shared before. Yes. No, Kevin, when we gave the 80 basis point improvement, excluding we did include the days. So Invitae, weather and days combined for, call it, 210 basis point headwind. So we would have been up 80, but that's still absorbing, call it, 30 basis point impact from COVID as well. But that's why when we talk about the underlying improvement in our margins, we feel good about how the business is performing. We just have these headwinds that again next year, we'll totally turn to tailwinds. So, the big impact this year was we had two days of unfavorable payroll. Next year, we'll have one day of favorable payroll. So, it will be a positive year-over-year in 2025. Yes. No, Kevin, when we say that Invitae will be accretive in 2025, that's on a stand-alone business funded fully burdened with the cost for the acquisition. So slightly accretive last year, where it dipped for the next year, where it's dilutive this year. When we talk about margins, similarly, we expect to have, obviously, positive margins, generating positive earnings. So, in the first half of the year, margins will still be, even though that they are positive, there'll still be a headwind to overall margins. They're not back up to Diagnostics margins in the first half. But then once we get into the second half of the year, they'll start to be positive for Diagnostics year-over-year, because we'll be comping to negative margins where now they're positive margins, but accretive to earnings in absolute terms. We've actually been tracking pretty good. That $100 million to $125 million of your of LaunchPad savings is comparable to kind of a little bit over 3%, call it, merit increase. This year, again, personnel costs were higher in part because of the days. But when you take out days, you just focus on the merit LaunchPad does track and help offset those costs. And again, it's kind of like that, Elizabeth. Given the size of it relative to the big business we have, it doesn't round really on the margins. Obviously, we're making investments in that part of the business that will help fuel the growth, but you won't really see the impact on the margin. Yes. Yes, I'd agree that it's definitely, when you think about the strength of our organic demand and volume this year, that's with the headwind of Employer Services. So again, it speaks to, it's not a big headwind, but similarly as we go next year, even though we would hope and expect to see improvement or you're not going to see a big tailwind from that as well. And also, Eric, from that, to the extent it would be \u2013 a store would be impacted where we would have a patient service center we'll have the opportunity to find another store with them to go into that we're not that could be in close proximity or we'll also have the option of just setting up a patient service center in that location that would be outside of where they are. But to your point, we're not expecting many to be impacted, but frankly, we just don't know yet. And once we do, we'll adapt from it. Again, the LaunchPad is being very effective in helping offset the wage rate. We have seen improved, call it, attrition, especially within our biopharma side, kind of back to normal levels of pre-pandemic. We've seen nice progress within the Diagnostics side of our business. But to your point, in select areas, especially the frontline workers, it is more competitive. They have a lot of other choices to try to find higher hourly rates at different industry even not necessarily just what we do here. So, we continue to work hard on making it a good inclusive experience. We are focused on our teams. Obviously, the longer we keep people working for us, the more loyalty and the more likely they stay. So, overall, it's being managed. It is part of the overall increase in the labor environment costs, but we continue to make progress on it."

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christin O\u2019Donnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristin O\u2019Donnell : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp\u2019s Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures both of which are discussed during today\u2019s call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2024 guidance and the related assumptions, the spin-off of Fortrea Holdings, Inc., the impact of various factors on the company\u2019s businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition including the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings, benefits and synergies from the LaunchPad initiative and from acquisitions and other strategic transactions and partnerships, the completed holding company reorganization and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\nAdam Schechter : Thank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s really a pleasure to be here with you today. We look forward to sharing our strong results for the quarter, our updated 2024 outlook and progress on our strategy. Let\u2019s turn now to our financial results. In the second quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.94 and free cash flow from continuing operations was $433 million. Enterprise revenue increased 6% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Diagnostics revenue was up 8%, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. Central Laboratories growth was strong at 9%, partially offset by a decline in early development of 15%, resulting in biopharma laboratory services up 1%. The book-to-bill for early development was strong, with higher orders and lower cancellations, and we expect the business to be back to growth towards the end of the year. Adjusted EPS were up 15% and enterprise margins were up slightly. Margins in biopharma increased, while margins in Diagnostics were flat which reflects the impact of a cyber event that affected a large partner. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities through the following: Being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories, harnessing science and innovation to develop and launch new tests in important therapeutic areas, and by utilizing data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers. We are confident in the success of Labcorp in the months and quarters ahead with strong growth in diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services. Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 outlook in just a moment. The 2024 outlook reflects the anticipated close of Invite next week. In the second quarter, Labcorp continued to advance in our strategic growth areas. First, we continue to maintain a leadership position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. Following the quarter end, Labcorp entered into a comprehensive strategic collaboration with Naples Comprehensive Healthcare located in Florida to manage its inpatient lab operations and to serve as the primary lab later this summer. We\u2019re also on track to close the previously announced acquisition of select assets of BioReference Health Diagnostics business by the end of the third quarter. We continue to have a very strong business development pipeline, and we look forward to sharing more of those details in the future. We also announced the acquisition of select assets of Invitae, a leading medical genetics company. We\u2019re excited about Invitae\u2019s complementary cutting-edge science genetic testing solutions and technology, which aligns strategically with our focus on specialty testing and oncology. Together, we will work with our customers to utilize genetic insights to develop new treatments and to deliver personalized care in oncology and in select rare diseases. Upon closing the transaction, we anticipate the first 12 months will provide revenue of $275 million to $300 million. And the first year will be dilutive by approximately 3%. We\u2019ve included $120 million of revenue in 2024 and the vast majority of dilution in 2024. We expect it to be accretive for 2025 and with top line growth of more than 10% per year. We have a very strong integration team in place with members from both Labcorp and Invitae. We will move quickly and thoughtfully to reduce costs without impacting the great science and the great customer experience that Invitae provides today. Also, we anticipate Invitae will benefit from the full scale and breadth of Labcorp\u2019s platform as a global leader in laboratory services. We have great respect for Invitae\u2019s capabilities and team, and we look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Labcorp. As we advance our growth strategy, we continue to make great strides and expanding our testing solutions. In April, Labcorp received FDA approval as the amenitarian-use device for its companion diagnostic to determine patient eligibility for treatment with Pfizer\u2019s gene therapy for hemophilia B. This is expected to expand Labcorp\u2019s leadership in [indiscernible] medicine and in gene therapy. We introduced the first trimester screening test to assess preeclampsia risk during pregnancy. It is the only test of its kind available in the United States available for order by physicians for their patients. including those with a low to average risk for preeclampsia or first-time pregnancies. Roughly 1 in 25 presidencies in the United States is affected by the condition. And with this test, Labcorp is the only lab that can detect preeclampsia risk across all trimesters of pregnancy. We announced several new strategic service offerings with our precision oncology portfolio. extending our leadership in oncology. Our comprehensive genomic profiling service, Labcorp Tissue Complete is now available through our laboratory network centers in Geneva and Shanghai to support global PINNACLE trials. We\u2019ve also added OmniSeq Insight circulating tumor DNA to a portfolio of comprehensive genomic profiling services. Together, these solutions support customers as they advance of therapeutic development programs. Lastly, we continue to expand Labcorp on-demand our consumer-initiated testing offering with the launch of several new tests in May and June, including standard drug, complete drug comprehensive testosterone, HIV and complete heart health. We also continue to focus on creating easy-to-use digital technology signutions for our customers. In the quarter, we launched a suite of solutions referred to as Global Trial Connect, aimed at increasing the speed and efficiency of clinical trials. This solution differentiates Labcorp in the market and has been well received by our customers. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our team of more than 65,000 employees around the world. Together, we are focused on our customers achieving our financial commitments and making meaningful progress on our strategy, we have strong momentum and significant growth opportunities ahead of us. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Thank you, Adam. I\u2019m going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we\u2019ve also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing and foreign exchange. The base business grew 6.9% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 4.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $295 million or 9.2% of revenue or 14.9% on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, we had $100 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $23 million of expense for the transition service agreements related to the spin of Fortrea with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $62 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $480 million or 14.9% of revenue. compared to $448 million or 14.8% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was due to the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings that were partially offset by higher personnel expenses. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 23.9% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and additional R&D tax credits. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $206 million or $2.43 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.94 in the quarter, up 15% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $561 million in the quarter compared to $162 million a year ago. The increase in cash flow was due to cash earnings and working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $128 million in the quarter or 4% of revenue. This compares to $103 million or 3.4% in the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $433 million. During the quarter, the company invested $34 million in acquisitions, paid out $60 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of stock. The Board of Directors has approved an increase in its share repurchase authorization by $1 billion to a total of $1.4 billion. At quarter end, we had $265 million in cash, while debt was $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.4x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We have $2 billion of debt maturing over the next 12 months, and we expect to refinance it later this year. Now I\u2019ll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year, with organic growth of 4.7% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 3.2% and partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The base business grew 8.9% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 5.7%. Total volume increased 5.7% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 6.3% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 3.5% while acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Price mix increased 2.1% versus last year due to an organic base business increase that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price/mix was up 2.2% compared to the base business last year. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $442 million or 17.5% of revenue, compared to $410 million or 17.5% last year. Adjusted operating income was up due to organic demand, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Operating margins were flat but would have been up approximately 20 basis points, were it not for the impact of a cyber event that affected a large partner. Now I\u2019ll review the segment performance in biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $707 million, an increase of 1.1% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 1.2%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 9%, while early development was down 15% due to the higher than normal cancellations and lower orders in prior periods. However, we did see a sequential improvement in early development, gross orders and cancellations, which we expect will lead to higher revenues in the second half of the year and deliver year-over-year growth beginning in the fourth quarter. Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $107 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $105 million or 15% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.9 billion and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12 months book-to-bill held at 1.00 compared to last quarter and is expected to increase in the second half. Now I\u2019ll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. The acquisition of select assets of Invitae, which is expected to close next week, is now included in our guidance for 2024. For the remainder of the year, we expect Invitae to add approximately $120 million in revenue. lower adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.40 and reduced cash flow by approximately $150 million, primarily due to onetime costs related to retention, severance and integration as well as an increase in working capital. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 6.4% to 7.5% compared to 2023 versus prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint 135 basis points with Invitae contributing approximately 100 basis points of the growth. We continue to perform well in Diagnostics. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 6.9% to 7.9% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 200 basis points due to stronger base business demand and invite, which is expected to contribute around 130 basis points of the growth. We expect Biopharma revenue to grow 3.7% to 5% compared to 2023. The decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 35 basis points is due to early development, partially offset by continued strength in central labs. We expect early development to have a slower recovery than previously anticipated, but with year-over-year growth still expected to begin in the fourth quarter. We expect enterprise margins to be flat versus the prior year despite the negative impact from Invitae of approximately 40 basis points. Diagnostics margins are now expected to be down due to the inclusion of Invitae of approximately 60 basis points. We continue to expect margins in biopharma to be up year-over-year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $14.90. We have decreased the midpoint of guidance by $0.30, driven by the expected dilution from Invitae of approximately $0.40 and partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the underlying business. The free cash flow guidance range is now $850 million to $1 billion and includes approximately $150 million of a cash use from Invitae, which is primarily due to onetime costs. Excluding Invitae, the free cash flow guidance range is unchanged from prior guidance. In summary, LabCorp is well positioned for profitable growth, both organically as well as through acquisitions. We\u2019re excited about the acquisition of Invitae from both a strategic and financial perspective. Strategically, this strengthens our position in key long-term specialty testing growth areas of oncology and select rare diseases. From a financial perspective, while it\u2019s dilutive in 2024, we expect it to be accretive in 2025 and deliver a very attractive return on investment as we profitably grow the business. In addition, Labcorp continues to generate strong free cash flow that will be used for acquisitions while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners.\nMichael Cherny: I\u2019m going to ask 2 questions in one, just to make things easier. First, just can you give a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the new awards and early development and how you should think about at least from a category disease state perspective, where they should translate into the better growth in the back half of the year? And then just quickly on the Invitae accretion estimate for \u201825, I think that\u2019s a little faster than anticipated. Can you just give us some of the qualitative dynamics behind what you\u2019re doing to get that to be such a strong EPS contributor next year?\nAdam Schechter : Yes, sure. So first of all, if you look at the business in terms of biopharma laboratory services. We had very strong growth in our central laboratories of about 9%, and early development declined 15%. Both of those businesses are leaders in their respective markets. We believe we reached the trough for early development, and that\u2019s based upon the cancellations that we spoke about in the past. If you look at the book-to-bill for the quarter, it was strong, and it was strong for several reasons. Number one, because the orders were strong. But importantly, number two, because there were significantly less cancellations than what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. So that\u2019s what gives us the confidence for the improved performance that we expect in the early development as we go throughout the year. With regard to Invitae accretion in 2025, we said from the beginning that we were going to use calendar months because we didn\u2019t know the exact timing of closing. And we said it would be dilutive in the first 12 months and accretive in the second 12 months. It\u2019s closing a bit faster than we originally anticipated, which is good because we\u2019ll be able to move quicker. That\u2019s why you see a bit more dilution in 2024 than you may have anticipated, but that\u2019s also why it becomes accretive in 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair.\nAndrew Brackmann : Maybe just sticking on invite here for a minute. Adam, in your prepared remarks, I think you said that you expect it to benefit from your breadth and scale. So anything that you can share about customer or account overlap there, which sort of drives that confidence? Just trying to get a sense of that opportunity.\nAdam Schechter : Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s an exciting time, and we spent a lot of time with our colleagues that will be coming over for Invitae. And first and foremost, the sales organization is very excited. They\u2019re excited because they now have a broader portfolio of products. It\u2019s one thing to go into an office and talk about inherited cancers. It\u2019s another thing to say, but you can also test for all the other things that you may want to test that patient for. And ultimately, we\u2019re going to try to bring that all together so the physician can order directly through one tool and get whatever they need for the patients. So the sales organization is very excited about the breadth of what they\u2019ll bring into those customers. In addition to that, we have such strong partnerships that are abroad at LabCorp. We\u2019re hoping to be able to use those partnerships and have discussions with them about our new offering through Invitae. So although we\u2019ve not built in significant upside for the future with the new customers, we may be able to bring additional tests to. We believe that this market is going to grow significantly faster than other markets that we compete in, and we believe that there\u2019ll be more than 10% growth in this market versus other markets as we go forward. So we think it\u2019s a very exciting opportunity as we go forward. We\u2019re excited about welcoming our new colleagues. They\u2019re excited about being part of Labcorp, and we\u2019re going to move extraordinarily fast but thoughtful.\nAndrew Brackmann : Perfect. And then, Glenn, maybe 1 for you on the balance sheet. Thanks for the reminder on the $2 billion maturing here over the next 12 months. Anything that you can share as it relates to your expectations for the potential rate increases there or even any other alternatives that might be out there to potentially lower that increase?\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes, Andrew. Yes, it\u2019s our expectation that we will refinance all of the debt. We\u2019re not going to look to pay it down. We have around $1 billion of it due between now and the end of the year, starting actually in September and then $1 billion that\u2019s due in February. We expect to refinance all of that this year. Obviously, the markets have improved nicely. So we\u2019ll have that done. For modeling purposes, if you wanted to look at kind of the net interest expense line, we will refinance, obviously, at a light higher rate than what\u2019s maturing. Our net interest expense this year directionally will come in at around $210 million. And then obviously, once it\u2019s annualized for next year, that will tick up to maybe around $240 million. Again, we\u2019ll see ultimately when we go into the markets. But right now, the markets look pretty attractive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird.\nEric Coldwell : So 2 questions. First one is -- should be pretty quick here. Early development positive to hear about the order flow and the lower cancels, and I can see your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, if you\u2019re expecting growth, that one is pretty easy to get to. But I am curious what is the ramp of the phasing of the ramp from 2Q to 4Q? Is it split the difference between [ 213 ] plus in the fourth quarter and what you did here in the second quarter? Or is it more of a hockey stick into the fourth? Maybe just I don\u2019t know if you could parse out your revenue expectation between early development and Central Lab for the full year. That might be another way of doing this. And then I\u2019ll come back on my second.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Eric, it\u2019s Glenn. I\u2019ll take a first cut. But overall, again, we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned now within the biopharma group and Central Lab clearly has had a very strong first half, and we expect that to continue. What\u2019s interesting is the growth rate that we had in the first half benefited a little bit based upon the comp we had a year ago, given some softness in the investigator sites with some labor constraints but a solid first half, and we expect a more normalized growth rate within the Central Lab in the second half. The flip side is within ED, again, we are seeing a little bit of a slower recovery. But based upon in Adam\u2019s remarks with a stronger order book in the quarter with cancellations coming back down to more normal, we feel confident that we\u2019ll see sequential improvement in the revenues of ED in both the third and the fourth. So not kind of the hockey stick, but a continued progression but that in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll now start to see favorable comps year-on-year. So an improved outlook in the third, but still down year-on-year for ED, but in the fourth and improved revenues with positive comps.\nEric Coldwell : Okay. Great. And then just a quick one, I almost am reluctant to bring it up since you didn\u2019t bring it up, but your competitor had a bit of an update on the employer market, drug testing and being testing for employers. You did not call that out today, but I am curious if you could give any additional comments on your business, there may be a little bit of sizing data and what you\u2019re seeing in those respective markets on the employer side.\nAdam Schechter : Yes. So, we\u2019ve seen a decrease in employer side. But it\u2019s not that big or material to us, that was something we would call out. But there\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019re seeing as some employers haven\u2019t fully come back to work. They don\u2019t have the events that they used to have for wellness. Sometimes they\u2019re not doing the vaccinations that they used to do in office spaces. But it\u2019s less than 5% of our business. So it\u2019s not material to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson : I have 1 question about sort of each part of your business. But if we think about the beat in the quarter, it may be slightly different than some of your internal assumptions and you kind of flowed through the core non-Invitae EPS by $0.10 for the full year guidance. Can you talk about sort of the factors like maybe is there like a little bit of conservatism. Obviously, there\u2019s like the crowd striking stuff in the third quarter. So just sort of your confidence maybe on that versus the guidance raise. And then secondarily, obviously, nice to see the early development business improving. Can you comment on pricing in early development and any kind of shift you\u2019ve seen in that over the last quarter or so?\nAdam Schechter : Yes. Elizabeth, I\u2019ll take the second question first, and I\u2019ll ask Glenn to comment a bit about the first question. It\u2019s good to see the orders coming back and the cancellations being reduced in early development. That\u2019s what\u2019s giving us confidence in revenue growth as we go throughout the year. I would say the biggest difference in pricing that we\u2019ve seen is the price of the NHPs. They were much more expensive last year than they are this year. when the price went up, that was largely passed through to the customers. So we weren\u2019t making margin on that business. Now that the price is lower, it actually helps with the margin a bit, but that\u2019s the biggest difference.\nElizabeth Anderson: So the core -- sorry, go ahead.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Go ahead, Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Anderson: [Indiscernible] the core early development, pricing ex NHPs is sort of stable. Is that what you\u2019re saying? Just -- I just want to make sure I understood what you were saying.\nAdam Schechter : Yes, I would say it\u2019s relatively stable. I mean it\u2019s always under pressure. There\u2019s always pressure there. But I\u2019d say continued pressure relatively stable.\nGlenn Eisenberg : And then Elizabeth, on the first part. So when you look at, again, excluding Invitae, the underlying business, we\u2019ve increased the outlook at the top line. So overall, at the midpoint, we\u2019re up around 135 basis points, 100 of it from Invitae. So the underlying business is up, both upon the performance in the second quarter as well as an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. The growth, as we commented earlier, and the outlook improvement is an increase in our outlook for Diagnostics organically, for Central Labs organically and partially offset by a little lower outlook within the early development business. but the strength of the higher top line growth is obviously what\u2019s translating down to the bottom line, which causes us to have the underlying business, excluding Invitae, where we would have increased the midpoint of our EPS guidance range by $0.10.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan : So wanted to follow up on the Invitae deal. So with the transaction about to close, how are you feeling about integration and retention of the business? Obviously, they went bankrupt. So your revenue assumptions here are unchanged. I just wanted to hear your confidence around potential leakage that might have taken place over the last few months, just your views on that.\nAdam Schechter : Sure, Jack. First of all, when we first made the announcement, we very quickly put an integration team together of very competent, qualified people across all parts of Labcorp, and we match them with equally confident people across all parts of Invitae. So we\u2019ve had an integration team that has been working really hard to ensure that we have a very smooth transition. I feel very good about the work that they\u2019ve done. As we look at their monthly sales, they\u2019re relatively stable. And we feel good about the way in which they\u2019ve managed their business through what I would say, some pretty difficult turmoil. And their team has done, I think, an extraordinary job of trying to hang on to customers and hang on to business. So the question I\u2019m asking the integration team is where do we see upside? What else can we go after with the new portfolio that they\u2019ll have, the increased relationships and partnerships that we have. So I\u2019m actually less concerned about the leakage and I\u2019m more focused on where the growth opportunities are.\nJack Meehan: Awesome. And then I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but maybe for Glenn, just I was wondering if it was possible to call out the magnitude, the impact of the Ascension cyber event that took place during the quarter and just any issue related to crowd strike in July?\nGlenn Eisenberg : Jack, so on the -- our partner that had a cyber event, again, it did not affect Labcorp, but did affect our partner. We commented that it was around a 20 basis point headwind during the quarter from the margin of diagnostics. That\u2019s roughly around $5 million of, call it, operating income that would have been foregone. A little bit of some timing delay in cash as well that we\u2019ll get that just delayed from the second quarter to the third. But obviously, we had a very strong free cash flow number overall for the quarter in any event. We didn\u2019t comment on the CrowdStrike or frankly, even the hurricane impact in our results. Obviously, it happened after the second quarter. So when you think about the magnitude of those you\u2019re also looking probably around $0.05 a share impact to earnings. So when you look at the change in our guide other than Invitae, where we took the underlying business guide up $0.10 that\u2019s even after absorbing the impact from that IT outage event and the weather impact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.\nKevin Caliendo : The diagnostic revenue rec, the mix, the organic growth in general was better than we had modeled. And I\u2019m just Wondering if you can talk through if there\u2019s any changing dynamics or anything that was surprising there that if there\u2019s something happening in the market that\u2019s affecting mix in a positive way, or are you guys taking share? Or are you seeing volumes coming from a different place because they have been strong and the revenue rec was better. I just would love to understand what\u2019s actually happening in the marketplace there.\nAdam Schechter : Sure, Kevin. So if you look at the revenue was $2.5 billion for Diagnostics, and it increased by about 8%. You break down 8%, it was about 6% up from volume and price/mix was up about 2%. So as you stated, it was a very good, strong performance I think there\u2019s a couple of things that are driving it. First of all, it\u2019s -- the team has done a really good job executing in the marketplace. Number two, the hospital and local regional laboratory deals that we\u2019re doing, they\u2019re very good deals in themselves, but there is certainly some spillover that occurs in the geographies that are surrounding those areas. We are seeing continued strength in the number of tests per accession, which is helpful. And we continue to see a slight shift in mix when it comes to specialty testing or esoteric testing versus routine testing. And I think all those things together are giving us the uplift that we\u2019re seeing. And as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to see continued strength of about the same type of momentum.\nKevin Caliendo: Is this specialty test and the additional test per rec, is that a Labcorp\u2019s specific, like are you guys increasing your capabilities to be able to do that? Or is that something that\u2019s just happening in the marketplace, and that\u2019s the way the market is moving and you guys are benefiting from it?\nAdam Schechter : We\u2019ve talked about the importance of tests in 4 areas, specifically women\u2019s health, oncology, neurology and autoimmune disease. And we\u2019ve been really focused on launching new tests in those areas ensuring that we\u2019re having discussions with opinion leaders. We\u2019ve increased our scientific wherewithal in the marketplace in those areas. And those areas, the reason we\u2019re focused on is they grow faster than the other parts of diagnostic testing. Now when you run 650 million tests a year, even if you\u2019re seeing a shift in mix, it\u2019s hard to see that in market share. I mean, you can do the math on what the market share point is. But we\u2019re certainly starting to see some growth in the specialty areas. And I think it\u2019s partially due to the market, and it\u2019s also partially due to our focus.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes. Also, Kevin, just to kind of reinforce what Adam had said that when you look at the volume growth that we\u2019re now experiencing. And again, organically, our base business was up 3.5%. Obviously, it\u2019s higher than what our historical growth is, and we attribute that in part, as Adam said, to some of the sheer growth around the hospital outreach labs that we\u2019ve acquired as we penetrate those markets even stronger than maybe they had as well. But overall, when we look at the comps now to 2019, the CAGRs are stronger than historical averages. So where last year, we saw some of the improved growth rates, really more a function of a softer comp year-over-year, we actually think now we\u2019re comping to a more normal period a year ago and that the growth rates are now more sustainable. And as Adam said, as we give our guidance and what\u2019s implied is that we will continue to see -- we expect that strong level of both volume growth but also favorable mix along the lines that Adam had commented on.\nKevin Caliendo: That\u2019s helpful. Can I ask a quick follow-up to that. Does that -- the LaunchPad savings, you talked about are hitting targets. And one thing I think investors love to see with the higher organic growth is an expectation that like margins can expand. I\u2019m just wondering, is LaunchPad able to keep up with the other inflationary pressures around labor, wages churn, that kind of thing? And has that gotten better or worse, different? Any color around that would be super, super helpful.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes. No. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the LaunchPad activities. We talk about around $100 million to $125 million per year of savings. We comment that, that\u2019s what we look to do to help offset the inflationary expenses primarily related to personnel, which would fall within that, call it, $100 million to $125 million level. So we are able to offset that. We do normally expect to see good leverage on the incremental volume and revenues that we have. And obviously, you saw in the case of biopharma, good leverage on modest top line growth with margins that were up, benefiting from LaunchPad. And even within Diagnostics, while margins were flat during the quarter, we commented about the cyber event. We\u2019re still dealing with a little bit of a headwind from lower COVID as well. But as we think about the full year, the leverage, ideally, we\u2019d leverage at around a gross profit margin for the business that we\u2019re approaching that level for the full year when you take out the unusual items or the discrete items that could be a headwind. So that we think, as Adam commented earlier, the business is performing well from a top line standpoint and from an operational standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : Just quickly, can you maybe just comment on the LDT rule? It came out since you last reported, any impact? How are you thinking about that for your business? I understand that the industry overall is in some way disputing it, but I just want to hear your thoughts around it.\nAdam Schechter : Yes. Absolutely, Lisa. So continue to believe that the right path forward is to improvements and to enact the valid act, frankly. And that was legislation that was developed specifically for laboratory diagnostics, including LDTs. That had broad bipartisan support, and we think that\u2019s the right way forward. As you said, our trade organization, ACLA did file a lawsuit and they\u2019re challenging the FDA\u2019s final rule, and we\u2019re supportive of ACLA doing that. In the meantime, of course, we\u2019re going to be prepared to adhere to the LDT ruling. And when you look at the science, we do the vast majority of that science. I mean we submit all -- I mean, most if not all of our LDTs to New York state already. But at the same time, there are some things that we have to be prepared for in terms of monitoring and reporting requirements and so forth. And we have a team in place that ensure that we\u2019re ready for that to occur as soon as the LDT rule is final. At the same time, it\u2019s not going to have a significant impact to our revenue or to our expenses. I think the bigger impact is going to be to patients. And these LDTs are typically for people with rare diseases or smaller patient populations. And the question is, will the FDA even have the ability to approve these quick enough so that all patients have access to these important tests as quickly as possible. So to me, it\u2019s more of a patient access and important for patients than it is any type of impact to Labcorp, frankly.\nLisa Gill: Adam, just as I think about D.C., any updated thoughts from your side on either PAMA or SALSA or the opportunity for SALSA to primary pass?\nAdam Schechter : Yes. So we continue to strongly support the SALSA legislation. And I\u2019ve been saying this for, I think, 4 years now. And it has strong bipartisan support. And I\u2019ve been saying that for 4 years now. So it\u2019s kind of remarkable to me that it has not passed yet. And it continues to have strong support. We continue to be very supportive of it ourselves. But it\u2019s really hard to know if it will be passed again this year even though we\u2019re going to try to push for it to be passed. What I would say is that if it is not past this year, I do believe that there\u2019s a likelihood that will be delayed again. And if it\u2019s delayed again, that would be $80 million that we would not see as a downside next year, and a lot of that would fall to the bottom line. So let\u2019s wait to see how the year plays out. When we give guidance in February next year, we\u2019ll know what\u2019s happened and where we are. But in the meantime, we\u2019re going to continue to push to SALSA as best we can.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : So I\u2019m going to be really early with this question. But just as we head into 2025, excluding Invitae and some of the dynamics there, can you just point us to some of those key headwinds, tailwinds that you\u2019re thinking about or that we should be thinking about heading into 2025? And it sounds like you remain a little bit more confident on the underlying utilization trends and mix dynamics as we head into 2025? How sustainable those can be. And I guess I\u2019m mostly speaking to the Diagnostics segment, but I guess I\u2019ll throw on Biopharma as well, if there\u2019s anything to call out there?\nAdam Schechter : Yes. So what I\u2019d say, Erin, is that we\u2019re obviously not giving 2025 guidance today. But as I look at the trends, and I look at the things that I am considering as we go into 2025, the market dynamics continue to be strong. And what\u2019s interesting about the Diagnostics business in particular, is that regardless of Republican President, [ Democratic President], resessions, nonrecessions. The business is very durable and has shown its durability over time. So I feel very good about our Diagnostics business, the underlying performance. I would say the biggest headwind/tailwind is going to be what we just talked about, which is does PAMA occur or does it not occur. As I think about the Biopharma Laboratory businesses, we have momentum, we have strength I feel good about our orders and our order book as we go into the end of this year. And I expect that our book-to-bill is going to continue to improve even from where it is today, which is strong as we go through the rest of this year, and that would bode well as we go into 2025. And again, the biggest headwinds/tailwinds there is just what happens with the smaller biotech companies in the marketplace as well as pharma and what they decide to do based upon their environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.\nJohn Kim : This is John Kim on for Mike. Speaking of the small biotechs and pharmas has there been any improvement in the client mix -- or sorry, not improvement, but rather a shift in the client mix, I think you talked about targeting the midsized pharmas as well. And I guess is that why there is a confidence in that the early development business going further in the second half. I know you mentioned the cancellations have lowered, the bookings are improving, but also just interested to know if there\u2019s been any trend there?\nAdam Schechter : Yes. So if you look at the mix of business, it\u2019s a very different mix, if you look at the central laboratory business versus the early development business. And I\u2019m just going to give you some rough numbers. I assume it\u2019s about 70% larger pharma, large biotech in central laboratory and maybe 30% of the small biotech. And it\u2019s the opposite when you look at early development. The vast majority is in the smaller early biotechnology companies less than the big pharma. We\u2019d like to see that mix shift over time. But I don\u2019t want to see the shift mix because the small pharma comes down so far and so fast. We haven\u2019t seen a lot more orders necessarily from large pharma, but we\u2019ve actually seen that the smaller biotech market seems to be doing a bit better as we look at the improvement in book-to-bill for the quarter.\nJohn Kim: Got it. And then in terms of margins, I hear you on the top line doing well and the team is executing well. What about in terms of the employee turnover, he has the labor cost inflation tracked within expectations?\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes. So again, overall, we feel good about the margins that we\u2019re having today. We talked about the big drivers of it being from top line growth in our launch pad. But the headwinds obviously continue to be personnel costs, that\u2019s half of our cost structure. The labor market has improved. We assume roughly 3% plus or minus cost inflation, if you will, for personnel costs, which, again, launch pad is helping offset. Overall, for the biopharma business, our attrition rates are where we would expect it to be, the labor count for diagnostics, it\u2019s improved a lot. It\u2019s probably still a little bit higher than, call it, pre-pandemic levels, but in a lot of areas now, it\u2019s more normalized. So it\u2019s really only in certain select areas that we see a little bit more turnover than normal. But overall, we feel positive on the labor situation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays.\nStephanie Davis : We have seen M&A become such a bigger part of even your large competitor\u2019s growth algorithm. And Glenn, you even called out in your prepared remarks that acquisitions are going to be a priority for our free cash flow. So what has changed in the deal environment that\u2019s causing this acceleration? How can we think about the sustainability of this dynamic? And given the incredibly different profile of Invite compared to some of your more recent deals, how should we think about what you\u2019re looking for in the M&A pipeline? I know that\u2019s a many parter, so thank you [indiscernible].\nAdam Schechter : Sure. So Stephanie, when we look at the environment. I\u2019m going to start off first with the hospitals, local regional laboratories. I think during COVID, they realized quickly, particularly the hospital systems that the laboratories weren\u2019t necessarily fully up-to-date with their equipment, that the cost for capital was very expensive and high and they realized that they can take that money and use it for other things in a hospital versus running a laboratory. Historically, I think people were worried could Labcorp bundler laboratory without having an impact to the patient care or the physicians getting the test as quickly as they wanted to. But when you do as many deals as we\u2019ve done recently, there\u2019s so much proof that we can do these extraordinarily well and then we can actually run the hospital laboratories extraordinarily well without interrupting patient care, actually giving them better data analytics, better tools, better equipment. And I think that, that\u2019s kind of reached a plateau where most hospital systems don\u2019t argue anymore on that point. They also appreciate getting some capital, and they can use that capital by selling a laboratory or selling the outreach business to us. And I think that they look to do that. I would say that as hospital systems were struggling more right after COVID, I think they were looking to move quicker than they are today. But at the same time, today, our pipeline remains very, very strong for those hospital deals. The local regional laboratories, I think, are struggling a bit after COVID. And therefore, there\u2019s an opportunity there that we\u2019ll continue to look after. I would say Invitae is not our typical deal. Our typical deal, we want to be accretive in the first year, return this cost of capital in 2 or 3 years and be something that we readily integrate all the time. Invitae, I feel good about our ability to integrate it, but obviously, it wasn\u2019t accretive in the first year. It will be accretive in the second year. That was a strategic decision for us because we believe the inheritant cancer area and the other areas that they\u2019re working on in terms of smaller disease areas will grow so much faster in the future. and we\u2019ve already begun to focus on those areas. We believe that this could be an important add to our portfolio. And I think of it more as a strategic acquisition than the routine acquisitions that we typically do.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Yes. Stephanie, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is -- and as Adam said, the predominance of the dollars that we invest are in the more traditional deals, the hospital systems, independent labs, even specialty test. But the oncology ones, I think we\u2019ve done now maybe 3 transactions that in the first year, if you will, more dilutive, but all specialty oncology focused. But even from that, from a financial return, so after meeting the strategic focus, all of those deals, including invite, have a very attractive long-term financial profile, these businesses tend to grow. I think we commented at a double-digit top line growth rate versus our, call it, mid-single digit for our underlying business. So we think while it\u2019s near-term dilutive it\u2019s a very attractive profile longer term. Having said that, you should continue to expect that the majority of the deals we do fit within the ones that Adam commented about that would even be accretive initially fully burdened by our incremental borrowing costs that the deals will be accretive to earnings and cash in year 1.\nStephanie Davis : So shifting gears a bit then to more of the hospital business. I know you\u2019ve given some color on the immediate margin and cash flow impacts of the extension cyber attack. But have you thought about any follow-on impact to that business, such as volumes slipping to another player in the region or maybe the need to shore up some of their offerings.\nAdam Schechter : No, I feel good about where we are. They\u2019re a great partner. We work side-by-side with them. We work side-by-side with them through their -- through cyber events. So I feel good about our business there. And I think that there\u2019ll be continued success.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly : I was wondering in terms of the utilization trends, how you guys are thinking about the rest of the year or how things trended throughout the quarter, maybe June and July as well. It was helpful to hear about the employer testing piece. So just curious how things trended during the quarter and then the expectations for the rest of the year on utilization.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Patrick, so obviously, for the quarter, we feel very good. We commented a little bit earlier that when you think about it from an organic standpoint, our volume base to base business was up 3.5%. And Adam went through kind of some of the reasons why we feel that we\u2019ve seen some improved growth there and share that\u2019s actually been pretty consistent in that volume growth supplemented, if you will, by favorable mix as we\u2019re growing our esoteric business and the benefit of some of those hospital deals or TSAs as well as the test per session. When you look at the implied outlook for the year, you get to that diagnostics revenues are still looking from a top line at around 9%. So obviously, in the second half, we expect to see continued growth with now invite and part of that guidance for Diagnostics, you\u2019re still looking at an implied, call it, organic growth in the second half of around 5% and then 4% aided by M&A. And of that 5%, we continue to expect to see a similar mix with utilization being the higher part of that growth. So we\u2019re kind of averaging, call it, maybe a trend of 3:1 from the benefit of organic volume versus the favorability from mix that aids there. So we do expect this trend in utilization to continue.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Glenn, maybe one for you. Just you talked a little bit about the margins and LaunchPad and Invitae. Can you just talk about, obviously, a few moving pieces as we work our way through 2H and into \u201825, can you just talk about the puts and takes there with the dilution, the LaunchPad piece, again, labor sounds like it\u2019s maybe plateaued and is stable. But just the cadence for the rest of the year and then again the right jumping off point into next year.\nGlenn Eisenberg : Sure. Just again, from an overall standpoint, margins for the year, as you think about Labcorp, we\u2019ve now commented all in, including the impact of Invitae, our margin should be flat this year. year-over-year in that the impact of Invitae will be around 40 basis points. So forgetting even other headwinds, we expected for the company to see a nice 40 basis point plus margin improvement. When you look at Diagnostics, we commented that prior to Invitae that margins for the year would be flat to slightly up, even absorbing the impact of less COVID business, if you will. Obviously, with now Invitae, it will have around a 60 basis point headwind to Diagnostics. So expect that in the second half of the year, Diagnostics margins will be down year-over-year again, excluding Invite, second half margins in Diagnostics would have been up year-over-year. So positive leverage within the Diagnostics business. And again, we commented that the margins within the Biopharma side, our expectation for the year is for margins to be up and that the margins in the second half for Biopharma will be higher than what it is for the first half. Year-over-year, there will be some differences, but overall, assume a higher second half margin profile for BLS than the first half. So again, we feel we\u2019re getting good top line. We feel we\u2019re leveraging it well. LaunchPad is an integral part of helping our margins help offset some of those inflationary costs. And then obviously, we\u2019re adding on top of that just the near-term dilutive impact from it. When you think about 2025, the only thing I\u2019ll comment really on the Invitae is that assuming the close later on or call it next week, even with Invitae, we\u2019ll still have the headwind in the first half with margin impact being negative from Invitae in the first and second quarters. But what\u2019s interesting is as you move to -- once it\u2019s annualized, you\u2019ll obviously start to see favorable contributions from margins from Invitae because we\u2019re now comping off of positive and growing margins versus the first half of this year with negative margins.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to hand it back to Adam Schechter for closing remarks.\nAdam Schechter : Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on our customers, our business, shareholders and employees as we move forward, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. It's really a pleasure to be here with you today. We look forward to sharing our strong results for the quarter, our updated 2024 outlook and progress on our strategy. Let's turn now to our financial results. In the second quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.94 and free cash flow from continuing operations was $433 million. Enterprise revenue increased 6% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Diagnostics revenue was up 8%, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. Central Laboratories growth was strong at 9%, partially offset by a decline in early development of 15%, resulting in biopharma laboratory services up 1%. The book-to-bill for early development was strong, with higher orders and lower cancellations, and we expect the business to be back to growth towards the end of the year. Adjusted EPS were up 15% and enterprise margins were up slightly. Margins in biopharma increased, while margins in Diagnostics were flat which reflects the impact of a cyber event that affected a large partner. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities through the following: Being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories, harnessing science and innovation to develop and launch new tests in important therapeutic areas, and by utilizing data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers. We are confident in the success of Labcorp in the months and quarters ahead with strong growth in diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services. Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 outlook in just a moment. The 2024 outlook reflects the anticipated close of Invite next week. In the second quarter, Labcorp continued to advance in our strategic growth areas. First, we continue to maintain a leadership position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. Following the quarter end, Labcorp entered into a comprehensive strategic collaboration with Naples Comprehensive Healthcare located in Florida to manage its inpatient lab operations and to serve as the primary lab later this summer. We're also on track to close the previously announced acquisition of select assets of BioReference Health Diagnostics business by the end of the third quarter. We continue to have a very strong business development pipeline, and we look forward to sharing more of those details in the future. We also announced the acquisition of select assets of Invitae, a leading medical genetics company. We're excited about Invitae's complementary cutting-edge science genetic testing solutions and technology, which aligns strategically with our focus on specialty testing and oncology. Together, we will work with our customers to utilize genetic insights to develop new treatments and to deliver personalized care in oncology and in select rare diseases. Upon closing the transaction, we anticipate the first 12 months will provide revenue of $275 million to $300 million. And the first year will be dilutive by approximately 3%. We've included $120 million of revenue in 2024 and the vast majority of dilution in 2024. We expect it to be accretive for 2025 and with top line growth of more than 10% per year. We have a very strong integration team in place with members from both Labcorp and Invitae. We will move quickly and thoughtfully to reduce costs without impacting the great science and the great customer experience that Invitae provides today. Also, we anticipate Invitae will benefit from the full scale and breadth of Labcorp's platform as a global leader in laboratory services. We have great respect for Invitae's capabilities and team, and we look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Labcorp. As we advance our growth strategy, we continue to make great strides and expanding our testing solutions. In April, Labcorp received FDA approval as the amenitarian-use device for its companion diagnostic to determine patient eligibility for treatment with Pfizer's gene therapy for hemophilia B. This is expected to expand Labcorp's leadership in [indiscernible] medicine and in gene therapy. We introduced the first trimester screening test to assess preeclampsia risk during pregnancy. It is the only test of its kind available in the United States available for order by physicians for their patients. including those with a low to average risk for preeclampsia or first-time pregnancies. Roughly 1 in 25 presidencies in the United States is affected by the condition. And with this test, Labcorp is the only lab that can detect preeclampsia risk across all trimesters of pregnancy. We announced several new strategic service offerings with our precision oncology portfolio. extending our leadership in oncology. Our comprehensive genomic profiling service, Labcorp Tissue Complete is now available through our laboratory network centers in Geneva and Shanghai to support global PINNACLE trials. We've also added OmniSeq Insight circulating tumor DNA to a portfolio of comprehensive genomic profiling services. Together, these solutions support customers as they advance of therapeutic development programs. Lastly, we continue to expand Labcorp on-demand our consumer-initiated testing offering with the launch of several new tests in May and June, including standard drug, complete drug comprehensive testosterone, HIV and complete heart health. We also continue to focus on creating easy-to-use digital technology signutions for our customers. In the quarter, we launched a suite of solutions referred to as Global Trial Connect, aimed at increasing the speed and efficiency of clinical trials. This solution differentiates Labcorp in the market and has been well received by our customers. In closing, I'd like to thank our team of more than 65,000 employees around the world. Together, we are focused on our customers achieving our financial commitments and making meaningful progress on our strategy, we have strong momentum and significant growth opportunities ahead of us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Yes, sure. So first of all, if you look at the business in terms of biopharma laboratory services. We had very strong growth in our central laboratories of about 9%, and early development declined 15%. Both of those businesses are leaders in their respective markets. We believe we reached the trough for early development, and that's based upon the cancellations that we spoke about in the past. If you look at the book-to-bill for the quarter, it was strong, and it was strong for several reasons. Number one, because the orders were strong. But importantly, number two, because there were significantly less cancellations than what we've seen in prior quarters. So that's what gives us the confidence for the improved performance that we expect in the early development as we go throughout the year. With regard to Invitae accretion in 2025, we said from the beginning that we were going to use calendar months because we didn't know the exact timing of closing. And we said it would be dilutive in the first 12 months and accretive in the second 12 months. It's closing a bit faster than we originally anticipated, which is good because we'll be able to move quicker. That's why you see a bit more dilution in 2024 than you may have anticipated, but that's also why it becomes accretive in 2025. Yes, absolutely. It's an exciting time, and we spent a lot of time with our colleagues that will be coming over for Invitae. And first and foremost, the sales organization is very excited. They're excited because they now have a broader portfolio of products. It's one thing to go into an office and talk about inherited cancers. It's another thing to say, but you can also test for all the other things that you may want to test that patient for. And ultimately, we're going to try to bring that all together so the physician can order directly through one tool and get whatever they need for the patients. So the sales organization is very excited about the breadth of what they'll bring into those customers. In addition to that, we have such strong partnerships that are abroad at LabCorp. We're hoping to be able to use those partnerships and have discussions with them about our new offering through Invitae. So although we've not built in significant upside for the future with the new customers, we may be able to bring additional tests to. We believe that this market is going to grow significantly faster than other markets that we compete in, and we believe that there'll be more than 10% growth in this market versus other markets as we go forward. So we think it's a very exciting opportunity as we go forward. We're excited about welcoming our new colleagues. They're excited about being part of Labcorp, and we're going to move extraordinarily fast but thoughtful. Yes. So, we've seen a decrease in employer side. But it's not that big or material to us, that was something we would call out. But there's no doubt that you're seeing as some employers haven't fully come back to work. They don't have the events that they used to have for wellness. Sometimes they're not doing the vaccinations that they used to do in office spaces. But it's less than 5% of our business. So it's not material to us. Yes. Elizabeth, I'll take the second question first, and I'll ask Glenn to comment a bit about the first question. It's good to see the orders coming back and the cancellations being reduced in early development. That's what's giving us confidence in revenue growth as we go throughout the year. I would say the biggest difference in pricing that we've seen is the price of the NHPs. They were much more expensive last year than they are this year. when the price went up, that was largely passed through to the customers. So we weren't making margin on that business. Now that the price is lower, it actually helps with the margin a bit, but that's the biggest difference. Yes, I would say it's relatively stable. I mean it's always under pressure. There's always pressure there. But I'd say continued pressure relatively stable. Sure, Jack. First of all, when we first made the announcement, we very quickly put an integration team together of very competent, qualified people across all parts of Labcorp, and we match them with equally confident people across all parts of Invitae. So we've had an integration team that has been working really hard to ensure that we have a very smooth transition. I feel very good about the work that they've done. As we look at their monthly sales, they're relatively stable. And we feel good about the way in which they've managed their business through what I would say, some pretty difficult turmoil. And their team has done, I think, an extraordinary job of trying to hang on to customers and hang on to business. So the question I'm asking the integration team is where do we see upside? What else can we go after with the new portfolio that they'll have, the increased relationships and partnerships that we have. So I'm actually less concerned about the leakage and I'm more focused on where the growth opportunities are. Sure, Kevin. So if you look at the revenue was $2.5 billion for Diagnostics, and it increased by about 8%. You break down 8%, it was about 6% up from volume and price/mix was up about 2%. So as you stated, it was a very good, strong performance I think there's a couple of things that are driving it. First of all, it's -- the team has done a really good job executing in the marketplace. Number two, the hospital and local regional laboratory deals that we're doing, they're very good deals in themselves, but there is certainly some spillover that occurs in the geographies that are surrounding those areas. We are seeing continued strength in the number of tests per accession, which is helpful. And we continue to see a slight shift in mix when it comes to specialty testing or esoteric testing versus routine testing. And I think all those things together are giving us the uplift that we're seeing. And as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to see continued strength of about the same type of momentum. We've talked about the importance of tests in 4 areas, specifically women's health, oncology, neurology and autoimmune disease. And we've been really focused on launching new tests in those areas ensuring that we're having discussions with opinion leaders. We've increased our scientific wherewithal in the marketplace in those areas. And those areas, the reason we're focused on is they grow faster than the other parts of diagnostic testing. Now when you run 650 million tests a year, even if you're seeing a shift in mix, it's hard to see that in market share. I mean, you can do the math on what the market share point is. But we're certainly starting to see some growth in the specialty areas. And I think it's partially due to the market, and it's also partially due to our focus. Yes. Absolutely, Lisa. So continue to believe that the right path forward is to improvements and to enact the valid act, frankly. And that was legislation that was developed specifically for laboratory diagnostics, including LDTs. That had broad bipartisan support, and we think that's the right way forward. As you said, our trade organization, ACLA did file a lawsuit and they're challenging the FDA's final rule, and we're supportive of ACLA doing that. In the meantime, of course, we're going to be prepared to adhere to the LDT ruling. And when you look at the science, we do the vast majority of that science. I mean we submit all -- I mean, most if not all of our LDTs to New York state already. But at the same time, there are some things that we have to be prepared for in terms of monitoring and reporting requirements and so forth. And we have a team in place that ensure that we're ready for that to occur as soon as the LDT rule is final. At the same time, it's not going to have a significant impact to our revenue or to our expenses. I think the bigger impact is going to be to patients. And these LDTs are typically for people with rare diseases or smaller patient populations. And the question is, will the FDA even have the ability to approve these quick enough so that all patients have access to these important tests as quickly as possible. So to me, it's more of a patient access and important for patients than it is any type of impact to Labcorp, frankly. Yes. So we continue to strongly support the SALSA legislation. And I've been saying this for, I think, 4 years now. And it has strong bipartisan support. And I've been saying that for 4 years now. So it's kind of remarkable to me that it has not passed yet. And it continues to have strong support. We continue to be very supportive of it ourselves. But it's really hard to know if it will be passed again this year even though we're going to try to push for it to be passed. What I would say is that if it is not past this year, I do believe that there's a likelihood that will be delayed again. And if it's delayed again, that would be $80 million that we would not see as a downside next year, and a lot of that would fall to the bottom line. So let's wait to see how the year plays out. When we give guidance in February next year, we'll know what's happened and where we are. But in the meantime, we're going to continue to push to SALSA as best we can. Yes. So what I'd say, Erin, is that we're obviously not giving 2025 guidance today. But as I look at the trends, and I look at the things that I am considering as we go into 2025, the market dynamics continue to be strong. And what's interesting about the Diagnostics business in particular, is that regardless of Republican President, [ Democratic President], resessions, nonrecessions. The business is very durable and has shown its durability over time. So I feel very good about our Diagnostics business, the underlying performance. I would say the biggest headwind/tailwind is going to be what we just talked about, which is does PAMA occur or does it not occur. As I think about the Biopharma Laboratory businesses, we have momentum, we have strength I feel good about our orders and our order book as we go into the end of this year. And I expect that our book-to-bill is going to continue to improve even from where it is today, which is strong as we go through the rest of this year, and that would bode well as we go into 2025. And again, the biggest headwinds/tailwinds there is just what happens with the smaller biotech companies in the marketplace as well as pharma and what they decide to do based upon their environment. Yes. So if you look at the mix of business, it's a very different mix, if you look at the central laboratory business versus the early development business. And I'm just going to give you some rough numbers. I assume it's about 70% larger pharma, large biotech in central laboratory and maybe 30% of the small biotech. And it's the opposite when you look at early development. The vast majority is in the smaller early biotechnology companies less than the big pharma. We'd like to see that mix shift over time. But I don't want to see the shift mix because the small pharma comes down so far and so fast. We haven't seen a lot more orders necessarily from large pharma, but we've actually seen that the smaller biotech market seems to be doing a bit better as we look at the improvement in book-to-bill for the quarter. Sure. So Stephanie, when we look at the environment. I'm going to start off first with the hospitals, local regional laboratories. I think during COVID, they realized quickly, particularly the hospital systems that the laboratories weren't necessarily fully up-to-date with their equipment, that the cost for capital was very expensive and high and they realized that they can take that money and use it for other things in a hospital versus running a laboratory. Historically, I think people were worried could Labcorp bundler laboratory without having an impact to the patient care or the physicians getting the test as quickly as they wanted to. But when you do as many deals as we've done recently, there's so much proof that we can do these extraordinarily well and then we can actually run the hospital laboratories extraordinarily well without interrupting patient care, actually giving them better data analytics, better tools, better equipment. And I think that, that's kind of reached a plateau where most hospital systems don't argue anymore on that point. They also appreciate getting some capital, and they can use that capital by selling a laboratory or selling the outreach business to us. And I think that they look to do that. I would say that as hospital systems were struggling more right after COVID, I think they were looking to move quicker than they are today. But at the same time, today, our pipeline remains very, very strong for those hospital deals. The local regional laboratories, I think, are struggling a bit after COVID. And therefore, there's an opportunity there that we'll continue to look after. I would say Invitae is not our typical deal. Our typical deal, we want to be accretive in the first year, return this cost of capital in 2 or 3 years and be something that we readily integrate all the time. Invitae, I feel good about our ability to integrate it, but obviously, it wasn't accretive in the first year. It will be accretive in the second year. That was a strategic decision for us because we believe the inheritant cancer area and the other areas that they're working on in terms of smaller disease areas will grow so much faster in the future. and we've already begun to focus on those areas. We believe that this could be an important add to our portfolio. And I think of it more as a strategic acquisition than the routine acquisitions that we typically do. No, I feel good about where we are. They're a great partner. We work side-by-side with them. We work side-by-side with them through their -- through cyber events. So I feel good about our business there. And I think that there'll be continued success. Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We're going to continue to focus on our customers, our business, shareholders and employees as we move forward, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you next quarter. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing and foreign exchange. The base business grew 6.9% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 4.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $295 million or 9.2% of revenue or 14.9% on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, we had $100 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $23 million of expense for the transition service agreements related to the spin of Fortrea with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $62 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $480 million or 14.9% of revenue. compared to $448 million or 14.8% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was due to the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings that were partially offset by higher personnel expenses. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 23.9% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and additional R&D tax credits. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $206 million or $2.43 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.94 in the quarter, up 15% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $561 million in the quarter compared to $162 million a year ago. The increase in cash flow was due to cash earnings and working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $128 million in the quarter or 4% of revenue. This compares to $103 million or 3.4% in the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $433 million. During the quarter, the company invested $34 million in acquisitions, paid out $60 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of stock. The Board of Directors has approved an increase in its share repurchase authorization by $1 billion to a total of $1.4 billion. At quarter end, we had $265 million in cash, while debt was $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.4x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We have $2 billion of debt maturing over the next 12 months, and we expect to refinance it later this year. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year, with organic growth of 4.7% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 3.2% and partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The base business grew 8.9% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 5.7%. Total volume increased 5.7% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 6.3% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 3.5% while acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Price mix increased 2.1% versus last year due to an organic base business increase that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price/mix was up 2.2% compared to the base business last year. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $442 million or 17.5% of revenue, compared to $410 million or 17.5% last year. Adjusted operating income was up due to organic demand, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Operating margins were flat but would have been up approximately 20 basis points, were it not for the impact of a cyber event that affected a large partner. Now I'll review the segment performance in biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $707 million, an increase of 1.1% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 1.2%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 9%, while early development was down 15% due to the higher than normal cancellations and lower orders in prior periods. However, we did see a sequential improvement in early development, gross orders and cancellations, which we expect will lead to higher revenues in the second half of the year and deliver year-over-year growth beginning in the fourth quarter. Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $107 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $105 million or 15% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.9 billion and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12 months book-to-bill held at 1.00 compared to last quarter and is expected to increase in the second half. Now I'll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. The acquisition of select assets of Invitae, which is expected to close next week, is now included in our guidance for 2024. For the remainder of the year, we expect Invitae to add approximately $120 million in revenue. lower adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.40 and reduced cash flow by approximately $150 million, primarily due to onetime costs related to retention, severance and integration as well as an increase in working capital. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 6.4% to 7.5% compared to 2023 versus prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint 135 basis points with Invitae contributing approximately 100 basis points of the growth. We continue to perform well in Diagnostics. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 6.9% to 7.9% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 200 basis points due to stronger base business demand and invite, which is expected to contribute around 130 basis points of the growth. We expect Biopharma revenue to grow 3.7% to 5% compared to 2023. The decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 35 basis points is due to early development, partially offset by continued strength in central labs. We expect early development to have a slower recovery than previously anticipated, but with year-over-year growth still expected to begin in the fourth quarter. We expect enterprise margins to be flat versus the prior year despite the negative impact from Invitae of approximately 40 basis points. Diagnostics margins are now expected to be down due to the inclusion of Invitae of approximately 60 basis points. We continue to expect margins in biopharma to be up year-over-year. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $14.90. We have decreased the midpoint of guidance by $0.30, driven by the expected dilution from Invitae of approximately $0.40 and partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the underlying business. The free cash flow guidance range is now $850 million to $1 billion and includes approximately $150 million of a cash use from Invitae, which is primarily due to onetime costs. Excluding Invitae, the free cash flow guidance range is unchanged from prior guidance. In summary, LabCorp is well positioned for profitable growth, both organically as well as through acquisitions. We're excited about the acquisition of Invitae from both a strategic and financial perspective. Strategically, this strengthens our position in key long-term specialty testing growth areas of oncology and select rare diseases. From a financial perspective, while it's dilutive in 2024, we expect it to be accretive in 2025 and deliver a very attractive return on investment as we profitably grow the business. In addition, Labcorp continues to generate strong free cash flow that will be used for acquisitions while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. Operator, we'll now take questions. Yes, Andrew. Yes, it's our expectation that we will refinance all of the debt. We're not going to look to pay it down. We have around $1 billion of it due between now and the end of the year, starting actually in September and then $1 billion that's due in February. We expect to refinance all of that this year. Obviously, the markets have improved nicely. So we'll have that done. For modeling purposes, if you wanted to look at kind of the net interest expense line, we will refinance, obviously, at a light higher rate than what's maturing. Our net interest expense this year directionally will come in at around $210 million. And then obviously, once it's annualized for next year, that will tick up to maybe around $240 million. Again, we'll see ultimately when we go into the markets. But right now, the markets look pretty attractive. Eric, it's Glenn. I'll take a first cut. But overall, again, we feel good about how we're positioned now within the biopharma group and Central Lab clearly has had a very strong first half, and we expect that to continue. What's interesting is the growth rate that we had in the first half benefited a little bit based upon the comp we had a year ago, given some softness in the investigator sites with some labor constraints but a solid first half, and we expect a more normalized growth rate within the Central Lab in the second half. The flip side is within ED, again, we are seeing a little bit of a slower recovery. But based upon in Adam's remarks with a stronger order book in the quarter with cancellations coming back down to more normal, we feel confident that we'll see sequential improvement in the revenues of ED in both the third and the fourth. So not kind of the hockey stick, but a continued progression but that in the fourth quarter, we'll now start to see favorable comps year-on-year. So an improved outlook in the third, but still down year-on-year for ED, but in the fourth and improved revenues with positive comps. Go ahead, Elizabeth. And then Elizabeth, on the first part. So when you look at, again, excluding Invitae, the underlying business, we've increased the outlook at the top line. So overall, at the midpoint, we're up around 135 basis points, 100 of it from Invitae. So the underlying business is up, both upon the performance in the second quarter as well as an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. The growth, as we commented earlier, and the outlook improvement is an increase in our outlook for Diagnostics organically, for Central Labs organically and partially offset by a little lower outlook within the early development business. but the strength of the higher top line growth is obviously what's translating down to the bottom line, which causes us to have the underlying business, excluding Invitae, where we would have increased the midpoint of our EPS guidance range by $0.10. Jack, so on the -- our partner that had a cyber event, again, it did not affect Labcorp, but did affect our partner. We commented that it was around a 20 basis point headwind during the quarter from the margin of diagnostics. That's roughly around $5 million of, call it, operating income that would have been foregone. A little bit of some timing delay in cash as well that we'll get that just delayed from the second quarter to the third. But obviously, we had a very strong free cash flow number overall for the quarter in any event. We didn't comment on the CrowdStrike or frankly, even the hurricane impact in our results. Obviously, it happened after the second quarter. So when you think about the magnitude of those you're also looking probably around $0.05 a share impact to earnings. So when you look at the change in our guide other than Invitae, where we took the underlying business guide up $0.10 that's even after absorbing the impact from that IT outage event and the weather impact. Yes. Also, Kevin, just to kind of reinforce what Adam had said that when you look at the volume growth that we're now experiencing. And again, organically, our base business was up 3.5%. Obviously, it's higher than what our historical growth is, and we attribute that in part, as Adam said, to some of the sheer growth around the hospital outreach labs that we've acquired as we penetrate those markets even stronger than maybe they had as well. But overall, when we look at the comps now to 2019, the CAGRs are stronger than historical averages. So where last year, we saw some of the improved growth rates, really more a function of a softer comp year-over-year, we actually think now we're comping to a more normal period a year ago and that the growth rates are now more sustainable. And as Adam said, as we give our guidance and what's implied is that we will continue to see -- we expect that strong level of both volume growth but also favorable mix along the lines that Adam had commented on. Yes. No. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the LaunchPad activities. We talk about around $100 million to $125 million per year of savings. We comment that, that's what we look to do to help offset the inflationary expenses primarily related to personnel, which would fall within that, call it, $100 million to $125 million level. So we are able to offset that. We do normally expect to see good leverage on the incremental volume and revenues that we have. And obviously, you saw in the case of biopharma, good leverage on modest top line growth with margins that were up, benefiting from LaunchPad. And even within Diagnostics, while margins were flat during the quarter, we commented about the cyber event. We're still dealing with a little bit of a headwind from lower COVID as well. But as we think about the full year, the leverage, ideally, we'd leverage at around a gross profit margin for the business that we're approaching that level for the full year when you take out the unusual items or the discrete items that could be a headwind. So that we think, as Adam commented earlier, the business is performing well from a top line standpoint and from an operational standpoint. Yes. So again, overall, we feel good about the margins that we're having today. We talked about the big drivers of it being from top line growth in our launch pad. But the headwinds obviously continue to be personnel costs, that's half of our cost structure. The labor market has improved. We assume roughly 3% plus or minus cost inflation, if you will, for personnel costs, which, again, launch pad is helping offset. Overall, for the biopharma business, our attrition rates are where we would expect it to be, the labor count for diagnostics, it's improved a lot. It's probably still a little bit higher than, call it, pre-pandemic levels, but in a lot of areas now, it's more normalized. So it's really only in certain select areas that we see a little bit more turnover than normal. But overall, we feel positive on the labor situation. Yes. Stephanie, the only thing I'd add to that is -- and as Adam said, the predominance of the dollars that we invest are in the more traditional deals, the hospital systems, independent labs, even specialty test. But the oncology ones, I think we've done now maybe 3 transactions that in the first year, if you will, more dilutive, but all specialty oncology focused. But even from that, from a financial return, so after meeting the strategic focus, all of those deals, including invite, have a very attractive long-term financial profile, these businesses tend to grow. I think we commented at a double-digit top line growth rate versus our, call it, mid-single digit for our underlying business. So we think while it's near-term dilutive it's a very attractive profile longer term. Having said that, you should continue to expect that the majority of the deals we do fit within the ones that Adam commented about that would even be accretive initially fully burdened by our incremental borrowing costs that the deals will be accretive to earnings and cash in year 1. Patrick, so obviously, for the quarter, we feel very good. We commented a little bit earlier that when you think about it from an organic standpoint, our volume base to base business was up 3.5%. And Adam went through kind of some of the reasons why we feel that we've seen some improved growth there and share that's actually been pretty consistent in that volume growth supplemented, if you will, by favorable mix as we're growing our esoteric business and the benefit of some of those hospital deals or TSAs as well as the test per session. When you look at the implied outlook for the year, you get to that diagnostics revenues are still looking from a top line at around 9%. So obviously, in the second half, we expect to see continued growth with now invite and part of that guidance for Diagnostics, you're still looking at an implied, call it, organic growth in the second half of around 5% and then 4% aided by M&A. And of that 5%, we continue to expect to see a similar mix with utilization being the higher part of that growth. So we're kind of averaging, call it, maybe a trend of 3:1 from the benefit of organic volume versus the favorability from mix that aids there. So we do expect this trend in utilization to continue. Sure. Just again, from an overall standpoint, margins for the year, as you think about Labcorp, we've now commented all in, including the impact of Invitae, our margin should be flat this year. year-over-year in that the impact of Invitae will be around 40 basis points. So forgetting even other headwinds, we expected for the company to see a nice 40 basis point plus margin improvement. When you look at Diagnostics, we commented that prior to Invitae that margins for the year would be flat to slightly up, even absorbing the impact of less COVID business, if you will. Obviously, with now Invitae, it will have around a 60 basis point headwind to Diagnostics. So expect that in the second half of the year, Diagnostics margins will be down year-over-year again, excluding Invite, second half margins in Diagnostics would have been up year-over-year. So positive leverage within the Diagnostics business. And again, we commented that the margins within the Biopharma side, our expectation for the year is for margins to be up and that the margins in the second half for Biopharma will be higher than what it is for the first half. Year-over-year, there will be some differences, but overall, assume a higher second half margin profile for BLS than the first half. So again, we feel we're getting good top line. We feel we're leveraging it well. LaunchPad is an integral part of helping our margins help offset some of those inflationary costs. And then obviously, we're adding on top of that just the near-term dilutive impact from it. When you think about 2025, the only thing I'll comment really on the Invitae is that assuming the close later on or call it next week, even with Invitae, we'll still have the headwind in the first half with margin impact being negative from Invitae in the first and second quarters. But what's interesting is as you move to -- once it's annualized, you'll obviously start to see favorable contributions from margins from Invitae because we're now comping off of positive and growing margins versus the first half of this year with negative margins."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings' First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christin O'Donnell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nChristin O'Donnell: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures both of which are discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2024 guidance, and the related assumptions, the recently completed spinoff of Fortrea Holdings, Inc., the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition including the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic and market conditions; future business strategies, expected savings, benefits and synergies from the LaunchPad initiatives and from acquisitions and other strategic transactions and partnerships, the planned holding company reorganization and opportunities for future growth.\n Each of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter. \nAdam Schechter: Thank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2024 results and progress on our strategy. But before I do that, I want to address the recent announcement that LabCorp was selected as the winning bidder for select assets of Invitae.\n This transaction will advance our strategy to launch and scale specialty testing in areas such as oncology and rare diseases. These are strong assets in important disease areas, and they fit strategically with our focus on specialty testing. Invitae has strong science, a great NGS platform and strong talent. Upon completion of the transaction, LabCorp expects approximately $275 million to $300 million in annual revenue, with the vast majority in specialty areas, such as oncology and rare diseases.  \n The purchase price for the transaction is $239 million. We expect the transaction to be dilutive to adjusted earnings by approximately 2% to 3% in the first full year. We expect the transaction to be accretive in year 2 and to exceed our cost of capital in year 3.\n Now I'll move to the quarter. LabCorp delivered strong top line performance in the first quarter driven by growth in both of our businesses, Diagnostic Laboratories and Biopharma Laboratory Services. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities through being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories through launching key new tests in important therapeutic areas and by harnessing science, technology and innovation to bring new tests, services and capabilities to our customers around the world.\n Let's turn now to our first quarter financial results. In the first quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $3.68. Enterprise revenue for the quarter increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with Diagnostics revenue up 4% and Biopharma revenue up 8%. Biopharma's growth was driven by strength in central laboratories, partially offset by early development research laboratories. Enterprise-based business margins are up compared to the prior year. Higher margins in Biopharma were partially offset by Diagnostics margins. We expect margins in both businesses to be up for the full year. The overall strength in our business enabled us to narrow the range and raised the midpoint of our EPS full year guidance to $14.90 despite a negative impact from currency.\n Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 outlook in just a moment. In the first quarter, LabCorp advanced key growth initiatives that support our strategy. We began 2024 with positive momentum, reinforcing our position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. We continue to be active on the acquisition front.\n We closed three transactions in March, including health system agreements with Baystate Health in Massachusetts and Providence in California and a regional lab acquisition in California. In March, we also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of BioReference Health's diagnostic business. This transaction will increase access to LabCorp's high-quality clinical laboratory services.\n These new assets are focused on clinical diagnostics and reproductive and women's health. Our business development pipeline remains strong. Building on the success of our acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we continue to incorporate the power of science, technology and innovation across the organization. This commitment is demonstrated by how we've expanded our test menu this quarter. We advanced our leadership in neurodegenerative disease with the launch of pTau217 blood-based biomarker test that aids in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the monitoring of patients undergoing treatment with new therapies.\n It's also available to be used in clinical trials. In addition, earlier this month, we announced the launch of our GFAP blood biomarker test for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological injuries. Following the launch of our ATN profile last fall, these two significant advances in the company's testing portfolio extend our leadership in a rapidly accelerating field of blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.\n We continue to accelerate our leadership in oncology. We launched LabCorp plasma detect, the first clinically validated whole genome sequencing MRD solution for early-stage colon cancer to identify patients at increased risk of reoccurrence after surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy. LabCorp plasma detect developed by our PGDx laboratory is a significant achievement that enhances our liquid biopsy portfolio and strengthens our position at the forefront of driving better patient outcomes in oncology.\n We introduced a weight loss management test portfolio in the quarter, a suite of tests that supports individuals and physicians with accessible and convenient testing options to guide weight loss management decisions and treatment, including lifestyle modifications, GLP-1 medications or bariatric surgery. LabCorp OnDemand introduced a magnesium test and a micronutrient test to measure key vitamin and mineral levels to support individual wellness. We also announced an STI pass for Mgen. Mgen can be as widespread as chlamydia and gonorrhea. This test includes a reflex to identify resistance to macrolides, a commonly used treatment addressing high antibiotic resistance and treatment failures associated with the infection.\n In April, we received emergency use authorization from the FDA for our Mpox PCR test, a home collection kit. The test is the first at-home collection kit authorized by the FDA to aid in the diagnosis of infection with Mpox. Physicians can order for patients 18 years of age or older who are suspected of Mpox infection. In addition, we launched our electronic requisition digital capability to help Biopharma customers and investigator sites, improve protocol compliance by reducing errors, queries, holes and data revisions. \n Earlier this month, we released our latest corporate responsibility report, which highlights the significant progress that we're making as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives in a sustainable way. \n We invite you to take some time to review the report that can be found on our Investor Relations website. As part of our earnings release this morning, we also announced our intention to create a new holding company named LabCorp Holdings Inc. to more closely align with our brand and better position us as a global organization. I'd like to thank our team of more than 67,000 employees around the world. Their ongoing commitment has once again earned us recognition of Fortune's World's most Admired Companies list. We're extremely proud of this recognition.\n In summary, we continue to make progress against our strategy and to achieving both near-term and longer-term goals. We remain focused on our position as leaders in science, technology and innovation, and driving further value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\n Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4.6% compared to last year. Primarily due to organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The Base Business grew 6.7% compared to the Base Business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 70%. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 4.3%. Operating income for the quarter was $321 million, 10.1% of revenue or 14.3% on an adjusted basis.\n During the quarter, we had $49 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $22 million of expense for transition service agreements related to the spin of Fortrea, with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $60 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $453 million or 14.3% of revenue compared to $448 million or 14.7% last year.\n The margin decline was due to lower COVID testing. Base Business margins were up as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 22.1% last year.\n The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to a stock-based compensation benefit in the prior year. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $228 million or $2.69 per diluted share.\n Adjusted EPS were $3.68 in the quarter, up 7% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was a use of $30 million in the quarter compared to $186 million generated a year ago. The reduction in cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, primarily related to deferred taxes and the timing of working capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $134 million in the quarter or 4.2% of revenue.\n This compares to $78 million or 2.6% in the prior year, which was impacted by the pending spin of Fortrea. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was a use of $164 million. The first quarter is seasonally the company's lowest quarter for free cash flow.\n We continue to expect free cash flow for the full year to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion. During the quarter, the company invested $259 million in acquisitions and paid out $62 million in dividends. At quarter end, we had $99 million in cash, while debt was $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.5x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\n Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 4.1% compared to last year, with organic growth of 1.8% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 2.2%. The Base Business grew 6.8% compared to the Base Business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 70%. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 4.4%.\n Total volume increased 3.4% compared to last year. Base Business volume grew 4.9% compared to the Base Business last year as organic volume increased 2.7%, while acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Price/mix increased 0.6% versus last year due to an organic base business increase that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base Business organic price/mix was up 1.7% compared to the base business last year.\n Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $418 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to [ $442 ] million or 18.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID testing,  while Base Business income was up as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. The decrease in adjusted operating income margin was due to the reduction in COVID testing, the negative impact from weather and the mix impact from lab management agreements, which we expect to improve over time.\n Now I'll review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $711 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 5.1% and foreign currency translation of 2.4%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 13%, while early development was down 4% due to continued higher-than-normal cancellations and lower orders. While cancellations are higher than normal, we have seen a sequential improvement from last quarter.\n Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $100 million or 14.1% of revenue compared to $74 million or 11.1% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.9 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.00, which we expect to increase throughout the year.\n Now I'll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 4.8% to 6.4% compared to 2023.\n Compared to prior guidance, this is a narrowing of the range with the same midpoint despite a 50 basis point headwind from currency. We continue to perform well in diagnostics and are narrowing the full year guidance range and increasing the midpoint. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 4.8% to 6% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 140 basis points, primarily due to stronger base business demand as well as acquisition revenue that is now forecasted in this segment, where it was previously only included in the enterprise guidance prior to the closing of the transactions.\n We expect Biopharma revenue to grow 3.7% to 5.7% compared to 2023. The decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 180 basis points is due to currency. This guidance includes the year-over-year positive from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points versus 220 basis points in the prior guidance. An improvement in the outlook for Central Labs is expected to be offset by early development. We continue to expect margins in Diagnostics and Biopharma to be up in 2024 versus 2023, driven by top line growth and LaunchPad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.45 to $15.35. \n We have narrowed the range and increased the midpoint of guidance by $0.05, driven by improvement in Diagnostics, partially offset by the change in currency. The free cash flow guidance range is $1 billion to $1.15 billion, unchanged from prior guidance. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\n Operator, we will now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. \nJack Meehan: So I wanted to focus on the Invitae deal here. Let's start with Adam. Can you talk about the strategic value of these assets why you're excited to acquire them out of bankruptcy? And how does the oncology business complement? What you're doing already internally? \nAdam Schechter: Yes, Jack, so they're strong assets. And we've always said that oncology is one of our core therapeutic areas, and they have a very big hereditary oncology business, much bigger than the business that we have in that area. So it certainly augments what we're doing and it accelerates it in a fairly significant way. They also have quite a bit of rare disease work that they've done, and that augments our focus on specialty testing.\n They have a very good NGS platform. We have a platform, but we're going to look to see what we can use that they have and use what we have and get the best platform we can possibly get. They have very good talent. And I think we're able to do it at a reasonable deal. It's a company that people have looked at for years and years that their valuation you could never get past. But the science was always very good. Their capabilities were always very good. So strategic that feel fits very well for us. \nJack Meehan: Yes, that makes a ton of sense. And then a second one for Glenn. Can you just talk about the strategy to work down the dilution? Prior to the bankruptcy, I think Invitae was targeting a burn of over $200 million. Some of that's related to things you're not acquiring, but your target -- you laid out calls for maybe $30 million to $50 million burn was my math. Can you just talk about the confidence it won't be worse than that and then the action steps to get to accretion in year 2? \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes, Jack. So again, as Adam commented, we're very excited about the acquisition. And frankly, going out of acquiring the select assets through bankruptcy from a purchase price, obviously, relative to other deals that we see of similar focus in our therapeutic areas is quite attractive. As we think about long-term value creation, you heard in the opening comments that we expect this to exceed our cost of capital in year 3 and have a very attractive overall return on our investment.\n But to your point, in the near term, it will be dilutive. This is a business that has a high cost structure. And from our perspective, like other acquisitions that we've done of similar ilk we'll be able to leverage the cost structure within LabCorp to leverage. It's a business that has a very high gross margin, which is, again, very attractive to us. Obviously, we'll continue to instill LaunchPad disciplines that we have which will benefit them as well. But the big opportunity to improve their profitability is on the cost side. They spend a fair amount in R&D, which we would expect to continue. Obviously, the value of what we're acquiring. But from sales, marketing and especially general administrative costs, where we can leverage our infrastructure we'll be able to get it profitable, as Adam said, within the first year. So it's all about integration. We'll do it on a very disciplined and timely manner, but we expect it to ultimately be accretive in the second full year of our ownership. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. \nErin Wilson Wright: Could we talk a little bit about what's embedded in guidance as it relates to the acquisition contribution versus organic growth and base business strength in the Diagnostics segment. I just want to make sure kind of can you remind us what's embedded in the enterprise level guidance versus the segment level guidance as well. \nGlenn Eisenberg: When we talk about the 3 acquisitions that we announced in the quarter, that's adding obviously to the change in the guidance we did for diagnostics. So when you look at the change, just use the midpoint of our guidance, it improved 140 basis points, I assume roughly half of that is from those 3 acquisitions.\n And again, those were already incorporated in our enterprise guidance but not until the segment, until the deals were closed. So half of it is due to the acquisitions, and then the other half of the growth is demand. The strength that we saw in the first quarter that we also expect to see continued through the year. \nErin Wilson Wright: Okay. That's helpful. And then switching to the Biopharma segment, what are you expecting for the balance of the year at this point? What are you seeing in terms of RFP flow and cancellations? And how would you just characterize the underlying health, particularly across that early development business? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll start overall and then I'll answer early development specifically, Erin. So overall, Biopharma Laboratory Services grew 8% and Central Labs had very strong growth at 13%. Now realizing Central Labs had a relatively easy compare versus first quarter of last year. You probably remember in first quarter of last year, there were a lot of personnel issues at investigator sites. If you look at the ED growth, it's coming back slower than we anticipated, but it's being offset by the strength in our Central Lab business.\n If you look at RFP flow, for Central Lab, everything looks normal, everything looks really strong. That business is very healthy. If you look at early development, we still continue to have good RFP flow. The win rates are good.  The cancellations still remain higher than what we would expect. The first quarter was a bit better than fourth quarter of last year, but still higher than what we anticipate. So as we go through the rest of the year, we were able to maintain the revenue guidance for BLS, if you just adjust only for foreign exchange where Central Labs is going to continue to outperform, and we expect it's going to take a bit longer for the early development business to fully come back. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. \nPatrick Donnelly: I want to pick up kind of right where you left off there on the Biopharma piece. Can you just dive a little bit deeper into early development. Obviously, again, the book-to-bill softened a little bit there on the BLS side. There's a lot of focus on the early development piece. Can you just talk about the visibility on that front? And again, the expectations as we work our way through the year, maybe both on orders and the revenue side would be helpful. \nAdam Schechter: Sure. So I'll start with the book-to-bill. So the book-to-bill was 1.0 that's lower than we would typically like. However, we've got insight to the book-to-bill for second quarter already and insight to the rest of the year. And I expect the book-to-bill to continue to grow starting next quarter throughout the rest of the year. The health of the book-to-bill still looks good across the business. It's an early development part of the book-to-bill, which frankly, is a little bit less relevant because early development, a lot of the studies start in the year and finish in the year. Typically with the book-to-bill, you look for things that go more than a year or over time.\n So as I look at the early development book-to-bill, it's not where we would like it at the moment, but the RFPs are good. The win rate looks good. It's the cancellations that are driving the majority of the issues. But that can correct itself faster typically because the burn rate is so much quicker. As we go through the rest of the year, we expect that the early development business starting in the second half will begin to be stronger than the first half. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add too, Patrick, is when you put the size of the business in perspective, obviously, it's less than 10% of the company. But even within Biopharma you have 2/3 of the segment, let's say, Central Labs. And that's really where the backlog, if you will, the book-to-bill is probably more applicable because the backlog that we have in Central Lab is effectively supporting most of the revenues over the next 12 months. So to your point on visibility with early development, we have less visibility because it's a much lower percentage of the backlog with that business and much shorter lead times. So it just puts in a little bit more volatility, if you will.\n But on a positive side, as we ultimately see the rebound in that business, we'll be able to get those revenues and bring them into revenues on a quicker basis than we could have within Central Labs. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. \nUnknown Analyst: Maybe just one quick clarification on Invitae. You talked about the financial impact in the first full year post close. Is there any financial impact currently embedded in the guidance? \nGlenn Eisenberg: So Michael, this is Glenn. When you look at the guidance that we've given, and we always kind of say the midpoint of the range is what our expectation is, and then there's always going to be pluses and minuses, which is why we put a range. So at the midpoint of our guidance, the answer is Invitae is not in those numbers.\n But when you look at the guidance range, so relative to the revenues of Invitae or the potential dilution in the first year, that would be incorporated, if you will, sizing it within the range we've given. So I guess the answer is it's not in the explicit guidance, but it's captured within the range that we've provided. We're looking to close this and it will obviously depend when we do, but let's say it's in the third quarter. Obviously, when we have our announcement of our quarterly call, we will update our guidance to reflect, obviously, a half a year left. But obviously, acquisitions that would have been completed as well which, again, we may see Invitae over that time frame. \nUnknown Analyst: Okay. That's helpful, Glenn. And then maybe just on price and rev per rec. Can you just give us a sense on how it tracked over the quarter relative to your expectations? And in terms of the Base Business guidance increase for the Diagnostic Laboratories business, how much of that is the difference between improvements in volume versus improvements in price? \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So overall, we normally talk about our growth weighted to volume versus price mix and kind of 3:1 ratio, if you will. Obviously, it was a little different during the quarter, but strength, frankly, on both volume and on price mix. The price/mix frankly is mix related. We would normally say unit price is relatively flat. But the improvement that we saw in the quarter from a mix standpoint was the live management agreements, was the -- our test per session.\n We continue to see favorable movement and we're seeing a higher percent of our growth coming from our esoteric business versus routine. So all those three kind of improved our mix. But clearly, the growth that we expect to see is driven off of demand, which is volume. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. \nAnn Hynes: So I just want to talk about just the volume and obviously, the Diagnostics segment is very strong. And it's in line with what your largest period as reported. And I'm just -- I'm trying to figure out like how much is driven by underlying demand, which is strong, but also how much is driven by maybe the national companies taking market share? And if you are taking market share, who are you taking it from? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So and I'll give you -- broadly speaking, and then maybe Glenn can add some details. But broadly speaking, if you look at the hospital deals that we're doing, there's a significant number of them that we had last year, at the end of the quarter, going into this year. And when you do those, those are, by definition, getting some market share. And then when you think about what's happening in the marketplace around those hospitals, you expect that you'll pick up some market share there as well.\n So I think a lot of it is that the market is strong. You're seeing a lot more people getting procedures and so forth. But in addition to that, I think there is some share gains that you're seeing because of what we're doing and the strength that we have in the hospital market sector. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is just that we had a good quarter, and we took our full year outlook up to reflecting the stronger demand than we've been seeing. We also look back to pre-pandemic, and we're tracking well within the range that we would normally expect to be. So some of the year-over-year improvement arguably has driven a bit about and not fully recovered year -- the prior year. But to see that kind of growth, we feel very good about and expect that to continue. \nAnn Hynes: All right. And then secondly, heading into the final LDT rules from the FDA, what is LabCorp looking? Like what are the key things we should look for that you won't change in the final rule? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So the first thing I'd say is that the LabCorp was supportive of the Valid Act, which we thought was the right way to provide oversight of the FDA of LDTs. It was legislation that was fit for purpose for our industry. We're not supportive of the current rule, although we haven't seen the final rule. We still have to see that in a whole judgment until we see exactly what's in there. What I worry about most -- and we have great quality organization. We have terrific scientists, and we do so many -- so much research and need to [indiscernible] marketplace. What I worry about is speed to market of LDTs. And patients that need these LDTs, they're typically smaller groups of patients. Other people aren't necessarily developing tests for them and they need to test as quickly as possible. \n So the real question to me is going to be how fast the FDA will be able to review the new LDTs and get them into the marketplace. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. \nElizabeth Anderson: I was wondering if you could comment on the pacing of the lab management deal integration.  Anything to pick up on proceeding as sort of as you guys thought, any learnings you would say in terms of others as you continue on that path? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So we've gotten quite good at being able to efficiently and effectively run the lab management agreements that we have. When you do 100 hospitals with one organization quickly, you become an expert pretty fast. So what I would say is we take our time because the most important thing is to ensure that there's no patient disruption. The second thing is to make sure that the physicians are very satisfied with the way in which they can order and the speed in which they get their results. And then over time, we find ways to use our size, our scale and our ability to synergize to reduce cost. And we've learned that the most important thing is to do it really well. And although the margins never get to our average margins, they start off low and they increase over time. I think you've seen with the announcement of several deals closing in the first quarter, multiple deals closing at the end of last year. There's a slight impact on our margin in the beginning. But over time, the margin is going to improve. And that's why we believe our Diagnostics margin will increase when you look at the totality of '24 versus '23. \nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. That's helpful. Anything you can comment to in the early development business about sort of non NHP growth? Because I just wanted to like sort that out in terms of the impact on the revenues in the quarter. \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So what I would say is that there's no longer a supply issue with NHP. The only thing that we're seeing with NHP is a bit of a revenue drag because the cost of NHPs when there was a supply issue were much higher. We were charging the higher price, but we weren't making a margin on that higher price. So now that the prices have come down, the actual revenue for those studies come down with the price. So you're seeing less revenue growth in that area, which I would say is probably a bit artificial because of the price of the NHPs coming down. \nElizabeth Anderson: Yes, that makes sense. I just wanted to sort of understand that versus the dynamics in the non-NHP portion of the business. \nAdam Schechter: Yes. I would say that dynamics in the non-NHP portion you're seeing growth rates that would be a bit higher than the NHP. But again, that's more -- they're both less than what we have seen historically because of what's happening in the biotech world. We are beginning to see signs of recovery in the biotech world. So both of those parts of the business should recover over time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. \nKevin Caliendo: I want to talk or ask a little bit about... \nAdam Schechter: Kevin, we can't hear you. You're breaking up pretty significantly. \nKevin Caliendo: I'm sorry, is it better? \nAdam Schechter: No. \nKevin Caliendo: I'll try to ask you again, why don't you talk a little bit about margin expectations in the DX segment, specifically around your expectation of labor trends and actual margin in the DX business going forward, like in the first quarter as we're jumping off [indiscernible]. \nAdam Schechter: Yes. Are you talking margins in CLS or Diagnostics? I couldn't tell. \nKevin Caliendo: Diagnostics, sorry. \nAdam Schechter: Okay, in Diagnostics. What I would say is that if you look at the Diagnostics business, the business performed very well. We had basically 7% growth in the Base Business and volume was good at almost 5%. The margin was down versus prior year was driven by three things. It was driven by COVID. There was some impact from weather. And as I previously mentioned, there was some impact from the lab management agreements as we begin to roll those out in the fourth quarter of last year, so in the first quarter, we'll see the margins get better as we go through the year. Overall, we expect the diagnostic margins in '24 to be higher than the margins in '23. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add too is, as Adam said, margins up even despite COVID and weather and lab management agreements for the full year margins to be up slightly but also to see that expected beginning in the second quarter where you'll see nice growth year-over-year. We'll have the normal seasonality. So when you look at the absolute margins, they'll fluctuate based on seasonality, but the year-over-year improvement, you'll see pick up nicely beginning in the second quarter that gives us the confidence that the margins will be up for the full year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. \nAndrew Brackmann: Maybe just to piggyback off some of those margin questions on the Diagnostics front, but more specifically on the specialty diagnostics side of things. I guess, how should we be thinking about moving, the moving pieces there moving forward? Obviously, you gave some color around Invitae, but just as that entire specialty business grows, how are you thinking about its impact on total segment margins here? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So the first thing I would say is as we look at the businesses, they're both strong right now are routine testing as well as our specialty testing. We are seeing the specialty testing grow at a slightly accelerated rate versus the routine testing, but routine testing is still the vast majority of the business that we do. A big part of the reason that specialty testing is important is, number one, they're typically very serious diseases. Number two, when people get specialty testing, they get a lot of routine tests around those specialty tests as well.\n And then third of all, they typically or show how strong you are in science and innovation, and it's got a good kind of overhang of the company because we are a scientifically based organization. So for those three reasons, you'll see specialty testing growing faster than routine testing, but routine tends to go with the specialty testing to some degree. \nAndrew Brackmann: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe a little bit unrelated, but as it relates to your Alzheimer's portfolio more specifically. Can you maybe just give us a sense of the current scale for that business today? And I guess, as you think in longer term here, just can you talk about the market opportunity that you see in that segment moving forward? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. What I would say right now, it's not a large part of our business. It's a very small part of our business. But it's an important part because there are new therapies that we believe will become available over time, it's such an important disease and it's growing in the United States and around the world. So we want to have the broadest portfolio for physicians to use to help with the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's patients. But once again, many of those patients not only need these Alzheimer's tests, but they'll use a lot of routine tests as they learn to diagnose these patients and monitor them over time.\n I would expect, over time, that market will grow, those tests will grow, but I think it will be to some degree, commensurate with how fast the overall prescription drug market grows because when diagnosed, the physicians also want to know what can I do about that. And what should I do about that. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. \nEric Coldwell: It's going to be an embarrassing question when you're afraid to ask it. But on the NHP and the pricing comments, I'm curious if you could give us any more detail on where your pricing is today, what it looks like going forward versus the recent past? One of your smaller competitors recently shared with the Street that it saw pricing down about 18% versus last quarter. I'm curious if you could frame it for you. And then I believe at the top of the market, NHP was about half of your early development work in total. I'm curious if you could give us a sense of what that mix looks like today. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. Eric, with regard to NHP pricing, we've not given what the step down in the pricing has been. And obviously, it impacts the mix and where we get the [ primates ] from and where they're used in the studies. What we've commented is that it's been a nice reduction in the price from when we were capacity constrained and obviously, the prices were significantly higher. And I think Adam referenced this earlier as well that from our perspective, while it impacts our revenues, it's really not impacting our profitability because most of the step down in the price of NHPs were pass-through. So the positive is it shows us a lower cost for our customers to get their studies done. So they're seeing the benefit of it without a negative impact from us overall. To your point, roughly half of the studies that we do are in HP based with the other half that are not, that mix really hasn't changed very much. \nEric Coldwell: Thanks, Glenn. I appreciate that. Just maybe another macro question. The HLM deals come in at a lower margin, as you've always said, and you've done a flurry of them here recently and then the very big deal with Ascension. I know you're talking about improvements as you integrate and get those onboarded each over the next year each time. But could you give us an update on where Ascension is at this point, kind of the journey on that contract from the beginning to the present and how it's stacking up on a margin profile and possibly also a revenue profile versus your original expectations? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. I'll let Glenn answer that question, Eric, but before you guys, I think it's important to note that no two hospital deals are exactly the same, and it really it's three pieces to them, right? There's a lab management part where you run a hospital's labs. There's the outreach business and there's the referral business. Ascension was kind of an outlier to most of the deals that we do because so much of it was the lab management part of the business, and that has by far the lowest margin that starts out low and improves over time.  Most of the deals that we do, they start out with a lower margin. But overall, with the kind of portfolio of the three types of business, they get to about or average margins over time. So that's the typical deal. Ascension is a bit of an outlier, but maybe you can talk about Ascension, Glenn. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. No. I think that's right, especially given the size of the transaction overall, let alone the percentage that was live management. But we normally, and Ascension was a good example. Let's say, would be starting a mid-single-digit kind of margin, obviously, mixing us down that we've talked about. And then we normally see the margin step up over the years with that one, while we expect to see a step up, probably not as strong in just the second year of ownership as relative to others is we continue to share on a value basis, if you will, some of the synergies and the savings that we get, we're obviously passing on to that our large partner there and thereafter starting to see the step up. So positive direction, but we'll see more of an incremental improvement next year. \nAdam Schechter: And the revenue for that looks very strong. It's slightly above what we had guided to originally. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. \nJohn Kim: This is John Kim on for Mike. So you've done a lot of deals. You have Invitae, BioReference and the 3 health system agreements that you closed in the first quarter. And Glenn, you talked about how, given the range that Invitae would be included in the top end of the guidance. So could you just update us on your thoughts on the deal funnel and your capital allocation priority, are there any other larger deals, independent labs or health systems that are still coming our way? \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. So when you think about -- to your point, the transactions that we've done this year and as we commented, embedded in our guidance is the assumption that we'll use our free cash flow for acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We have been -- this has been a good year for M&A. We've always talked about that we've had a strong pipeline of deals, and we're seeing them come to fruition this year. \n But between the 3 deals that we closed in the first quarter the announcement of BioReference and Invitae, you're looking from an M&A standpoint over $700 million of capital allocated to M&A this year. And then you put that with the dividends, you're getting closer to $1 billion. So on the positive side, we had a strong balance sheet. So another $100 million of call it, free cash flow-ish that will be used between M&A and share repurchases. \n But we're currently leveraged at around 2.5x debt-to-trailing 12 months EBITDA, and we're at the low end of 2.5x, and we give a targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. So within that, call it, 0.5 point on a, call it, a $2 billion plus EBITDA basis, we have another $1 billion of capacity. So we'll still have a lot of financial flexibility to do share repurchases, to do tuck-in acquisitions that we feel are strategic, but we feel very good about the deals that we've announced this year. Obviously, we'll spend a lot of time integrating them into the company, but we have the -- obviously, the financial flexibility as well as still a good pipeline of potential opportunities on the deal front going forward. \nJohn Kim: Got it. I appreciate that. And if I could ask one on the Biopharma early development. So you talked about the cancellations coming down still a little high. But I wanted to ask, you previously talked about targeting perhaps medium-sized clients. Any -- has there been any shift or your win rates are good and at least in the Central Labs, has there been any shift in that direction in terms of garnering attention or RFP from the medium-size clients? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So we're trying to improve our mix to more larger to medium-sized clients. It takes some time because many of those clients have master service agreements and you have to wait for us to expire or find ways to be part of those. But over time, I'm confident that we'll continue to shift the mix more towards the medium to larger size pharma. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. \nBrian Tanquilut: I guess my question for you guys. In the past, as we thought about hospital lab acquisitions and outsourcing contracts, the distress in the space or the pressures in the hospitals was one of the driving factors. So as we're seeing broad utilization pickup in the hospital industry health seems to be improving. Adam, have the conversations changed? Or what does that pipeline look like today? And yes, just curious what those dynamics are and how they're playing into future deals and agreements with hospitals? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. No, it's a good question, Brian. And it's good news that the systems are doing better and that the hospitals are performing better. I think that's good for all of health care, frankly. So I'm pleased that they are beginning to rebound and do better. The interesting thing was before the issues with the health systems, a lot of the discussion was can you do it and can you do it well? And should we take the risk that things aren't going to go well.\n Because we've done so many -- in so many large institutions, I don't think people have that question anymore. They realize that we are really good at this, that we can manage it better than they probably can by themselves that we'll have no physician interruption or patient interruption of note. So therefore, they're willing to look and talk to us about continuing to do these deals. Now I think there was a sense of urgency that caused these deals to move quicker in the past. So I'm not quite sure the sense of urgency is there as much as it was before. But the number of discussions and the types of discussions we're having remain very good. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. \nKieran Ryan: You've got Kieran Ryan on for Pito. I noticed you didn't touch on waiver when discussing the diagnostic margin drivers. I think one of your peers cited some modest improvement in the environment. So can you just give us an update on what you're seeing on labor as it relates to things like wage growth and turnover? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So I'll start with turnover. And I'll give a sense, overall, across LabCorp, our turnover is better now than it was last year or the year before that. In our Biopharma business, I'd say it's back to pre-COVID levels, maybe even a little bit better. So the turnover there has really improved. In our Diagnostics, we see in certain areas, there's still a higher turnover than what we would have seen prior to the pandemic, particularly in frontline employees, where they have not only other choices in health care, but in other industries. But even there, we start to see less turnover than what we've seen in the past. There's been a significant inflation of cost due to retaining employees in the past as we go forward, I think it will move back more towards the level of inflation of about 3% or so. \nKieran Ryan: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. The prior question was kind of talking about the strong demand that hospitals and some providers you're seeing now. I was just wondering, does the top line guide in Diagnostics at all contemplate a normalization in kind of broader utilization? Or are you just really not seeing anything outside of what you'd expect at this point? \nAdam Schechter: Yes. I would say that we're seeing what we would expect at this point is slightly higher, we give a range because there's a range of different things that may or may not occur. But overall, we think that the environment is healthy. \nGlenn Eisenberg: Yes. When you look at the -- also, I guess, our implied guidance, so you're looking at a stronger top line growth than what we did in the first quarter with our guidance, but that's just really driven off of COVID becoming less of an issue. It was a bigger issue in the first quarter decline year-on-year, plus that's where we had the adverse impact from weather. So really when you adjust for that, as Adam's commented, the demand that we're seeing, which is came in a little bit stronger than we expected. We expect that to be similar demand going forward throughout the rest of the year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. \nStephanie Davis: I feel bad asking about early development because I said we're all focusing on this as a really small part of your business. But I have to ask because you did talk about some risk of potential share shifts when I saw you in March. So I think about the cut, is this more a function of higher for longer environment that could be impacting biotech funding? Is it something defensive early on, just in case maybe there are some potential share shifts. And how do we think about the underlying assumptions in terms of how they may have changed in use on cancellations and biotech funding in order to kind of enter new numbers. \nAdam Schechter: Yes. So as I think about the early development business, I don't think that it's a share shifting. I think our share is remaining consistent within the parts of the market that we compete, we don't compete in all aspects of our -- we don't have a contract manufacturing organization, for example. But in the areas that we compete. Our win rates look good, our RFPs look good. So I believe that our market share is being maintained. I think we're seeing more that there's still a higher level of cancellations than what we've seen in the past. And in some instances, it's taking a bit longer for the companies to make their final decisions because they're still managing what I would say is a rather restricted budget even with the funding being better than it has been before.\n So the good news is central laboratory, which is by far the largest part of that business remains very strong. and we continue to expect it to be strong, and it's offsetting the weakness that we continue to see in ED that could go on for a bit longer. But even if it does, we feel that the strength that we're seeing in the largest part of the business offsets that. \nOperator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn it back to Adam Schechter for closing remarks. \nAdam Schechter: I want to thank you all for joining us today. And hopefully, you can see we continue to advance our strategy and make significant progress, and we're going to continue our mission to improve health and improve lives around the world. Hope everybody has a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adam Schechter",
            "content": "Thank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2024 results and progress on our strategy. But before I do that, I want to address the recent announcement that LabCorp was selected as the winning bidder for select assets of Invitae.\n This transaction will advance our strategy to launch and scale specialty testing in areas such as oncology and rare diseases. These are strong assets in important disease areas, and they fit strategically with our focus on specialty testing. Invitae has strong science, a great NGS platform and strong talent. Upon completion of the transaction, LabCorp expects approximately $275 million to $300 million in annual revenue, with the vast majority in specialty areas, such as oncology and rare diseases.  \n The purchase price for the transaction is $239 million. We expect the transaction to be dilutive to adjusted earnings by approximately 2% to 3% in the first full year. We expect the transaction to be accretive in year 2 and to exceed our cost of capital in year 3.\n Now I'll move to the quarter. LabCorp delivered strong top line performance in the first quarter driven by growth in both of our businesses, Diagnostic Laboratories and Biopharma Laboratory Services. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities through being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories through launching key new tests in important therapeutic areas and by harnessing science, technology and innovation to bring new tests, services and capabilities to our customers around the world.\n Let's turn now to our first quarter financial results. In the first quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $3.68. Enterprise revenue for the quarter increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with Diagnostics revenue up 4% and Biopharma revenue up 8%. Biopharma's growth was driven by strength in central laboratories, partially offset by early development research laboratories. Enterprise-based business margins are up compared to the prior year. Higher margins in Biopharma were partially offset by Diagnostics margins. We expect margins in both businesses to be up for the full year. The overall strength in our business enabled us to narrow the range and raised the midpoint of our EPS full year guidance to $14.90 despite a negative impact from currency.\n Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 outlook in just a moment. In the first quarter, LabCorp advanced key growth initiatives that support our strategy. We began 2024 with positive momentum, reinforcing our position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. We continue to be active on the acquisition front.\n We closed three transactions in March, including health system agreements with Baystate Health in Massachusetts and Providence in California and a regional lab acquisition in California. In March, we also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of BioReference Health's diagnostic business. This transaction will increase access to LabCorp's high-quality clinical laboratory services.\n These new assets are focused on clinical diagnostics and reproductive and women's health. Our business development pipeline remains strong. Building on the success of our acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we continue to incorporate the power of science, technology and innovation across the organization. This commitment is demonstrated by how we've expanded our test menu this quarter. We advanced our leadership in neurodegenerative disease with the launch of pTau217 blood-based biomarker test that aids in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the monitoring of patients undergoing treatment with new therapies.\n It's also available to be used in clinical trials. In addition, earlier this month, we announced the launch of our GFAP blood biomarker test for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological injuries. Following the launch of our ATN profile last fall, these two significant advances in the company's testing portfolio extend our leadership in a rapidly accelerating field of blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.\n We continue to accelerate our leadership in oncology. We launched LabCorp plasma detect, the first clinically validated whole genome sequencing MRD solution for early-stage colon cancer to identify patients at increased risk of reoccurrence after surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy. LabCorp plasma detect developed by our PGDx laboratory is a significant achievement that enhances our liquid biopsy portfolio and strengthens our position at the forefront of driving better patient outcomes in oncology.\n We introduced a weight loss management test portfolio in the quarter, a suite of tests that supports individuals and physicians with accessible and convenient testing options to guide weight loss management decisions and treatment, including lifestyle modifications, GLP-1 medications or bariatric surgery. LabCorp OnDemand introduced a magnesium test and a micronutrient test to measure key vitamin and mineral levels to support individual wellness. We also announced an STI pass for Mgen. Mgen can be as widespread as chlamydia and gonorrhea. This test includes a reflex to identify resistance to macrolides, a commonly used treatment addressing high antibiotic resistance and treatment failures associated with the infection.\n In April, we received emergency use authorization from the FDA for our Mpox PCR test, a home collection kit. The test is the first at-home collection kit authorized by the FDA to aid in the diagnosis of infection with Mpox. Physicians can order for patients 18 years of age or older who are suspected of Mpox infection. In addition, we launched our electronic requisition digital capability to help Biopharma customers and investigator sites, improve protocol compliance by reducing errors, queries, holes and data revisions. \n Earlier this month, we released our latest corporate responsibility report, which highlights the significant progress that we're making as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives in a sustainable way. \n We invite you to take some time to review the report that can be found on our Investor Relations website. As part of our earnings release this morning, we also announced our intention to create a new holding company named LabCorp Holdings Inc. to more closely align with our brand and better position us as a global organization. I'd like to thank our team of more than 67,000 employees around the world. Their ongoing commitment has once again earned us recognition of Fortune's World's most Admired Companies list. We're extremely proud of this recognition.\n In summary, we continue to make progress against our strategy and to achieving both near-term and longer-term goals. We remain focused on our position as leaders in science, technology and innovation, and driving further value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn. Yes, Jack, so they're strong assets. And we've always said that oncology is one of our core therapeutic areas, and they have a very big hereditary oncology business, much bigger than the business that we have in that area. So it certainly augments what we're doing and it accelerates it in a fairly significant way. They also have quite a bit of rare disease work that they've done, and that augments our focus on specialty testing.\n They have a very good NGS platform. We have a platform, but we're going to look to see what we can use that they have and use what we have and get the best platform we can possibly get. They have very good talent. And I think we're able to do it at a reasonable deal. It's a company that people have looked at for years and years that their valuation you could never get past. But the science was always very good. Their capabilities were always very good. So strategic that feel fits very well for us. Yes. So I'll start overall and then I'll answer early development specifically, Erin. So overall, Biopharma Laboratory Services grew 8% and Central Labs had very strong growth at 13%. Now realizing Central Labs had a relatively easy compare versus first quarter of last year. You probably remember in first quarter of last year, there were a lot of personnel issues at investigator sites. If you look at the ED growth, it's coming back slower than we anticipated, but it's being offset by the strength in our Central Lab business.\n If you look at RFP flow, for Central Lab, everything looks normal, everything looks really strong. That business is very healthy. If you look at early development, we still continue to have good RFP flow. The win rates are good.  The cancellations still remain higher than what we would expect. The first quarter was a bit better than fourth quarter of last year, but still higher than what we anticipate. So as we go through the rest of the year, we were able to maintain the revenue guidance for BLS, if you just adjust only for foreign exchange where Central Labs is going to continue to outperform, and we expect it's going to take a bit longer for the early development business to fully come back. Sure. So I'll start with the book-to-bill. So the book-to-bill was 1.0 that's lower than we would typically like. However, we've got insight to the book-to-bill for second quarter already and insight to the rest of the year. And I expect the book-to-bill to continue to grow starting next quarter throughout the rest of the year. The health of the book-to-bill still looks good across the business. It's an early development part of the book-to-bill, which frankly, is a little bit less relevant because early development, a lot of the studies start in the year and finish in the year. Typically with the book-to-bill, you look for things that go more than a year or over time.\n So as I look at the early development book-to-bill, it's not where we would like it at the moment, but the RFPs are good. The win rate looks good. It's the cancellations that are driving the majority of the issues. But that can correct itself faster typically because the burn rate is so much quicker. As we go through the rest of the year, we expect that the early development business starting in the second half will begin to be stronger than the first half. Yes. So and I'll give you -- broadly speaking, and then maybe Glenn can add some details. But broadly speaking, if you look at the hospital deals that we're doing, there's a significant number of them that we had last year, at the end of the quarter, going into this year. And when you do those, those are, by definition, getting some market share. And then when you think about what's happening in the marketplace around those hospitals, you expect that you'll pick up some market share there as well.\n So I think a lot of it is that the market is strong. You're seeing a lot more people getting procedures and so forth. But in addition to that, I think there is some share gains that you're seeing because of what we're doing and the strength that we have in the hospital market sector. Yes. So the first thing I'd say is that the LabCorp was supportive of the Valid Act, which we thought was the right way to provide oversight of the FDA of LDTs. It was legislation that was fit for purpose for our industry. We're not supportive of the current rule, although we haven't seen the final rule. We still have to see that in a whole judgment until we see exactly what's in there. What I worry about most -- and we have great quality organization. We have terrific scientists, and we do so many -- so much research and need to [indiscernible] marketplace. What I worry about is speed to market of LDTs. And patients that need these LDTs, they're typically smaller groups of patients. Other people aren't necessarily developing tests for them and they need to test as quickly as possible. \n So the real question to me is going to be how fast the FDA will be able to review the new LDTs and get them into the marketplace. Yes. So we've gotten quite good at being able to efficiently and effectively run the lab management agreements that we have. When you do 100 hospitals with one organization quickly, you become an expert pretty fast. So what I would say is we take our time because the most important thing is to ensure that there's no patient disruption. The second thing is to make sure that the physicians are very satisfied with the way in which they can order and the speed in which they get their results. And then over time, we find ways to use our size, our scale and our ability to synergize to reduce cost. And we've learned that the most important thing is to do it really well. And although the margins never get to our average margins, they start off low and they increase over time. I think you've seen with the announcement of several deals closing in the first quarter, multiple deals closing at the end of last year. There's a slight impact on our margin in the beginning. But over time, the margin is going to improve. And that's why we believe our Diagnostics margin will increase when you look at the totality of '24 versus '23. Yes. So what I would say is that there's no longer a supply issue with NHP. The only thing that we're seeing with NHP is a bit of a revenue drag because the cost of NHPs when there was a supply issue were much higher. We were charging the higher price, but we weren't making a margin on that higher price. So now that the prices have come down, the actual revenue for those studies come down with the price. So you're seeing less revenue growth in that area, which I would say is probably a bit artificial because of the price of the NHPs coming down. Yes. I would say that dynamics in the non-NHP portion you're seeing growth rates that would be a bit higher than the NHP. But again, that's more -- they're both less than what we have seen historically because of what's happening in the biotech world. We are beginning to see signs of recovery in the biotech world. So both of those parts of the business should recover over time. Kevin, we can't hear you. You're breaking up pretty significantly. No. Yes. Are you talking margins in CLS or Diagnostics? I couldn't tell. Okay, in Diagnostics. What I would say is that if you look at the Diagnostics business, the business performed very well. We had basically 7% growth in the Base Business and volume was good at almost 5%. The margin was down versus prior year was driven by three things. It was driven by COVID. There was some impact from weather. And as I previously mentioned, there was some impact from the lab management agreements as we begin to roll those out in the fourth quarter of last year, so in the first quarter, we'll see the margins get better as we go through the year. Overall, we expect the diagnostic margins in '24 to be higher than the margins in '23. Yes. So the first thing I would say is as we look at the businesses, they're both strong right now are routine testing as well as our specialty testing. We are seeing the specialty testing grow at a slightly accelerated rate versus the routine testing, but routine testing is still the vast majority of the business that we do. A big part of the reason that specialty testing is important is, number one, they're typically very serious diseases. Number two, when people get specialty testing, they get a lot of routine tests around those specialty tests as well.\n And then third of all, they typically or show how strong you are in science and innovation, and it's got a good kind of overhang of the company because we are a scientifically based organization. So for those three reasons, you'll see specialty testing growing faster than routine testing, but routine tends to go with the specialty testing to some degree. Yes. What I would say right now, it's not a large part of our business. It's a very small part of our business. But it's an important part because there are new therapies that we believe will become available over time, it's such an important disease and it's growing in the United States and around the world. So we want to have the broadest portfolio for physicians to use to help with the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's patients. But once again, many of those patients not only need these Alzheimer's tests, but they'll use a lot of routine tests as they learn to diagnose these patients and monitor them over time.\n I would expect, over time, that market will grow, those tests will grow, but I think it will be to some degree, commensurate with how fast the overall prescription drug market grows because when diagnosed, the physicians also want to know what can I do about that. And what should I do about that. Yes. I'll let Glenn answer that question, Eric, but before you guys, I think it's important to note that no two hospital deals are exactly the same, and it really it's three pieces to them, right? There's a lab management part where you run a hospital's labs. There's the outreach business and there's the referral business. Ascension was kind of an outlier to most of the deals that we do because so much of it was the lab management part of the business, and that has by far the lowest margin that starts out low and improves over time.  Most of the deals that we do, they start out with a lower margin. But overall, with the kind of portfolio of the three types of business, they get to about or average margins over time. So that's the typical deal. Ascension is a bit of an outlier, but maybe you can talk about Ascension, Glenn. And the revenue for that looks very strong. It's slightly above what we had guided to originally. Yes. So we're trying to improve our mix to more larger to medium-sized clients. It takes some time because many of those clients have master service agreements and you have to wait for us to expire or find ways to be part of those. But over time, I'm confident that we'll continue to shift the mix more towards the medium to larger size pharma. Yes. No, it's a good question, Brian. And it's good news that the systems are doing better and that the hospitals are performing better. I think that's good for all of health care, frankly. So I'm pleased that they are beginning to rebound and do better. The interesting thing was before the issues with the health systems, a lot of the discussion was can you do it and can you do it well? And should we take the risk that things aren't going to go well.\n Because we've done so many -- in so many large institutions, I don't think people have that question anymore. They realize that we are really good at this, that we can manage it better than they probably can by themselves that we'll have no physician interruption or patient interruption of note. So therefore, they're willing to look and talk to us about continuing to do these deals. Now I think there was a sense of urgency that caused these deals to move quicker in the past. So I'm not quite sure the sense of urgency is there as much as it was before. But the number of discussions and the types of discussions we're having remain very good. Yes. So I'll start with turnover. And I'll give a sense, overall, across LabCorp, our turnover is better now than it was last year or the year before that. In our Biopharma business, I'd say it's back to pre-COVID levels, maybe even a little bit better. So the turnover there has really improved. In our Diagnostics, we see in certain areas, there's still a higher turnover than what we would have seen prior to the pandemic, particularly in frontline employees, where they have not only other choices in health care, but in other industries. But even there, we start to see less turnover than what we've seen in the past. There's been a significant inflation of cost due to retaining employees in the past as we go forward, I think it will move back more towards the level of inflation of about 3% or so. Yes. I would say that we're seeing what we would expect at this point is slightly higher, we give a range because there's a range of different things that may or may not occur. But overall, we think that the environment is healthy. Yes. So as I think about the early development business, I don't think that it's a share shifting. I think our share is remaining consistent within the parts of the market that we compete, we don't compete in all aspects of our -- we don't have a contract manufacturing organization, for example. But in the areas that we compete. Our win rates look good, our RFPs look good. So I believe that our market share is being maintained. I think we're seeing more that there's still a higher level of cancellations than what we've seen in the past. And in some instances, it's taking a bit longer for the companies to make their final decisions because they're still managing what I would say is a rather restricted budget even with the funding being better than it has been before.\n So the good news is central laboratory, which is by far the largest part of that business remains very strong. and we continue to expect it to be strong, and it's offsetting the weakness that we continue to see in ED that could go on for a bit longer. But even if it does, we feel that the strength that we're seeing in the largest part of the business offsets that. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And hopefully, you can see we continue to advance our strategy and make significant progress, and we're going to continue our mission to improve health and improve lives around the world. Hope everybody has a good day."

            "name": "Glenn Eisenberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\n Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4.6% compared to last year. Primarily due to organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The Base Business grew 6.7% compared to the Base Business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 70%. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 4.3%. Operating income for the quarter was $321 million, 10.1% of revenue or 14.3% on an adjusted basis.\n During the quarter, we had $49 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $22 million of expense for transition service agreements related to the spin of Fortrea, with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $60 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $453 million or 14.3% of revenue compared to $448 million or 14.7% last year.\n The margin decline was due to lower COVID testing. Base Business margins were up as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 22.1% last year.\n The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to a stock-based compensation benefit in the prior year. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $228 million or $2.69 per diluted share.\n Adjusted EPS were $3.68 in the quarter, up 7% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was a use of $30 million in the quarter compared to $186 million generated a year ago. The reduction in cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, primarily related to deferred taxes and the timing of working capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $134 million in the quarter or 4.2% of revenue.\n This compares to $78 million or 2.6% in the prior year, which was impacted by the pending spin of Fortrea. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was a use of $164 million. The first quarter is seasonally the company's lowest quarter for free cash flow.\n We continue to expect free cash flow for the full year to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion. During the quarter, the company invested $259 million in acquisitions and paid out $62 million in dividends. At quarter end, we had $99 million in cash, while debt was $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.5x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\n Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 4.1% compared to last year, with organic growth of 1.8% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 2.2%. The Base Business grew 6.8% compared to the Base Business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 70%. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 4.4%.\n Total volume increased 3.4% compared to last year. Base Business volume grew 4.9% compared to the Base Business last year as organic volume increased 2.7%, while acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Price/mix increased 0.6% versus last year due to an organic base business increase that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base Business organic price/mix was up 1.7% compared to the base business last year.\n Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $418 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to [ $442 ] million or 18.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID testing,  while Base Business income was up as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. The decrease in adjusted operating income margin was due to the reduction in COVID testing, the negative impact from weather and the mix impact from lab management agreements, which we expect to improve over time.\n Now I'll review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $711 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 5.1% and foreign currency translation of 2.4%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 13%, while early development was down 4% due to continued higher-than-normal cancellations and lower orders. While cancellations are higher than normal, we have seen a sequential improvement from last quarter.\n Biopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $100 million or 14.1% of revenue compared to $74 million or 11.1% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.9 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.00, which we expect to increase throughout the year.\n Now I'll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 4.8% to 6.4% compared to 2023.\n Compared to prior guidance, this is a narrowing of the range with the same midpoint despite a 50 basis point headwind from currency. We continue to perform well in diagnostics and are narrowing the full year guidance range and increasing the midpoint. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 4.8% to 6% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 140 basis points, primarily due to stronger base business demand as well as acquisition revenue that is now forecasted in this segment, where it was previously only included in the enterprise guidance prior to the closing of the transactions.\n We expect Biopharma revenue to grow 3.7% to 5.7% compared to 2023. The decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 180 basis points is due to currency. This guidance includes the year-over-year positive from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points versus 220 basis points in the prior guidance. An improvement in the outlook for Central Labs is expected to be offset by early development. We continue to expect margins in Diagnostics and Biopharma to be up in 2024 versus 2023, driven by top line growth and LaunchPad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.45 to $15.35. \n We have narrowed the range and increased the midpoint of guidance by $0.05, driven by improvement in Diagnostics, partially offset by the change in currency. The free cash flow guidance range is $1 billion to $1.15 billion, unchanged from prior guidance. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\n Operator, we will now take questions. Yes, Jack. So again, as Adam commented, we're very excited about the acquisition. And frankly, going out of acquiring the select assets through bankruptcy from a purchase price, obviously, relative to other deals that we see of similar focus in our therapeutic areas is quite attractive. As we think about long-term value creation, you heard in the opening comments that we expect this to exceed our cost of capital in year 3 and have a very attractive overall return on our investment.\n But to your point, in the near term, it will be dilutive. This is a business that has a high cost structure. And from our perspective, like other acquisitions that we've done of similar ilk we'll be able to leverage the cost structure within LabCorp to leverage. It's a business that has a very high gross margin, which is, again, very attractive to us. Obviously, we'll continue to instill LaunchPad disciplines that we have which will benefit them as well. But the big opportunity to improve their profitability is on the cost side. They spend a fair amount in R&D, which we would expect to continue. Obviously, the value of what we're acquiring. But from sales, marketing and especially general administrative costs, where we can leverage our infrastructure we'll be able to get it profitable, as Adam said, within the first year. So it's all about integration. We'll do it on a very disciplined and timely manner, but we expect it to ultimately be accretive in the second full year of our ownership. When we talk about the 3 acquisitions that we announced in the quarter, that's adding obviously to the change in the guidance we did for diagnostics. So when you look at the change, just use the midpoint of our guidance, it improved 140 basis points, I assume roughly half of that is from those 3 acquisitions.\n And again, those were already incorporated in our enterprise guidance but not until the segment, until the deals were closed. So half of it is due to the acquisitions, and then the other half of the growth is demand. The strength that we saw in the first quarter that we also expect to see continued through the year. Yes. The only thing I'd add too, Patrick, is when you put the size of the business in perspective, obviously, it's less than 10% of the company. But even within Biopharma you have 2/3 of the segment, let's say, Central Labs. And that's really where the backlog, if you will, the book-to-bill is probably more applicable because the backlog that we have in Central Lab is effectively supporting most of the revenues over the next 12 months. So to your point on visibility with early development, we have less visibility because it's a much lower percentage of the backlog with that business and much shorter lead times. So it just puts in a little bit more volatility, if you will.\n But on a positive side, as we ultimately see the rebound in that business, we'll be able to get those revenues and bring them into revenues on a quicker basis than we could have within Central Labs. So Michael, this is Glenn. When you look at the guidance that we've given, and we always kind of say the midpoint of the range is what our expectation is, and then there's always going to be pluses and minuses, which is why we put a range. So at the midpoint of our guidance, the answer is Invitae is not in those numbers.\n But when you look at the guidance range, so relative to the revenues of Invitae or the potential dilution in the first year, that would be incorporated, if you will, sizing it within the range we've given. So I guess the answer is it's not in the explicit guidance, but it's captured within the range that we've provided. We're looking to close this and it will obviously depend when we do, but let's say it's in the third quarter. Obviously, when we have our announcement of our quarterly call, we will update our guidance to reflect, obviously, a half a year left. But obviously, acquisitions that would have been completed as well which, again, we may see Invitae over that time frame. Yes. So overall, we normally talk about our growth weighted to volume versus price mix and kind of 3:1 ratio, if you will. Obviously, it was a little different during the quarter, but strength, frankly, on both volume and on price mix. The price/mix frankly is mix related. We would normally say unit price is relatively flat. But the improvement that we saw in the quarter from a mix standpoint was the live management agreements, was the -- our test per session.\n We continue to see favorable movement and we're seeing a higher percent of our growth coming from our esoteric business versus routine. So all those three kind of improved our mix. But clearly, the growth that we expect to see is driven off of demand, which is volume. Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is just that we had a good quarter, and we took our full year outlook up to reflecting the stronger demand than we've been seeing. We also look back to pre-pandemic, and we're tracking well within the range that we would normally expect to be. So some of the year-over-year improvement arguably has driven a bit about and not fully recovered year -- the prior year. But to see that kind of growth, we feel very good about and expect that to continue. Yes. The only thing I'd add too is, as Adam said, margins up even despite COVID and weather and lab management agreements for the full year margins to be up slightly but also to see that expected beginning in the second quarter where you'll see nice growth year-over-year. We'll have the normal seasonality. So when you look at the absolute margins, they'll fluctuate based on seasonality, but the year-over-year improvement, you'll see pick up nicely beginning in the second quarter that gives us the confidence that the margins will be up for the full year. Yes. Eric, with regard to NHP pricing, we've not given what the step down in the pricing has been. And obviously, it impacts the mix and where we get the [ primates ] from and where they're used in the studies. What we've commented is that it's been a nice reduction in the price from when we were capacity constrained and obviously, the prices were significantly higher. And I think Adam referenced this earlier as well that from our perspective, while it impacts our revenues, it's really not impacting our profitability because most of the step down in the price of NHPs were pass-through. So the positive is it shows us a lower cost for our customers to get their studies done. So they're seeing the benefit of it without a negative impact from us overall. To your point, roughly half of the studies that we do are in HP based with the other half that are not, that mix really hasn't changed very much. Yes. No. I think that's right, especially given the size of the transaction overall, let alone the percentage that was live management. But we normally, and Ascension was a good example. Let's say, would be starting a mid-single-digit kind of margin, obviously, mixing us down that we've talked about. And then we normally see the margin step up over the years with that one, while we expect to see a step up, probably not as strong in just the second year of ownership as relative to others is we continue to share on a value basis, if you will, some of the synergies and the savings that we get, we're obviously passing on to that our large partner there and thereafter starting to see the step up. So positive direction, but we'll see more of an incremental improvement next year. Yes. So when you think about -- to your point, the transactions that we've done this year and as we commented, embedded in our guidance is the assumption that we'll use our free cash flow for acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. We have been -- this has been a good year for M&A. We've always talked about that we've had a strong pipeline of deals, and we're seeing them come to fruition this year. \n But between the 3 deals that we closed in the first quarter the announcement of BioReference and Invitae, you're looking from an M&A standpoint over $700 million of capital allocated to M&A this year. And then you put that with the dividends, you're getting closer to $1 billion. So on the positive side, we had a strong balance sheet. So another $100 million of call it, free cash flow-ish that will be used between M&A and share repurchases. \n But we're currently leveraged at around 2.5x debt-to-trailing 12 months EBITDA, and we're at the low end of 2.5x, and we give a targeted range of 2.5 to 3x. So within that, call it, 0.5 point on a, call it, a $2 billion plus EBITDA basis, we have another $1 billion of capacity. So we'll still have a lot of financial flexibility to do share repurchases, to do tuck-in acquisitions that we feel are strategic, but we feel very good about the deals that we've announced this year. Obviously, we'll spend a lot of time integrating them into the company, but we have the -- obviously, the financial flexibility as well as still a good pipeline of potential opportunities on the deal front going forward. Yes. When you look at the -- also, I guess, our implied guidance, so you're looking at a stronger top line growth than what we did in the first quarter with our guidance, but that's just really driven off of COVID becoming less of an issue. It was a bigger issue in the first quarter decline year-on-year, plus that's where we had the adverse impact from weather. So really when you adjust for that, as Adam's commented, the demand that we're seeing, which is came in a little bit stronger than we expected. We expect that to be similar demand going forward throughout the rest of the year."
