        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Apollo Global Management's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today's discussion, all callers will be placed in a listen-only mode and following management's prepared remarks, the conference call will be open for question. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statement and projections which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in Apollo Fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Mintzberg Head of Investor Relations. \nPeter Mintzberg: Thanks operator and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. As many of you know, I joined the firm in November as Head of Investor Relations. And I'm very glad to be here with you all today for my first earnings call with Apollo. Joining me this morning are Marc Rowan, Josh Harris, and Martin Kelly. Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman are also on the line for questions. I would like to turn it over to Marc to kick off our comments for today.\nMarc Rowan: Thanks Peter. Good morning everyone. I'm excited to be here following the conclusion of my very poorly planned recent sabbatical. I look forward to engaging with our investors and shareholders as I transition into my new role. As you will hear in more detail the Apollo platform is strong, resilient, extremely well-positioned for growth in today's landscape as our exceptional 2020 results have demonstrated. Before I turn to the quarter and the year, I want to review the announcements that were contained in the various communications last week. I will first touch on governance, then leadership, and lastly our investors. In terms of governance, we believe the changes described in Leon's letter last week were an important step in our evolution from a private partnership to the standard set by the best public companies. Our industry is in transition. Our firm is in transition. All of us are moving from the small private partnerships that we started life as to important components of a more global financial system. Proper governance and transparency are going to be essential to play the role that we are supposed to play in this marketplace. Specifically as a firm, we are committed to moving promptly to a governance structure that will enhance our Board with additional diversity, possessing different viewpoints to bring experience to bear that is needed to help drive our business forward. We are committed to moving our Board to two-thirds independent over the near-term and we are committed to appointing a lead independent Director who will actively and regularly engage with the management and the Board. As it relates to Directors, we have already made substantial progress. Last week we announced that Pam Joyner and Sid Mukherjee will be joining our Board effective March 1st. Further, we are in active dialogue to bring additional high-quality talent on board to help us drive the business forward at our Board of Directors level. Beyond the Board changes, as we have alluded to we have begun a process with our independent committee of the Board to promptly evaluate and review the steps necessary for Apollo to adopt a one share one vote structure and other changes that will be required to be eligible for us to be included in a broader set of market indices. These changes I believe would be incredibly beneficial for our firm and again further reflect our commitment to moving to a more modern state given the important role that we play in the financial landscape. I believe the independent committee of the Board will return promptly with their recommendations and we will take it from there. Away from the governance changes, we are making a series of changes to Apollo's leadership. Leon will be retiring as CEO and will remain Chairman of the Board. Josh will remain a co-Founder and member of the Board and Executive Committee working with our largest investors, evolving our integrated platform, and expanding the strategic opportunities where we look for investments. Scott and Jim will be assuming additional responsibilities as we all realign our areas of focus. We are fortunate to have an incredibly deep bench of talented partners who have been together a very long time. Leon, Josh and I have been together and been partners for more than 30 years. We have been through all kinds of market cycles and all kinds of events and I expect our partnership to endure for a very long time. Having reviewed governance and leadership let me now turn to speak about our investors. This has been a busy week plus of communication with our investors. We have had an opportunity to speak with a very broad cross-section of our limited partners and their advisers and consulting relationships regarding the conclusion of the Conflicts Committee review and the governance and leadership changes. The vast majority have indicated that they are satisfied with the announcements, which they and we believe strike the right balance for the firm. Perhaps most importantly, they appreciated the seriousness with which we took the process and the transparency. As we expected, a smaller portion of our investors will need time to consider these events and the changes we are implementing. And in some instances they may actually want to see how these changes unfold. We realize that we may not be able to satisfy each and every of more than our 100 -- excuse me, 1,500 institutional investors, but we have made tremendous progress. We must continuously strive to improve our process and governance and most importantly to deliver superior investment returns to our investors. We expect third-party fundraising to build significantly now that we have addressed these issues. The strength of the business shows that even in this past quarter with these headwinds we continue to raise money across a number of funds and syndicated more than $9 billion of investments amongst our limited partners and insurance affiliates. As I said the business powers ahead. As Josh will discuss, this was a record year for Apollo across multiple metrics. AUM is at a record high, increasing by more than $22 billion in this quarter alone. The momentum in this business is strong and as we implement these various changes, I expect that momentum to increase. Now to take a step back. This is a unique time for me to become CEO of Apollo. We are a growth business and we are fortunate to be a provider of a service that's an incredibly high demand namely investment returns. In addition to the product, we provide our market is growing and it's growing dramatically. We primarily serve retirees either directly through our insurance affiliates in the form of guaranteed income or indirectly with our yield in opportunistic products through institutions like retirement systems, pension plans, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and others. All of these clients we serve are looking for investment returns. And it is our job to continue to grow our front-end, meaning, our ability and capacity to generate good returns per unit of risk assumed. While the AUM growth this year is nothing short of substantial and spectacular, growing AUM is just a measure and not a goal in itself. It is the result of good performance. For good managers like Apollo, the ability to raise money is not the primary governor of our growth. It is our capacity in difficult markets to source investments that provide above-average returns for the risks undertaken. As long as we maintain our capacity and grow our capacity to produce returns, AUM will follow. I feel fortunate to be leading an incredibly healthy business. I believe we have a unique opportunity Apollo -- at Apollo based on the strength of our people coupled with our investment expertise across numerous sectors and the benefit of our permanent capital vehicles. We are strategically positioned at the intersection of growth yield and value. Our particular edge is being able to source assets that cater to a range of capital structures from lower yield insurance company balance sheets to high-return opportunity funds. In a market that is characterized by indexation, correlation and volatility. I believe that presents a unique opportunity for Apollo style of investing to really stand out. An Apollo portfolio is fundamentally different than a BlackRock portfolio a Blackstone portfolio or anyone else's portfolio. The unique skill -- unique DNA of Apollo is to source investments up and down the risk-reward spectrum that represent good returns per unit of risk undertaken. So long as we stick to that tenet, we will continue to be successful and we will continue to grow our firm. I would be remiss not to take a moment to thank Apollo's more than 1,500 employees around the world. They have worked tirelessly in a very difficult year to achieve the impressive results we have announced today. I'm extremely proud of the extraordinary team, their perseverance and dedication they have demonstrated throughout this very interesting year. With that I turn it over to Josh to cover our strong results for the year. \nJosh Harris: Thanks Marc. We're all really glad to have you back from semi-sabbatical and in your up and coming role as CEO. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the unprecedented challenges we have all faced this past year with individuals as an organization and at society. The impact of this global health and economic crisis including illness, numerable losses, record unemployment and extreme market volatility are far-reaching and what we felt for a long, long time. Thank you to all the essential workers who have worked tirelessly to get us through this difficult time and who continue to push our country forward. Despite this challenging backdrop, Apollo delivered very strong results for the year, validating the resilience and differentiation of our business model. We acted quickly to help our investors, many of whom are the frontline workers getting us through this crisis, while at the same time helping many great companies during extenuating circumstances by providing liquidity solutions. We reported record inflows of $123 billion and achieved deployment activity of $88 billion. We generated record fee-related earnings of $2.37 per share reflecting 15% growth year-over-year and have surpassed $1 billion of FRE for the first time in our firm's history. In addition, we've exceeded $450 billion of AUM another milestone for the firm. For the fourth quarter we reported distributable earnings of $0.72 per common share; pretax fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.63 per share; and a cash dividend of $0.60 per share. We ended 2020 at $455 billion of AUM growing 38% year-over-year as a result of a record inflow year which included $13 billion of inflows for the fourth quarter. Organic growth accounted for 16% of the 38% increase in AUM and with two insurance transactions creating the remaining 22% increase. Specifically the $123 billion of inflows for the year was driven by $72 billion of inflows from the two notable insurance transactions which created additional scale for both Athene and Athora; $17 billion of organic growth in our insurance platforms; and $22 billion of third-party capital raising across our new large-scale origination platform ASOP; new vintages of existing fund franchise such as Hybrid Value and Accord; and new product initiatives including the IPO of our Apollo strategic growth capital SPAC; and the launch of our first infrastructure opportunities fund. Turning to deployment, the breadth and differentiation of our platform resulted in $88 billion invested this year on behalf of our clients. This deployment included repositioning and growth in the assets of Athena and Athora's balance sheets following the two transactions during the year, organic growth at the insurance platforms and growth in our private credit origination business. In a year marked by so much change, our role as a capital solutions provider for companies greatly expanded. Our origination capabilities continue to broaden and now span middle market and large-cap corporate lending, as well as numerous asset-based lending categories. We see a large opportunity for Apollo to continue leveraging its intellectual capital across credit, private equity and real assets to meet the needs of our clients and provide solutions to a diverse set of companies. In the fourth quarter we provided $9.3 billion of bespoke off-the-run long-dated capital solutions for investment-grade companies. Among these included a $4 billion dip financing for Hertz which provided a structured solution for its fleet; a $3.1 billion transaction for Anheuser-Busch, InBev's container manufacturing business. Each of these deals was customized to the needs of the respective company and demonstrate our ability to create a wide spectrum of bespoke financing solutions to corporations. Turning to FRE. The momentum we generated through our robust AUM growth and capital deployment translated into growth in our fee-related earnings to reach $2.37 for the year and grew 15% year-over-year. Management fees grew to $1.65 billion, up 11% year-over-year and demonstrated very little correlation with volatile public markets. We made several important investments across the platform in 2020, focused on expanding our origination capabilities, furthering new growth initiatives such as our infrastructure impact and SPAC strategies, scaling our technology and infrastructure groups across the firm. In addition to the strong financial results we achieved in 2020, Apollo and its portfolio companies focused significant attention on providing support to one another and our broader communities. We continue to prioritize and realize the full value of environmental social and governance factors, and believe strongly that seizing ESG opportunities makes us better investors and better stewards by positioning Apollo and our funds portfolio companies for sustainable success. Just as important, we believe that Apollo can and should have a positive impact on society beyond its businesses, helping to make the world a better place and improving people's lives. In line with that mission, we were proud to launch a citizenship grant program, matching employees' charitable contributions and rewarding employees' volunteer time. This year, we donated more than $50 million to philanthropic causes and contributed 3,550 hours of service. Through the matching program, employees have donated to more than 1,500 different non-profit organizations to-date. To echo Marc's comments, our firm's resiliency and strong business model, strategically position us for success in today's evolving market landscape. Our financial position is strong, anchored by the $273 billion of AUM in permanent capital vehicles, 60% of our total AUM. Our fee-related earnings continue to grow through varying market environments with close to 100% of our pre-tax earnings in 2020, derived from FRE, giving our shareholders high visibility into our core earnings drivers. Looking ahead, we anticipate increased demand for Apollo's investment expertise. Investors continue to struggle with sourcing yield, driving demand for a proprietary and scaled origination. Investors increasingly seek global scaled asset managers with the ability to create solutions for a wide variety of mandates across lower cost capital, such as insurance to higher return opportunistic capital. We believe the path forward is bright for Apollo and we're incredibly excited to continue on this strong trajectory. I speak for the entire management team in expressing our deep gratitude to our bench of talent, who've come together to drive the success we've experienced this year. Thank you. We are very much looking forward to what 2021 will bring for our firm. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Josh. Let me touch on FRE DE and dividend to start with. For the fourth quarter, management fees grew 3% over the prior quarter and 13% over the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by growth in fees for investing the assets of our insurance clients as well as deployment-driven growth in our credit and real assets businesses. For the full year 2020, management fees grew 11% over the prior year. Transaction and advisory fees were $81 million in the quarter, driven by capital solutions transactions and private equity activity. Compensation grew 8% over the prior quarter. This reflects our continued investment in growth initiatives across the firm, including support for our insurance businesses. Head count grew by more than 20% in each of the last two years, driven by the growth areas that Josh has highlighted. Non-compensation costs grew 12% over the prior quarter and included costs related to the independent review. For the fourth quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.60 per share and after-tax distributable earnings of $0.72 per share, our highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. Our strong FRE of $0.63 per share were supported by net incentive earnings of $0.15 per share. Turning to incentive realizations. We realized $187 million of gross performance fees for the fourth quarter, primarily related to our credit strategies fund, which returned 24% in 2020. Gains from sales in Fund VIII will return to LPs as a result of the impairments recognized in the first half of 2020. At the end of the fourth quarter, the netting hole on Fund VIII had been reduced to $266 million equivalent to $0.06 per share of delayed net carry, down from $1.1 billion as of the second quarter. This fourth quarter reduction was driven principally by a secondary transaction for Voya during the quarter. As a reminder Fund VIII remains in full carry with the current gross and net IRR of 16% and 11% respectively. The clawback obligations of $0.31 per share that we report in our earnings release are related to older legacy funds including Fund VII and Natural Resources I are specific to those funds and are not cross-collateralized across other funds. As we have noted in the past, we do not expect any of these clawback amounts to become cash obligations for at least several years from now. Deployment in our funds was $2.5 billion -- in our drawdown funds was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $17 billion for the full year, in line with annual averages. Our broader measure of deployment which reflects the breadth of our origination business was again strong at $24 billion for the fourth quarter and $88 billion for the year. Fourth quarter deployment was supported by the large origination activities Josh highlighted, as well as a pickup in middle market and commercial real estate lending. Our dry powder for investments across our fund complex was $47 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $21 billion has the potential to drive management fees when invested. On performance. Moving on to investment performance during the fourth quarter, our private equity funds portfolio appreciated by 13%, driven by strong performance across our funds public and private holdings. Fund VIII and Fund IX appreciated by 10% and 17% respectively, driving an increase in the net carry asset to $1.82 per share. Fund VIII is now marked at a multiple of invested capital of 1.6 times and we expect it to continue to create value as the portfolio matures. Fund IX crossed into carry for the first time in the fourth quarter. For the full year our private equity funds portfolio appreciated 6.9%, which compares favorably to the performance of the S&P Value index down 1.4%. In credit, our fund's aggregate portfolio returned 4.4% during the quarter. Through a very volatile year in the credit markets, we were able to protect our portfolios on the downside and outperformed broader indices. Notably for 2020 our global corporate credit business generated a 6.7% total return, reflecting over 300 basis points of outperformance to its benchmark. In addition, the performance of broadly syndicated loans in our credit portfolio exceeded the S&P LOI by approximately 140 basis points for the year. High-yield bond performance exceeded the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield index by nearly 800 basis points for the same period. Our strong credit performance has been driven in part by the excess spread we have been able to generate for our insurance clients, which stands from our differentiated and expanding origination capabilities. In real assets our overall return for the quarter was up 3.1%, driven by broad appreciation across the portfolio. Energy continued to have a de minimis impact on our performance in both private equity and credit this quarter. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.6 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. Our net economic balance sheet after debt and preferred stock was approximately $4.80 per share at December 31, ahead of the $4.25 at the end of 2019 and prior to the pandemic-induced sell-off. To echo Josh, we're very pleased with our 2020 earnings, driven by robust growth and resilient fee revenues. We're appreciative of the support that we have received from employees, shareholders, investors and partners throughout the year and look forward to engaging with you all further in 2020 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Mintzberg: Thank you, Martin. That concludes our remarks for today. Operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. Maybe one for Marc, just up at the top big picture, I think it's good to see, that back to the growth and growth on the front foot. But with credit insurance let's call it, 75% of assets, private equity already huge and great. I'm just curious as you think about building for the next decade, where real estate, infrastructure, retail capital markets like the other areas to grow and broaden Apollo to help our investors with your mission. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on that.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. You touched on some of it, but I'll start with, how I think. The limit on our growth, which you're referring to, is not the ability to raise money. It's the ability to deploy it sensibly, in an Apollo-esque manner. In the private equity business, we are large. We will continue to grow, but you're right, that will not be a source of massive growth. The credit business is large, in a sense that we talk about. But in the context of the markets that we participate in, we're just beginning. We have an amazing opportunity in credit, particularly with respect to origination. In the real estate market which you also touched on, we have an immense real estate footprint. We simply don't group it in our financials or in our assets, because much of what we do in the real estate business is in yield, rather than an opportunity. We are building the real estate business. The real estate business is raising funds in the US opportunity market, in the Asian opportunity market, in the net lease market, in the debt market and in the core plus market. On every one of our insurance company balance sheets real estate is an expanding category. And I would expect our real estate business to increase. We have a lot of white space, but it has to be done in an Apollo-esque way. Infrastructure, Infrastructure 1, double-digit rates of return in the infrastructure market, back out in the market with infrastructure 2, again, an area that I expect to expand in a big way impact, exactly the same thing. Every one of these funds, the thing that ties them together, is not the desire to simply go out and raise AUM, but the identification of an opportunity that we believe, reflects Apollo. The Apollo investment brand fundamentally, means that we believe we are taking less risk, per unit of return, at every point in the capital structure from investment-grade down to the most opportunistic. To -- maybe I'll drone on for one more second. I think one of the biggest opportunities we have is to massively expand our front-end, which is our capacity to generate returns. This is bringing on board teams. This is buying in platforms. This is also building organically, from initiatives already underway within Apollo. I'll stop there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning everyone. And I hope, you all are doing well and staying healthy. My question is, what is the potential time line for the full C-corp conversion?\nMarc Rowan: So, we'll break Craig into, -- I'll give you an initial response, and then, I'll turn it over to Martin. So as I mentioned, we have asked our independent committee to promptly study and give us recommendations with respect to moving to one share one vote, and the other changes necessary to be eligible for broad index inclusion which would include a full C-corp conversion. I would expect we will hear back from them, no later than our next conference call. With that -- as to the specific steps, I'll turn it over to Martin.\nMartin Kelly: Yeah, Craig, there's different ways that you can achieve, inclusion in indices. And so we're very familiar with what they are. And so, we're just -- they have different impacts and different time lines associated with them frankly. So we're working through all the details around that. And the approvals that will be needed from different constituents in view of what different outcomes might be. So we're -- we know what's ahead of us. We're working through all the considerations. And then we'll update you in due course.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein --. Your line is-- from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Great, thank you. Good morning everybody. Marc I was hoping to dig in a little bit more into the LP feedback, since the completion of the investigation. You mentioned that you expect fundraising dynamics to build significantly from here, so maybe spend a minute on sort of the path and the time line for this acceleration. Which strategies do you expect to be most active contributors to the fundraising outlook for Apollo over the next 12 months? And then when you take a step back, are there common characteristics between LPs that are sort of satisfied with the process and the results of the investigation versus those that sort of need more time as you said in your earlier remarks? Thanks.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. So I'll hit it up front. As to the specific strategies, I'll turn to Scott and Jim to talk about the strategies that are active in the market and where we think we're going to make the most progress in 2021. We've done a lot of limited partner and consultant calls. That's just \u2013 not just me. That's the entirety of our team. The vast majority of feedback from the LPs and consultants to date has been positive. They appreciate the seriousness and transparency and thought that we have put into this process. ESG are not just three initials to them or to us. This is something that we have to live every day. They have acknowledged that the report by Dechert substantiated what we told them, no involvement by Apollo or its employees and no wrongdoing on Leon's part. And they've commended us on the actions we've taken with respect to the governance changes and the succession planning. For the vast majority of LPs that will be enough. They think we've struck the right balance. For some LPs as I've said, they will want to see how these changes develop. And for some they will want to see these changes fully implemented. I do not believe that there is a specific characteristic across limited partners who perhaps are fully satisfied versus those who are less than fully satisfied at this point in time. But I will note with $455 billion of AUM and 1,500 institutional investors, something is happening in our funding business almost every day. In the fourth quarter, a number of people hit pause simply to wait to see the outcome. I believe in the first quarter we will see some of that pause simply come through and then we will get stronger every day. As to the specific products, why don't I start with Scott and then Scott will hand it to Jim.\nScott Kleinman: Sure. So look on the opportunistic side, as Marc touched on a little bit earlier, we're in the market now with infrastructure with Asian real estate with impact. We are \u2013 we have raised and continue to raise additional SPACs. We'd expect to see more of that. We have some new products that we're working on that in all likelihood will be coming out in a meaningful way this year as well. On the credit side, a number of evergreen funds that are \u2013 have been fundraising and continue to fundraise large-cap originations that often syndicate to our LPs as well. So quite a bit of activity expected for 2021. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is open.\nRobert Lee: Thanks for taking my question. And Marc, quite a move from sabbatical to CEO. So hope congratulations are in order for you. I'm just curious, there's a lot of \u2013 going on in terms of investment in the business. Can you maybe update us on how you're thinking about how these initiatives we should be thinking about how they will impact kind of FRE margins going forward? You're already pretty high investment \u2013 best-in-class. So where do you think to go from here is I guess my first question.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. Why don't I take that? So clearly in hindsight taking a sabbatical in the middle of pandemic is a very bad idea. First, I went nowhere and I did nothing. But in some sense it actually accomplished everything it was supposed to accomplish. The first half of 2020, I worked like an associate, new to a firm. We closed two of the largest insurance transactions in the insurance marketplace. And by the end of June, I needed a little bit of a break. And when I say it accomplished what it was supposed to accomplish with me sitting there every day the team that is way smarter than I am, that really makes things happen in the insurance business, never got to spread their wings. We now \u2013 with six months to have passed, we've settled into a routine that is completely sustainable, where I am involved in those things that add value where I can add value but where the day-to-day responsibility is in the hands of people, who as you will meet them in our various investor presentations, you will come to the same conclusion that I have which it gets better once you get past me. As it relates to FRE margins, I'll put it in the context of more of our five-year plan. 15 months ago, we sponsored an Investor Day. And I believe, when we rolled out the target, and we said $600 billion of AUM, I was watching the audience a number of faces dropped and thought that goal was unsustainable or unrealistic. 15 months later, we're halfway toward that target. The outcome of that target, since AUM is the fundamental driver of revenue is mid-double-digit growth for a very long period of time. As to growth and investment, in any particular year, it is not the revenue or the AUM that I so much focus on, or that you should be focused on. The decision in any given year as to whether we will grow double digit low or double-digit high will be primarily driven by the pace of investments in the front end, and we balance that very carefully. As you've heard me say already, I believe, we are in a growth business. We serve people, who are desperate for yield. Our institutional business is growing. Our insurance business is growing. Our retail business is growing. We need to make sure, we grow the front end, consistent with the AUM potential we have, rather than focus on growing AUM. Hopefully that answers your question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Maybe more broadly in private equity, Apollo tends to be a value investor, and US market valuations are elevated based on a historic perspective. I know your announced pipeline looks quite good, but valuations are now quite elevated. And should we expect the pace of investment to start to slow here? And then, maybe on a tangent, does the SPAC market grow big enough to maybe further drive competition here, making it even harder to invest new investor dollars? Thanks.\nScott Kleinman: Sure. So, look, as I've said in the past, market indexes aren't necessarily a good indicator of what's going on across the breadth of the market. The pipeline in the PD business is really stronger now than it's been at any time even through the crisis. And so, I would expect, if I had to estimate a bigger-than-average deployment year in private equity this year, just based on what we're seeing and what we have teed up even in the short to medium term. So, I actually think deployment across private equity, hybrid value, a number of our other opportunistic funds, notwithstanding the market backdrop is still incredibly strong. As far as your question around SPACs, look, we ultimately see SPACs, as an interesting asset class. It is not a flash in the pan. SPACs are here to stay for a lot of fundamental reasons. In some respects, is it competition? Sure, but we've always had competition. If anything, Apollo has now proven our ability to successfully issue SPACs. We've issued a number. We have several more in the pipeline and see it as a real opportunity to add to the asset category footprint that we have. And I think, you'll continue to see that be an increasing part of how we approach the market across the spectrum of risk and return.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you, very much, and Marc, congratulations as well. Maybe a question for Martin just to tie it together some big picture with maybe the operational side of things, could you dimension in the fourth quarter, how much of the G&A or other expenses were related to the inquiry? And then as you think about 2021, could you dimension a little bit about where you sort of see either comp ratio or the non-comp FRE drivers just given Marc's commentary about growing the front end?\nMartin Kelly: Sure. So, I think Bill, the step-up in Q4 from Q3 on non-comp was effectively explained or was explained by the cost of the review. And so as we look forward, it's a slightly different answer for comp and non-comp. We are growing. We've added headcount and so it's natural to expect the cost of the firm continue to increase. On the non-comp side, we're looking at and we're engaged in new premises in many offices around the world including both New York and London. That comes with a cost. And so we manage non-comp very carefully and tightly. But as the headcount growth, the firm increases and the needs to support all our employee base increased then so do the cost. Comp comes back to -- I put that in the context of Marc's comments and that is we focus on FRE growth and we manage FRE growth relative to investments in the platform and building out the origination side and all the support that's needed for that with the revenue growth that comes with that. It's not a straight line, but we are very -- we have strong conviction in our mid-teens FRE growth rate as we look forward from here. And I would just echo Marc's comments that there's a range around that. It could be low double digit. It could be mid to high teens in any one year, but we manage that based on the opportunities to grow the platform in view of when we think the revenue will come.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess, the fundraising -- the 2021 fundraising from a different angle. I think you said around $49 million, $50 billion of the gross inflow last year was what you consider organic. So as you think about all the stuff you listed that's in the market or expected to be in the market this year, what do you think is a good range for gross fundraising relative to that number excluding your view of what Athene and the Athora deal volume could be?\nMarc Rowan: So I'm going to start and then I'm going to turn it I guess to Martin. I think it's important to understand, how we come at this holistically. So there is Athene and Athora deal volume. But as you know we are in the re-tech market every day. This year organic growth at just Athene, north of $20 billion. We are among the largest providers of alternative asset services in the retail marketplace. We elect to do that though in the form of guaranteed income rather than in the form of funds. We can at a later date explore the efficiency of that. When we start a new fundraise, no matter, which fund it is, we start with a very important anchor relative to almost anyone else in our marketplace. And that anchor is our massive permanent capital vehicles. They are as you know mostly allocated to yield alternatives, which is high grade. In fact yield alternatives, which is how their business runs but roughly 5% of their portfolio is allocated to alternatives. Making sure that we deliver adequate alternative assets to our insurance platforms is a very important part of achieving the overall returns of the insurance company and it actually has a second benefit. It aligns us to a much greater degree with our investors in that we own in some instances 15% or 20% of a new alternatives fund relative to what a GP commitment might be. So with that intro, I will then turn over to Martin. \nMartin Kelly: Great. So just I'll just put some -- a bit more color around that. We typically raise -- away from a year when we're reaching a big flagship fund in PE, we typically raise somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion of third-party capital. And then in addition to that, we have organic growth at the insurance platforms plus we have insurance M&A. And then we have further deployment of assets in our insurance platforms as we reposition their balance sheets. So without any, sort of, unusually large M&A, without any flagship you're in the range of $40 billion to $50 billion a year give or take, and then with upside from there driven by the other two components. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you guys could maybe provide a little bit of an update on some of the direct origination platforms that you've been building out ranging from mid-cap aircraft leasing some of the newer ones. How are those progressing? And maybe you could just talk about your plans for building those out further from here whether it's in terms of head count adds other appetite for other asset classes and such? Thanks.\nMarc Rowan: Perfect. Jim, why don't you take that? \nJim Zelter: Great, thanks, Mike. Certainly, I would say, let's talk about the assessment of what we have in place versus growth. So as you highlighted mid-cap and PK both platforms that we entered 2020 strong objectives, and notwithstanding the challenges of March and April, strong years in both strong ROE at mid-cap and growth in the platform across all its activities. Same case with PK and merch where we put capital to work throughout the year and strong performance and a balance sheet that comes out in pristine shape. Both of those entities have a variety of great liquidity and additional equity that is \u2013 will be attaching or attracting over the several months. So, great growth out of those two. Marc also highlighted activities in the net lease space in the core plus and core space over in Europe and the U.S. two big growth areas for us. And I suspect, this year you'll see not only additional capital raise but deployment really first and foremost from our insurance balance sheets as Marc described, but also across the board from institutions as well which we're seeing a great demand from companies to think about how they think about their real estate considering what's going on in 2020. So a very, very strong pipeline there. I would say also, you know, we talked a lot about AOP our large-cap origination platform very healthy start to the first quarter of 2021. And finally, a lot of activities that you saw as a result last year, whether it was the ADNOC transaction, whether it was the Hertz securitization and dip whether it was the ABI transaction in the fourth quarter. So this whole large-cap and high-grade alpha which we are having a very, very strong end on so we see that \u2013 those are really the drivers and as Marc and Martin pointed out, we find ourselves in the enviable position that intellectual capital coming from the institutional sell-side from the big banks we are a partner of twice as they decide. And last year, across the firm, we brought in over 300 people. Many, many of those were high-quality individuals that we added to our origination platform. So, we feel like the opportunity has never been as strong as we sit here in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeremy Campbell: Hi. Thanks. Martin, just getting a couple of questions from investors this morning here on the performance fee side of the equation. I know, you had a little color about Fund VIII a couple of hundred million still left there. But just wondering, if you \u2013 and I know, it's a little market-dependent, but wondering if you have any line of sight around when Apollo might be able to work through those issues and we can start seeing funds \u2013 fees show back up in the P&L in a more robust fashion for private equity?\nMartin Kelly: Yeah, Jeremy, we're virtually through the delay in realizations resulting from the impairment. In my comments, I referred to a $0.06 delay. So the next $0.06 of what would otherwise be no carry coming out is to the LPs. And then after that, we're in the clear. And so any monetizations from them will create carry. I think the further benefit is as Fund IX continues to invest, and as Scott mentioned, with a healthy pipeline in front of us, and now being in carry we have a good line of sight into multiple years of Fund VIII realizations, with Fund IX tacking on to the back end of that. So the clawback is not an issue. It's specific to old funds. It's not specific to Fund VIII at all and so that's not an issue in terms of realizations. So I think as we look forward, there's a ramp in front of us to get through into what we see as a more normalized monetization period and carry coming through the PE business. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just seeing your comments on focusing on growth for the firm. Obviously, you guys have done a good job from an organic standpoint. So maybe away from insurance, just wanted to get your update on appetite for pursuing M&A to expand either in different strategies or geographies as we've seen some of your peers do? \nMarc Rowan: Okay. Again, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Jim and Scott. And first, thank you for your comments and I look forward to -- at our next Investor Day exploring what I'm about to say in more detail. But to be provocative, I believe we're going to see more change in our industry over the next five years than we have in the past 10.  If you step away and just think about what's happened, we've had a decade-plus of financial repression where investors who were relying on a certain set rate of guaranteed return or fixed income return have been unable to achieve that and they've been pushed further and further out on the risk spectrum to try and achieve any kind of normal return. To date that return has been met because we've been in a very interesting market.  At the same time, what we've seen is, we've seen two other -- perhaps three other really big trends. Trend one is indexation. The more and more market gets indexed the more things fall out of an index and create interesting opportunity. Second is correlation. And the third is volatility as we're seeing in spades in this market. All three, I believe present interesting opportunities for us to invest around, for us to augment our franchise in ways perhaps unexpected. And with that I'll see if Scott wants to add anything. \nScott Kleinman: Yes. Look, I think as we continue to grow into geographies, into products, into sectors, we're always looking at can we build it ourselves, can we bolt on small teams or do we have to take larger steps and make more sizable acquisitions. And so all of that's completely on the table. And as we just pursue these different options, I think you'll see more of a mix of all of that going forward. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. Good morning. I just want to talk a little bit more about the deployment backdrop and then maybe coming at it from some of the comments you just made, Marc. I mean, the perspective here is that the credit backdrop has recovered dramatically. Risk assets are at highs or close to it. And I know Apollo is always thinking about the upside opportunities, but also the downside risks. And so in a backdrop where it doesn't feel like there's being a lot of risk priced in broadly, how is that informing kind of the views on deployment? And I guess, what are some of the things you're looking at that are maybe different around deploying capital into this environment? \nMarc Rowan : Sure. Why don't I hand that to Jim to start? \nJim Zelter : Sure. I mean, I really think the answer to that is looking back in our performance in 2020. If we had sat here a year ago and we described for you the litany of transactions from ADNOC to Expedia to Albertsons to ABI to both Hertz transactions, you would have said those were going to come out of the auspices of the banks. That was their regime. That's their opportunity. And so we have found ourselves in the enviable position of having expertise on sourcing, structuring, taking down and potentially syndicating those transactions. So the theme that we've talked about for several years, the evolution of intellectual capital from The Street to the buy side, the search for yield, the regulatory environment, our footprint, all the themes that Marc and Josh have been highlighting here, we just see those accelerating. And when we think about our pipeline for those transactions, which we think there's really just a handful of firms in the world that can do the execution, I just mentioned that's what excites us about our ability to grow. And also it's just -- it's the feedback loop to focusing more and more on that front end as Marc described. So I think the evolution of the business is constantly changing. Regardless of what happens in the regulatory front, we think that our robust model from sourcing and execution is really unmatched. And we expect that to continue not only in the US, but around the globe in Europe and in Asia. And in our view that's a real highlight of our growth opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Harris: Great. Thanks guys. So there's been a lot of focus obviously on existing LPs and their willingness to reallocate to Apollo. Now that the review is over, can you talk a bit about the prospects for an expansion of Apollo's LP base?\nJim Zelter: Sure. This is Jim. I think I can't emphasize enough. As Marc said, we are a massive platform of $425 billion. We have thousands of institutional investors and certainly we see what's going on in the evolution of savings with regard to the wirehouses, RIAs and several others. And I think you should expect to see us expand that types of fundraising channels in the appropriate yield channels over the coming year and years ahead. We have brought on some folks to do that. We have augmented the team and part of our budget in 2021 and 2022 will be to really accelerate that. I do think that when we think about our platform and the conversation that's going on about distribution channels, we think we're particularly well suited to do so. Again, if you look at the -- I know there's a question earlier about our pipeline of products. We currently have about 11 products in the market, four/five of those are really evergreen. The other six/seven are the episodic ones that Scott mentioned. And certainly, there's a scalability to a variety of things whether it's our Accord Series, whether it's our TRF Series, whatever we have going on in core and core plus. So we feel that we have a great portfolio to apply to that diversification. And again, I think we have a great list of institutional LPs, but certainly there's ways for us to expand that on a continued basis as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks. Perhaps one the insurance outlook. I mean, clearly more entrants, more competition. So just kind of curious as to kind of any context or commentary you might be able to add as it relates to just more competition in that market. And also on a related basis, how we should think about the repositioning of last year's acquisitions. For example, did the market environment allow for an acceleration of that? Are you maybe more than 50% through it, or just some kind of context as it relates to those portfolios? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. It's Marc. I'll start with your second question and work backwards, which is to say ,I'm not going to steal Athene's thunder. They will be announcing results on the 17th. But in the commentary they've made to date, I know they are very pleased with how things are going. And some of the transactions that both Jim and Josh alluded to were anchored by our insurance company balance sheets both in the US and in Europe. Competition in any market is inevitable. People have seen now what we have built over the last 11 or 12 years and I assure you that we have paid substantial tuition. Buying something is not the same as integrating your business with an insurance company. Every morning at Apollo there are 150 people who wake up and do nothing other than insurance. The plumbing, the piping, the understanding of how assets get onboarded onto an insurance company balance sheet is different than making investments in insurance. It's different than managing money for insurance companies. It's a fundamentally different skill set. To delve in perhaps more than you wanted to what we have succeeded in doing in the insurance business is to create a virtuous circle. Insurance is a capital-intensive business. Every time you grow in insurance, you have to raise capital to support that growth from a regulatory point of view. What we have done is we have gotten to be so large and so profitable that we generate significant amounts of internal capital, so that we are able to continue to grow without necessarily raising new capital. If we want to grow really fast, yes, we augment the balance sheet by again integrating limited partners or integrating specific funds into our insurance company acquisitions. But it all starts with having a profitable insurance business. If you look at our public entity Athene, Athene has grown north of 15%, since inception, in terms of earnings. Any growth, any asset management has to be good for the underlying client, whether that client is a limited partner, whether that client is a retail investor or whether that client is an insurance company. This is all about balance and I'll come back to where Jim ended and where I started. We are not limited in our growth by the amount of money that can be raised. With our -- that's not true for every fund and every product. But across our platform, if we want to raise more money, we can be more aggressive in the reinsurance market. We can be more aggressive in the retail market. We can be more aggressive in the FABN market and so on and so on and so on. What we need to do is we need to have growth of the front end consistent with growth in the back end, because for an insurance company, particularly in the businesses that we're in, it's about earning adequate spread on a risk-adjusted basis. For our institutional and retail clients, it's about earning adequate return for the risk they undertake. The limiter of our growth is not our ability to raise AUM from any source. It is the ability to scale the front end of our business which should be our primary focus. And if we're good at that, AUM will take care of itself. Hopefully that answers your question.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Peter Mintzberg for closing remarks.\nPeter Mintzberg: Thanks again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Josh Harris",
            "content": "Thanks Marc. We're all really glad to have you back from semi-sabbatical and in your up and coming role as CEO. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the unprecedented challenges we have all faced this past year with individuals as an organization and at society. The impact of this global health and economic crisis including illness, numerable losses, record unemployment and extreme market volatility are far-reaching and what we felt for a long, long time. Thank you to all the essential workers who have worked tirelessly to get us through this difficult time and who continue to push our country forward. Despite this challenging backdrop, Apollo delivered very strong results for the year, validating the resilience and differentiation of our business model. We acted quickly to help our investors, many of whom are the frontline workers getting us through this crisis, while at the same time helping many great companies during extenuating circumstances by providing liquidity solutions. We reported record inflows of $123 billion and achieved deployment activity of $88 billion. We generated record fee-related earnings of $2.37 per share reflecting 15% growth year-over-year and have surpassed $1 billion of FRE for the first time in our firm's history. In addition, we've exceeded $450 billion of AUM another milestone for the firm. For the fourth quarter we reported distributable earnings of $0.72 per common share; pretax fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.63 per share; and a cash dividend of $0.60 per share. We ended 2020 at $455 billion of AUM growing 38% year-over-year as a result of a record inflow year which included $13 billion of inflows for the fourth quarter. Organic growth accounted for 16% of the 38% increase in AUM and with two insurance transactions creating the remaining 22% increase. Specifically the $123 billion of inflows for the year was driven by $72 billion of inflows from the two notable insurance transactions which created additional scale for both Athene and Athora; $17 billion of organic growth in our insurance platforms; and $22 billion of third-party capital raising across our new large-scale origination platform ASOP; new vintages of existing fund franchise such as Hybrid Value and Accord; and new product initiatives including the IPO of our Apollo strategic growth capital SPAC; and the launch of our first infrastructure opportunities fund. Turning to deployment, the breadth and differentiation of our platform resulted in $88 billion invested this year on behalf of our clients. This deployment included repositioning and growth in the assets of Athena and Athora's balance sheets following the two transactions during the year, organic growth at the insurance platforms and growth in our private credit origination business. In a year marked by so much change, our role as a capital solutions provider for companies greatly expanded. Our origination capabilities continue to broaden and now span middle market and large-cap corporate lending, as well as numerous asset-based lending categories. We see a large opportunity for Apollo to continue leveraging its intellectual capital across credit, private equity and real assets to meet the needs of our clients and provide solutions to a diverse set of companies. In the fourth quarter we provided $9.3 billion of bespoke off-the-run long-dated capital solutions for investment-grade companies. Among these included a $4 billion dip financing for Hertz which provided a structured solution for its fleet; a $3.1 billion transaction for Anheuser-Busch, InBev's container manufacturing business. Each of these deals was customized to the needs of the respective company and demonstrate our ability to create a wide spectrum of bespoke financing solutions to corporations. Turning to FRE. The momentum we generated through our robust AUM growth and capital deployment translated into growth in our fee-related earnings to reach $2.37 for the year and grew 15% year-over-year. Management fees grew to $1.65 billion, up 11% year-over-year and demonstrated very little correlation with volatile public markets. We made several important investments across the platform in 2020, focused on expanding our origination capabilities, furthering new growth initiatives such as our infrastructure impact and SPAC strategies, scaling our technology and infrastructure groups across the firm. In addition to the strong financial results we achieved in 2020, Apollo and its portfolio companies focused significant attention on providing support to one another and our broader communities. We continue to prioritize and realize the full value of environmental social and governance factors, and believe strongly that seizing ESG opportunities makes us better investors and better stewards by positioning Apollo and our funds portfolio companies for sustainable success. Just as important, we believe that Apollo can and should have a positive impact on society beyond its businesses, helping to make the world a better place and improving people's lives. In line with that mission, we were proud to launch a citizenship grant program, matching employees' charitable contributions and rewarding employees' volunteer time. This year, we donated more than $50 million to philanthropic causes and contributed 3,550 hours of service. Through the matching program, employees have donated to more than 1,500 different non-profit organizations to-date. To echo Marc's comments, our firm's resiliency and strong business model, strategically position us for success in today's evolving market landscape. Our financial position is strong, anchored by the $273 billion of AUM in permanent capital vehicles, 60% of our total AUM. Our fee-related earnings continue to grow through varying market environments with close to 100% of our pre-tax earnings in 2020, derived from FRE, giving our shareholders high visibility into our core earnings drivers. Looking ahead, we anticipate increased demand for Apollo's investment expertise. Investors continue to struggle with sourcing yield, driving demand for a proprietary and scaled origination. Investors increasingly seek global scaled asset managers with the ability to create solutions for a wide variety of mandates across lower cost capital, such as insurance to higher return opportunistic capital. We believe the path forward is bright for Apollo and we're incredibly excited to continue on this strong trajectory. I speak for the entire management team in expressing our deep gratitude to our bench of talent, who've come together to drive the success we've experienced this year. Thank you. We are very much looking forward to what 2021 will bring for our firm. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Josh. Let me touch on FRE DE and dividend to start with. For the fourth quarter, management fees grew 3% over the prior quarter and 13% over the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by growth in fees for investing the assets of our insurance clients as well as deployment-driven growth in our credit and real assets businesses. For the full year 2020, management fees grew 11% over the prior year. Transaction and advisory fees were $81 million in the quarter, driven by capital solutions transactions and private equity activity. Compensation grew 8% over the prior quarter. This reflects our continued investment in growth initiatives across the firm, including support for our insurance businesses. Head count grew by more than 20% in each of the last two years, driven by the growth areas that Josh has highlighted. Non-compensation costs grew 12% over the prior quarter and included costs related to the independent review. For the fourth quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.60 per share and after-tax distributable earnings of $0.72 per share, our highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. Our strong FRE of $0.63 per share were supported by net incentive earnings of $0.15 per share. Turning to incentive realizations. We realized $187 million of gross performance fees for the fourth quarter, primarily related to our credit strategies fund, which returned 24% in 2020. Gains from sales in Fund VIII will return to LPs as a result of the impairments recognized in the first half of 2020. At the end of the fourth quarter, the netting hole on Fund VIII had been reduced to $266 million equivalent to $0.06 per share of delayed net carry, down from $1.1 billion as of the second quarter. This fourth quarter reduction was driven principally by a secondary transaction for Voya during the quarter. As a reminder Fund VIII remains in full carry with the current gross and net IRR of 16% and 11% respectively. The clawback obligations of $0.31 per share that we report in our earnings release are related to older legacy funds including Fund VII and Natural Resources I are specific to those funds and are not cross-collateralized across other funds. As we have noted in the past, we do not expect any of these clawback amounts to become cash obligations for at least several years from now. Deployment in our funds was $2.5 billion -- in our drawdown funds was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $17 billion for the full year, in line with annual averages. Our broader measure of deployment which reflects the breadth of our origination business was again strong at $24 billion for the fourth quarter and $88 billion for the year. Fourth quarter deployment was supported by the large origination activities Josh highlighted, as well as a pickup in middle market and commercial real estate lending. Our dry powder for investments across our fund complex was $47 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $21 billion has the potential to drive management fees when invested. On performance. Moving on to investment performance during the fourth quarter, our private equity funds portfolio appreciated by 13%, driven by strong performance across our funds public and private holdings. Fund VIII and Fund IX appreciated by 10% and 17% respectively, driving an increase in the net carry asset to $1.82 per share. Fund VIII is now marked at a multiple of invested capital of 1.6 times and we expect it to continue to create value as the portfolio matures. Fund IX crossed into carry for the first time in the fourth quarter. For the full year our private equity funds portfolio appreciated 6.9%, which compares favorably to the performance of the S&P Value index down 1.4%. In credit, our fund's aggregate portfolio returned 4.4% during the quarter. Through a very volatile year in the credit markets, we were able to protect our portfolios on the downside and outperformed broader indices. Notably for 2020 our global corporate credit business generated a 6.7% total return, reflecting over 300 basis points of outperformance to its benchmark. In addition, the performance of broadly syndicated loans in our credit portfolio exceeded the S&P LOI by approximately 140 basis points for the year. High-yield bond performance exceeded the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield index by nearly 800 basis points for the same period. Our strong credit performance has been driven in part by the excess spread we have been able to generate for our insurance clients, which stands from our differentiated and expanding origination capabilities. In real assets our overall return for the quarter was up 3.1%, driven by broad appreciation across the portfolio. Energy continued to have a de minimis impact on our performance in both private equity and credit this quarter. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.6 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. Our net economic balance sheet after debt and preferred stock was approximately $4.80 per share at December 31, ahead of the $4.25 at the end of 2019 and prior to the pandemic-induced sell-off. To echo Josh, we're very pleased with our 2020 earnings, driven by robust growth and resilient fee revenues. We're appreciative of the support that we have received from employees, shareholders, investors and partners throughout the year and look forward to engaging with you all further in 2020 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back to Peter. Yeah, Craig, there's different ways that you can achieve, inclusion in indices. And so we're very familiar with what they are. And so, we're just -- they have different impacts and different time lines associated with them frankly. So we're working through all the details around that. And the approvals that will be needed from different constituents in view of what different outcomes might be. So we're -- we know what's ahead of us. We're working through all the considerations. And then we'll update you in due course. Sure. So, I think Bill, the step-up in Q4 from Q3 on non-comp was effectively explained or was explained by the cost of the review. And so as we look forward, it's a slightly different answer for comp and non-comp. We are growing. We've added headcount and so it's natural to expect the cost of the firm continue to increase. On the non-comp side, we're looking at and we're engaged in new premises in many offices around the world including both New York and London. That comes with a cost. And so we manage non-comp very carefully and tightly. But as the headcount growth, the firm increases and the needs to support all our employee base increased then so do the cost. Comp comes back to -- I put that in the context of Marc's comments and that is we focus on FRE growth and we manage FRE growth relative to investments in the platform and building out the origination side and all the support that's needed for that with the revenue growth that comes with that. It's not a straight line, but we are very -- we have strong conviction in our mid-teens FRE growth rate as we look forward from here. And I would just echo Marc's comments that there's a range around that. It could be low double digit. It could be mid to high teens in any one year, but we manage that based on the opportunities to grow the platform in view of when we think the revenue will come. Great. So just I'll just put some -- a bit more color around that. We typically raise -- away from a year when we're reaching a big flagship fund in PE, we typically raise somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion of third-party capital. And then in addition to that, we have organic growth at the insurance platforms plus we have insurance M&A. And then we have further deployment of assets in our insurance platforms as we reposition their balance sheets. So without any, sort of, unusually large M&A, without any flagship you're in the range of $40 billion to $50 billion a year give or take, and then with upside from there driven by the other two components. Yeah, Jeremy, we're virtually through the delay in realizations resulting from the impairment. In my comments, I referred to a $0.06 delay. So the next $0.06 of what would otherwise be no carry coming out is to the LPs. And then after that, we're in the clear. And so any monetizations from them will create carry. I think the further benefit is as Fund IX continues to invest, and as Scott mentioned, with a healthy pipeline in front of us, and now being in carry we have a good line of sight into multiple years of Fund VIII realizations, with Fund IX tacking on to the back end of that. So the clawback is not an issue. It's specific to old funds. It's not specific to Fund VIII at all and so that's not an issue in terms of realizations. So I think as we look forward, there's a ramp in front of us to get through into what we see as a more normalized monetization period and carry coming through the PE business."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. Good morning everyone. I'm excited to be here following the conclusion of my very poorly planned recent sabbatical. I look forward to engaging with our investors and shareholders as I transition into my new role. As you will hear in more detail the Apollo platform is strong, resilient, extremely well-positioned for growth in today's landscape as our exceptional 2020 results have demonstrated. Before I turn to the quarter and the year, I want to review the announcements that were contained in the various communications last week. I will first touch on governance, then leadership, and lastly our investors. In terms of governance, we believe the changes described in Leon's letter last week were an important step in our evolution from a private partnership to the standard set by the best public companies. Our industry is in transition. Our firm is in transition. All of us are moving from the small private partnerships that we started life as to important components of a more global financial system. Proper governance and transparency are going to be essential to play the role that we are supposed to play in this marketplace. Specifically as a firm, we are committed to moving promptly to a governance structure that will enhance our Board with additional diversity, possessing different viewpoints to bring experience to bear that is needed to help drive our business forward. We are committed to moving our Board to two-thirds independent over the near-term and we are committed to appointing a lead independent Director who will actively and regularly engage with the management and the Board. As it relates to Directors, we have already made substantial progress. Last week we announced that Pam Joyner and Sid Mukherjee will be joining our Board effective March 1st. Further, we are in active dialogue to bring additional high-quality talent on board to help us drive the business forward at our Board of Directors level. Beyond the Board changes, as we have alluded to we have begun a process with our independent committee of the Board to promptly evaluate and review the steps necessary for Apollo to adopt a one share one vote structure and other changes that will be required to be eligible for us to be included in a broader set of market indices. These changes I believe would be incredibly beneficial for our firm and again further reflect our commitment to moving to a more modern state given the important role that we play in the financial landscape. I believe the independent committee of the Board will return promptly with their recommendations and we will take it from there. Away from the governance changes, we are making a series of changes to Apollo's leadership. Leon will be retiring as CEO and will remain Chairman of the Board. Josh will remain a co-Founder and member of the Board and Executive Committee working with our largest investors, evolving our integrated platform, and expanding the strategic opportunities where we look for investments. Scott and Jim will be assuming additional responsibilities as we all realign our areas of focus. We are fortunate to have an incredibly deep bench of talented partners who have been together a very long time. Leon, Josh and I have been together and been partners for more than 30 years. We have been through all kinds of market cycles and all kinds of events and I expect our partnership to endure for a very long time. Having reviewed governance and leadership let me now turn to speak about our investors. This has been a busy week plus of communication with our investors. We have had an opportunity to speak with a very broad cross-section of our limited partners and their advisers and consulting relationships regarding the conclusion of the Conflicts Committee review and the governance and leadership changes. The vast majority have indicated that they are satisfied with the announcements, which they and we believe strike the right balance for the firm. Perhaps most importantly, they appreciated the seriousness with which we took the process and the transparency. As we expected, a smaller portion of our investors will need time to consider these events and the changes we are implementing. And in some instances they may actually want to see how these changes unfold. We realize that we may not be able to satisfy each and every of more than our 100 -- excuse me, 1,500 institutional investors, but we have made tremendous progress. We must continuously strive to improve our process and governance and most importantly to deliver superior investment returns to our investors. We expect third-party fundraising to build significantly now that we have addressed these issues. The strength of the business shows that even in this past quarter with these headwinds we continue to raise money across a number of funds and syndicated more than $9 billion of investments amongst our limited partners and insurance affiliates. As I said the business powers ahead. As Josh will discuss, this was a record year for Apollo across multiple metrics. AUM is at a record high, increasing by more than $22 billion in this quarter alone. The momentum in this business is strong and as we implement these various changes, I expect that momentum to increase. Now to take a step back. This is a unique time for me to become CEO of Apollo. We are a growth business and we are fortunate to be a provider of a service that's an incredibly high demand namely investment returns. In addition to the product, we provide our market is growing and it's growing dramatically. We primarily serve retirees either directly through our insurance affiliates in the form of guaranteed income or indirectly with our yield in opportunistic products through institutions like retirement systems, pension plans, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and others. All of these clients we serve are looking for investment returns. And it is our job to continue to grow our front-end, meaning, our ability and capacity to generate good returns per unit of risk assumed. While the AUM growth this year is nothing short of substantial and spectacular, growing AUM is just a measure and not a goal in itself. It is the result of good performance. For good managers like Apollo, the ability to raise money is not the primary governor of our growth. It is our capacity in difficult markets to source investments that provide above-average returns for the risks undertaken. As long as we maintain our capacity and grow our capacity to produce returns, AUM will follow. I feel fortunate to be leading an incredibly healthy business. I believe we have a unique opportunity Apollo -- at Apollo based on the strength of our people coupled with our investment expertise across numerous sectors and the benefit of our permanent capital vehicles. We are strategically positioned at the intersection of growth yield and value. Our particular edge is being able to source assets that cater to a range of capital structures from lower yield insurance company balance sheets to high-return opportunity funds. In a market that is characterized by indexation, correlation and volatility. I believe that presents a unique opportunity for Apollo style of investing to really stand out. An Apollo portfolio is fundamentally different than a BlackRock portfolio a Blackstone portfolio or anyone else's portfolio. The unique skill -- unique DNA of Apollo is to source investments up and down the risk-reward spectrum that represent good returns per unit of risk undertaken. So long as we stick to that tenet, we will continue to be successful and we will continue to grow our firm. I would be remiss not to take a moment to thank Apollo's more than 1,500 employees around the world. They have worked tirelessly in a very difficult year to achieve the impressive results we have announced today. I'm extremely proud of the extraordinary team, their perseverance and dedication they have demonstrated throughout this very interesting year. With that I turn it over to Josh to cover our strong results for the year. Okay. You touched on some of it, but I'll start with, how I think. The limit on our growth, which you're referring to, is not the ability to raise money. It's the ability to deploy it sensibly, in an Apollo-esque manner. In the private equity business, we are large. We will continue to grow, but you're right, that will not be a source of massive growth. The credit business is large, in a sense that we talk about. But in the context of the markets that we participate in, we're just beginning. We have an amazing opportunity in credit, particularly with respect to origination. In the real estate market which you also touched on, we have an immense real estate footprint. We simply don't group it in our financials or in our assets, because much of what we do in the real estate business is in yield, rather than an opportunity. We are building the real estate business. The real estate business is raising funds in the US opportunity market, in the Asian opportunity market, in the net lease market, in the debt market and in the core plus market. On every one of our insurance company balance sheets real estate is an expanding category. And I would expect our real estate business to increase. We have a lot of white space, but it has to be done in an Apollo-esque way. Infrastructure, Infrastructure 1, double-digit rates of return in the infrastructure market, back out in the market with infrastructure 2, again, an area that I expect to expand in a big way impact, exactly the same thing. Every one of these funds, the thing that ties them together, is not the desire to simply go out and raise AUM, but the identification of an opportunity that we believe, reflects Apollo. The Apollo investment brand fundamentally, means that we believe we are taking less risk, per unit of return, at every point in the capital structure from investment-grade down to the most opportunistic. To -- maybe I'll drone on for one more second. I think one of the biggest opportunities we have is to massively expand our front-end, which is our capacity to generate returns. This is bringing on board teams. This is buying in platforms. This is also building organically, from initiatives already underway within Apollo. I'll stop there. So, we'll break Craig into, -- I'll give you an initial response, and then, I'll turn it over to Martin. So as I mentioned, we have asked our independent committee to promptly study and give us recommendations with respect to moving to one share one vote, and the other changes necessary to be eligible for broad index inclusion which would include a full C-corp conversion. I would expect we will hear back from them, no later than our next conference call. With that -- as to the specific steps, I'll turn it over to Martin. Okay. So I'll hit it up front. As to the specific strategies, I'll turn to Scott and Jim to talk about the strategies that are active in the market and where we think we're going to make the most progress in 2021. We've done a lot of limited partner and consultant calls. That's just \u2013 not just me. That's the entirety of our team. The vast majority of feedback from the LPs and consultants to date has been positive. They appreciate the seriousness and transparency and thought that we have put into this process. ESG are not just three initials to them or to us. This is something that we have to live every day. They have acknowledged that the report by Dechert substantiated what we told them, no involvement by Apollo or its employees and no wrongdoing on Leon's part. And they've commended us on the actions we've taken with respect to the governance changes and the succession planning. For the vast majority of LPs that will be enough. They think we've struck the right balance. For some LPs as I've said, they will want to see how these changes develop. And for some they will want to see these changes fully implemented. I do not believe that there is a specific characteristic across limited partners who perhaps are fully satisfied versus those who are less than fully satisfied at this point in time. But I will note with $455 billion of AUM and 1,500 institutional investors, something is happening in our funding business almost every day. In the fourth quarter, a number of people hit pause simply to wait to see the outcome. I believe in the first quarter we will see some of that pause simply come through and then we will get stronger every day. As to the specific products, why don't I start with Scott and then Scott will hand it to Jim. Okay. Why don't I take that? So clearly in hindsight taking a sabbatical in the middle of pandemic is a very bad idea. First, I went nowhere and I did nothing. But in some sense it actually accomplished everything it was supposed to accomplish. The first half of 2020, I worked like an associate, new to a firm. We closed two of the largest insurance transactions in the insurance marketplace. And by the end of June, I needed a little bit of a break. And when I say it accomplished what it was supposed to accomplish with me sitting there every day the team that is way smarter than I am, that really makes things happen in the insurance business, never got to spread their wings. We now \u2013 with six months to have passed, we've settled into a routine that is completely sustainable, where I am involved in those things that add value where I can add value but where the day-to-day responsibility is in the hands of people, who as you will meet them in our various investor presentations, you will come to the same conclusion that I have which it gets better once you get past me. As it relates to FRE margins, I'll put it in the context of more of our five-year plan. 15 months ago, we sponsored an Investor Day. And I believe, when we rolled out the target, and we said $600 billion of AUM, I was watching the audience a number of faces dropped and thought that goal was unsustainable or unrealistic. 15 months later, we're halfway toward that target. The outcome of that target, since AUM is the fundamental driver of revenue is mid-double-digit growth for a very long period of time. As to growth and investment, in any particular year, it is not the revenue or the AUM that I so much focus on, or that you should be focused on. The decision in any given year as to whether we will grow double digit low or double-digit high will be primarily driven by the pace of investments in the front end, and we balance that very carefully. As you've heard me say already, I believe, we are in a growth business. We serve people, who are desperate for yield. Our institutional business is growing. Our insurance business is growing. Our retail business is growing. We need to make sure, we grow the front end, consistent with the AUM potential we have, rather than focus on growing AUM. Hopefully that answers your question. So I'm going to start and then I'm going to turn it I guess to Martin. I think it's important to understand, how we come at this holistically. So there is Athene and Athora deal volume. But as you know we are in the re-tech market every day. This year organic growth at just Athene, north of $20 billion. We are among the largest providers of alternative asset services in the retail marketplace. We elect to do that though in the form of guaranteed income rather than in the form of funds. We can at a later date explore the efficiency of that. When we start a new fundraise, no matter, which fund it is, we start with a very important anchor relative to almost anyone else in our marketplace. And that anchor is our massive permanent capital vehicles. They are as you know mostly allocated to yield alternatives, which is high grade. In fact yield alternatives, which is how their business runs but roughly 5% of their portfolio is allocated to alternatives. Making sure that we deliver adequate alternative assets to our insurance platforms is a very important part of achieving the overall returns of the insurance company and it actually has a second benefit. It aligns us to a much greater degree with our investors in that we own in some instances 15% or 20% of a new alternatives fund relative to what a GP commitment might be. So with that intro, I will then turn over to Martin. Perfect. Jim, why don't you take that? Okay. Again, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Jim and Scott. And first, thank you for your comments and I look forward to -- at our next Investor Day exploring what I'm about to say in more detail. But to be provocative, I believe we're going to see more change in our industry over the next five years than we have in the past 10.  If you step away and just think about what's happened, we've had a decade-plus of financial repression where investors who were relying on a certain set rate of guaranteed return or fixed income return have been unable to achieve that and they've been pushed further and further out on the risk spectrum to try and achieve any kind of normal return. To date that return has been met because we've been in a very interesting market.  At the same time, what we've seen is, we've seen two other -- perhaps three other really big trends. Trend one is indexation. The more and more market gets indexed the more things fall out of an index and create interesting opportunity. Second is correlation. And the third is volatility as we're seeing in spades in this market. All three, I believe present interesting opportunities for us to invest around, for us to augment our franchise in ways perhaps unexpected. And with that I'll see if Scott wants to add anything. Sure. Why don't I hand that to Jim to start? Okay. It's Marc. I'll start with your second question and work backwards, which is to say ,I'm not going to steal Athene's thunder. They will be announcing results on the 17th. But in the commentary they've made to date, I know they are very pleased with how things are going. And some of the transactions that both Jim and Josh alluded to were anchored by our insurance company balance sheets both in the US and in Europe. Competition in any market is inevitable. People have seen now what we have built over the last 11 or 12 years and I assure you that we have paid substantial tuition. Buying something is not the same as integrating your business with an insurance company. Every morning at Apollo there are 150 people who wake up and do nothing other than insurance. The plumbing, the piping, the understanding of how assets get onboarded onto an insurance company balance sheet is different than making investments in insurance. It's different than managing money for insurance companies. It's a fundamentally different skill set. To delve in perhaps more than you wanted to what we have succeeded in doing in the insurance business is to create a virtuous circle. Insurance is a capital-intensive business. Every time you grow in insurance, you have to raise capital to support that growth from a regulatory point of view. What we have done is we have gotten to be so large and so profitable that we generate significant amounts of internal capital, so that we are able to continue to grow without necessarily raising new capital. If we want to grow really fast, yes, we augment the balance sheet by again integrating limited partners or integrating specific funds into our insurance company acquisitions. But it all starts with having a profitable insurance business. If you look at our public entity Athene, Athene has grown north of 15%, since inception, in terms of earnings. Any growth, any asset management has to be good for the underlying client, whether that client is a limited partner, whether that client is a retail investor or whether that client is an insurance company. This is all about balance and I'll come back to where Jim ended and where I started. We are not limited in our growth by the amount of money that can be raised. With our -- that's not true for every fund and every product. But across our platform, if we want to raise more money, we can be more aggressive in the reinsurance market. We can be more aggressive in the retail market. We can be more aggressive in the FABN market and so on and so on and so on. What we need to do is we need to have growth of the front end consistent with growth in the back end, because for an insurance company, particularly in the businesses that we're in, it's about earning adequate spread on a risk-adjusted basis. For our institutional and retail clients, it's about earning adequate return for the risk they undertake. The limiter of our growth is not our ability to raise AUM from any source. It is the ability to scale the front end of our business which should be our primary focus. And if we're good at that, AUM will take care of itself. Hopefully that answers your question."

            "name": "Scott Kleinman",
            "content": "Sure. So look on the opportunistic side, as Marc touched on a little bit earlier, we're in the market now with infrastructure with Asian real estate with impact. We are \u2013 we have raised and continue to raise additional SPACs. We'd expect to see more of that. We have some new products that we're working on that in all likelihood will be coming out in a meaningful way this year as well. On the credit side, a number of evergreen funds that are \u2013 have been fundraising and continue to fundraise large-cap originations that often syndicate to our LPs as well. So quite a bit of activity expected for 2021. Sure. So, look, as I've said in the past, market indexes aren't necessarily a good indicator of what's going on across the breadth of the market. The pipeline in the PD business is really stronger now than it's been at any time even through the crisis. And so, I would expect, if I had to estimate a bigger-than-average deployment year in private equity this year, just based on what we're seeing and what we have teed up even in the short to medium term. So, I actually think deployment across private equity, hybrid value, a number of our other opportunistic funds, notwithstanding the market backdrop is still incredibly strong. As far as your question around SPACs, look, we ultimately see SPACs, as an interesting asset class. It is not a flash in the pan. SPACs are here to stay for a lot of fundamental reasons. In some respects, is it competition? Sure, but we've always had competition. If anything, Apollo has now proven our ability to successfully issue SPACs. We've issued a number. We have several more in the pipeline and see it as a real opportunity to add to the asset category footprint that we have. And I think, you'll continue to see that be an increasing part of how we approach the market across the spectrum of risk and return. Yes. Look, I think as we continue to grow into geographies, into products, into sectors, we're always looking at can we build it ourselves, can we bolt on small teams or do we have to take larger steps and make more sizable acquisitions. And so all of that's completely on the table. And as we just pursue these different options, I think you'll see more of a mix of all of that going forward."

This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo\u2019s most recent SEC filings, including the 8-K Apollo filed this morning for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo\u2019s earnings presentation, which is available on the company\u2019s website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in Apollo Fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you and your families are doing well in these challenging times. Joining me this morning are Leon Black, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Josh Harris, Co-Founder; and Martin Kelly, Chief Financial Officer and Co-Chief Operating Officer. In addition, Marc Rowan, Co-Founder; and Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman; our Co-President\u2019s will be available for Q&A on this morning\u2019s call. Earlier this morning, we reported distributable earnings of $0.47 per common share, pretax fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.63 per share and we declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share for the third quarter. We\u2019ll open today\u2019s call with comments on our business and our quarterly earnings from Josh Harris and Martin Kelly. And then we\u2019ll move to a personal statement from Leon Black regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Leon\u2019s remarks will be the extent to which this matter will be discussed in light of the review, the independent review is currently underway. As we have continuously stated, Apollo never did any business with Jeffrey Epstein. We as a firm are appalled by Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s horrific acts and despicable conduct. Following Leon\u2019s statement, Martin, Josh, Mark, Jim and Scott will be available to answer questions about our business and performance this quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Josh.\nJosh Harris: Thanks, Gary. I clearly echo your sentiments on behalf of our firm. And believe the conflicts committee review is an important step. Thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. I hope we continue to find you in good health. And to our employees, thank you very much for another quarter of hard work and dedication, which has resulted in strong results for our clients and shareholders. Starting with the investing environment, the equity markets remain ahead of fundamentals. The swift pace of economic recovery that we saw in the second quarter and into the third quarter has more recently slowed. As a result of low rates and the overvalued public markets, global investor demand for private market opportunities remains strong. Now withstanding high valuation, Apollo continues to source attractive risk return investments for our clients through selective market opportunities in credit, private equity and real assets. In the third quarter, Apollo continued to demonstrate the strength of our platform. For the nine months ended September 30, we achieved AUM growth of 31%, FRE revenue growth of 17% and FRE growth of 16% \u2013 revenue growth of 17% and FRE growth of 16%. For the third quarter AUM increased to $433 billion, and we reported FRE of $0.63 per share, a record for Apollo. Year to date asset under magic growth of $102 billion was largely due to growth of our insurance clients through strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth, specifically insurance accounted for $82 billion in inflows year to date. The large majority of which is fee generating immediately. Athene and Athora have now reached $238 billion and permanent capital vehicles now represent 60% of our asset base, while over 90% of our assets under management are either permanent in nature or has a contractual life of five years or more from inception. We believe that this long dated capital base gives us an advantage on the capital deployment side and provides resiliency for our FRE in all market environments. While increasingly our peers are focusing on insurance, we continue to believe that our platform has a number of advantages that make us the premier player in the space. Our insurance affiliates are well-capitalized, having raised over $18.5 billion of equity capital, which allows them to target large and transformative transactions. Just this week, it was announced at Venerable to Apollo help create will buy a variable annuity block from equitable that has total assets of approximately $35 billion, roughly doubling the size of Venerable. This transaction has limited direct impact to Apollo\u2019s financial results. It speaks to our expertise across insurance segments. As we consider the big themes of investing over the last several years, financials, particularly insurance is a key focus of our firm. And as such, we have approximately 150 investment professionals focused on the sector, providing a broad set of capabilities across U.S. and European spread variable, property and casualty and life settlements. Additionally, as we sit at the crossroads of providing yield for our investors and capital solutions for companies in need of liquidity, we have developed extensive asset management capabilities, including a large and growing direct origination business. This expertise spans middle-market and large cap origination and a number of asset based lending categories that benefit our insurance and third-party clients. One example of our leading origination platform is a sizable transaction, we completed this quarter with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company or ADNOC, in which Apollo sourced structured and executed investment for our clients in a $5.5 billion real estate portfolio. This was an investment grade transaction that was placed with our insurance and third-party clients looking for long-term yield \u2013 long-term and high quality yield. Given the sustained low rate environment, the size and strength of our asset management and origination capabilities, current organic growth trends and our acquisition capabilities, we expect continued growth in these insurance platforms. In addition to the strong growth we\u2019ve seen in insurance, we\u2019ve made progress in a number of other business initiatives. This year, we launched a $12 billion large cap direct origination strategy, and now start impact investing platform and listed a pause strategic growth capital speck. Additionally, we\u2019ve continued to grow our existing strategies such as Accord, Hybrid Value, infrastructure and our total return strategy to name a few. In terms of third-party fundraising, we closed on $3.9 billion of third-party capital in the quarter, highlighted by number of first closures, including Hybrid Value two, an Accord four, and our new infrastructure opportunities strategy. These and other strategies have resulted in a strong year-to-date third-party fundraising of $18.4 billion through the end of the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect that third-party fundraising will slow over the near-term as some investors await the findings of the review, which Leon will discuss. Martin will also provide additional color on the potential impact to revenues. Before I turn the call over to Martin, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for those responsible for our strong earnings. Our employees, led by our impressive global leadership team, including Co-President\u2019s Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman, who are here with me today are 14 person management committee and our leadership advisory forum of 60 senior global professionals. With each day that passes, I\u2019m increasingly impressed by the commitment and the collaboration of our Apollo team towards one another and our business. Thank you again for all of your hard work. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Martin to cover some financial highlights of the quarter in greater detail.\nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Josh. I\u2019d like to echo Josh\u2019s appreciation for all our employees, who continuing hard work is very much appreciated by our senior management team. For the third quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.51 per share, fully supported by our after-tax FRE. Our reliable FRE stream supports a dividend at a level above our stated minimum of $0.40 per quarter. Any quarters have more meaningful transaction fees the dividend can be substantially higher even without the benefit of performance fees. We generated FRE of $0.63 per share on a pre-tax basis for the quarter driven by growth in management fees and some higher transaction fees. Management fees were up 6% over the prior quarter and 13% over the third quarter of 2019, driven by growth in fees for investing the assets of our insurance clients, growth in new businesses described by Josh and deployment across the platform broadly. Transaction and advisory fees was $72 million for the quarter driven by capital solutions transactions and private equity activity. The increasing compensation costs reflects our continued investment in building our capabilities across the areas of growth that Josh highlighted, including an infrastructure, our hybrid capital business and FIG platform, as well as in technology and various business support functions across the firm. Our FRE margin for the third quarter was 55% in line with our year to date margin and with our full year 2019 margin. We continue to anticipate that for the full year 2020, our margin will remain in the range of mid-50s, reflecting low double digit revenue growth, balanced against the significant investments we are making across the Apollo platform. Specifically, we\u2019ve invested over $100 million over the last two years in establishing new businesses, growing existing businesses and building technology and support teams around those businesses, all while maintaining our industry-leading FRE margins. Turning to incentive realizations. We continue to experience very low realized performance fees in the third quarter as gains from monetization activity in Fund VIII were refunded to LPs as a result of the impairments recognized in the first half of 2020. At the end of the third quarter, the netting hole and Fund VIII has been reduced to $650 million from $1.1 billion. We expect the gross realized performance fees will be negligible over the remainder of 2020 and the early part of 2021. As portfolio companies manage the impacts of COVID on their operations and the return of LP capital in Fund VII is prioritized. Turning to AUM. We ended the third quarter at $423 billion reflecting 5% growth quarter-over-quarter and 34% growth year-over-year. Inflows totaled $13 billion for the quarter, reflecting organic growth at Athene as well as fundraising for a number of strategies, including Accord Hybrid Value and infrastructure. For the third quarter fee generating AUM grew by 2% quarter-over-quarter and 38% year-over-year to $326 billion supported by inflows and capital deployment. Turning to deployment. Investment activity across the platform return to more normalized levels this quarter, consistent with the continued recovery in the markets, following the fed stimulus actions. During the third quarter deployment in our drawdown funds was at $2 billion compared to our average pace of $4 million to $5 million per quarter. However, our pipeline across the platform remains robust with a number of transactions in what we believe to be the lightest stages of our underwriting process. During the first and second quarters of this year, we provided information on our gross buying activity across the platform. The purpose of this metric was to provide an indication of the breadth of our activity levels in a volatile market. Recognizing the evolution and breadth of our platform beyond our drawdown funds and to provide an indication of our net investing and origination activity, we\u2019re introducing an expanded deployment measure to supplement our historical equity drawdown deployment measure. In addition to equity deployment in drawdown funds, this metric includes all net purchases and originations across our businesses, including on behalf of their insurance clients, evergreen funds, managed accounts and across our yield platforms. In the third quarter, this expanded deployment measure was $21 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, it was $65 billion. This measure is trending modestly ahead of last year as the components of our yield business continued to expand. Additional disclosure around this expanded view of deployment is available in our earnings release in total and for each segment. Moving on to investment performance during the third quarter, our private equity funds portfolio appreciated by 8% due to strong performance across all funds public, and private holdings. Fund VIII appreciated by 10% driving an increase in the net carry asset to $0.76 per share. Fund VIII is now marked at a multiple of invested capital of 1.5 times. It\u2019s important to note that the Fund VIII is in full carry and the net carry asset is fully realizable at current markets. The impairment of all resulted in acceleration of proceeds to the Fund LPs, but does not change the value of the net carry asset. It is also important to note that the clawback is independent of Fund VIII and primarily related to legacy funds, which we expect to monetize over multiple years. Fund V, for example, a 2001 vintage fund is still open and has clawback. On a year-to-date basis, through the end of the third quarter, our private equity funds portfolio is down by only 5%, which compares favorably to the performance of the S&P value index down 13%. The portfolio remains in good shape overall, despite the challenging economic environment. And we remain confident in our platforms ability to generate meaningful realized returns overtime. We have not experienced any impairment beyond those recognized in the second quarter. In credit, our fund\u2019s aggregate portfolio appreciated by 3.7% during the quarter. Notably on a year-to-date basis, our global corporate credit business has generated a 2.4% total return, reflecting 300 basis points of outperformance to its benchmark. In addition, the performance of loans in our credit portfolio exceeded the S&P Leveraged Loan Index by 140 basis points year-to-date through September 30. Higher bond performance exceeded to be a high yield index by over 800 basis points for the same period. And our credit strategies fund continues to perform very well is up 18% for the year through September 30. In real assets, our overall return for the quarter was 3.4% driven by broad appreciation across the portfolio, and as you continued to have a diminimous effects on our portfolio performance in both private equity and credit this quarter. Our net economic balance sheet value at the end of the third quarter after debt and preferred equity financing obligations was approximately $3.26 per share, growing meaningfully from the prior quarter. Our net performance fee receivable increased to $1.05 per share supported by this strong performance across the platform. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. Our dry powder for investments across the fund complex was $46 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting fundraising activity during the quarter offset by capital deployment. Let me spend a moment on the durability of our AUM in light of the current review and any impacts on fundraising. We believe our AUM is durable and consequently, our FRE is resilient. With 60% of our AUM in permanent capital vehicles, and over 90% of our AUM in permanent capital vehicles, all funds with five years or longer from inception, our revenue base is less susceptible to redemption. Only 3% of our AUM is able to be redeemed from funds that we managed within a 24-month period. And managed accounts have customized and have a variety of redemption features. Despite our progress in fundraising, which Josh commented on earlier, we expected some investors might look to pause do investments to new commitments to Apollo over the near term, at least until the independent review being conducted by the Conflicts Committee has been completed. To put our fundraising in context, our typical third-party capital raising has been in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion on an annual basis and it has been $18.4 billion year-to-date through September 30, with a further significant contribution from organic growth and strategic transactions from our insurance clients\u2019 $82 billion to-date in 2020. Even in what we believe to be the very unlikely event of no third-party fundraising through 2021, but as a way to book and the potential impact, the combined effects of annualization of that robust growth in 2020 expected ongoing organic growth and redeployment of assets for our insurance clients at current fee rights and ongoing deployment of dry powder across the platform will result in revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% in 2021, assuming redemptions and transaction fees at levels consistent with 2020. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call to Leon.\nLeon Black: Good morning, everyone. This is Leon Black. I hope you and your families are safe, healthy, and doing well despite these extraordinary and difficult times. As I have noted before, this is Apollo\u2019s 31st year of doing business and I am extremely proud of our team and everything we have accomplished over the past three decades on the foundation of excellence, performance, and integrity. I want to begin today by addressing my prior business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. By nature, I am a private person and it runs counter to my nature to speak publicly about personal matters. This has been true ever since living through the press coverage of my father\u2019s suicide 45 years ago, but this matter is now effecting Apollo, which my partners and I spent 30 years building and it\u2019s also causing deep pain for my family. Knowing all that I have learned in the past two years about Epstein\u2019s reprehensible and despicable conduct, I deeply regret having had any involvement with him. With the benefit of hindsight, working with him was a horrible mistake on my part. I am not seeking to excuse that decision, but I do believe it may be helpful to convey some relevant facts. First and most important, Apollo never did any business with Epstein, neither Epstein or any company controlled by him ever invested in any funds managed by Apollo. Second, as I stated in July 2019, Epstein did provide professional services to my family partnership and related family entities involving estate planning, tax, structuring of art entities and philanthropic advice. His work extended over a period of six years from 2012 to 2017. And I paid him millions of dollars annually for that work. There exists substantial documentary support for the services provided. All of Epstein\u2019s advice was vetted by leading law firms, accounting firms, and other professional advisors. Let me be clear. There has never been an allegation by anyone that I engaged in any wrongdoing because I did not. And any suggestion of blackmail or any other connection to Epstein\u2019s reprehensible conduct is categorically untrue. Third, I would like to provide some chronological context regarding my decision to do business with Epstein. I first met Epstein around 1996. At the time, Epstein was advising prominent clients on the state tax matters and his network of relationships included luminaries I respected and admired, including several heads of state, heads of prominent families and finance, a U.S. Treasury Secretary, accomplished business leaders, Nobel Laureates, acclaimed academicians and noted philanthropist. Epstein had just been named a trustee of Rockefeller University. He was also a member of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. I was not aware of Epstein\u2019s criminal conduct until it was publicly reported that Epstein was being investigated by Florida State and federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials beginning in late 2006. In 2009, after being released from jail, Epstein returned to his previous financial advisory activities. And once again began working and associating with many prominent individuals, spanning the worlds of finance, academia, science, technology, philanthropy, business, and government. The distinguished reputations of these individuals gave me misplaced comfort in retaining Epstein services in 2012 for my personal estate planning, tax structuring and philanthropic advice. Like many other people I respected, I decided to give Epstein a second chance. This was a terrible mistake. I wish I could go back in time and change that decision, but I cannot. Had I known any of the facts about Epstein sickening and repulsive conduct, which I learned in late 2018, more than the year after I stopped working with them, I never would have had anything to do with him. I understand and appreciate that concerns remain. For that reason, at last week\u2019s Apollo Board Meeting, I requested that the Board\u2019s Conflicts Committee comprised of three independent directors retain outside counsel to conduct a thorough review of and independently confirm the information I have conveyed about my prior professional dealings with Epstein. I strongly believe that such an independent review is in the best interest of Apollo, our employees, our shareholders, and our LPs. I look forward to the results of the independent review. I believe it will assure all of our stakeholders that they have the relevant facts and demonstrate that everything I have said about my relationship with Epstein is accurate and truthful. The review is now underway and I am cooperating fully. Out of respect for that process, I do not intend to provide any further details today or respond to questions concerning the matters under review, by the Conflict Committee and its counsel. I look forward to the committee completing its work and releasing its conclusions expeditiously. Finally, I too would like to add my support for Apollo\u2019s 1,500 employees who work tirelessly to achieve the best possible returns on behalf of all our valued investors. I am extremely proud of the extraordinary breadth and depth of talent we have built at the firm, which I believe is the best in the industry. I also greatly appreciate the fortitude they have demonstrated over the past few weeks. With that, I thank you for your patience and we\u2019ll now turn it over to our senior leadership team for questions and answers to discuss our strong quarterly earnings.\nGary Stein: Thanks. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks for today. Can you please open up the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Before my question, I wanted to hear your perspective on how Apollo\u2019s clients have been reacting to the press reports, including the New York Times article that focused on Leon\u2019s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. And we saw comments from Cambridge and piercers, but I did not see any comments from your larger strategic investors. Thank you.\nJosh Harris: Yes. So it\u2019s Josh, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim and Scott. And basically, we have incredibly long and durable relationships with our clients, like spanning over 30 years and we\u2019ve delivered for our clients. We\u2019re deeply in contact with them. And obviously, they\u2019re awaiting the results of the review that Leon discussed. And so but right now, we\u2019re moving forward with our clients and focused on kind of the strategies that I discussed. Jim or Scott, anything to add?\nJim Zelter: I would just add this. Listen, we\u2019re fortunate, as Scott, as Josh that we\u2019ve got thousands of global clients and we\u2019ve been an active dialogue. They are continuing to drawdown capital and allocate capital to us. We\u2019ve been very active and they support and embrace the process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you. And I thought Leon\u2019s comments were loud and clear, and I appreciate that. And it will not be a follow-up question for him on anything, I respect that. However, I do have one for you guys, on Apollo, just operationally. What kind of process I know you\u2019ve got to let them do their thing, but are we talking about a couple of months? Are we talking about all of the next 12 months? What kind of process does that need to go through? And do \u2013 what is the outcome that LPs are waiting to hear? And do you expect if the process echoes Leon\u2019s comments that we\u2019re back on the same growth plan you\u2019d been on the new capital rates front? Thanks.\nJosh Harris: Sure and I respond. So the process has being run by the Conflicts Committee, and there are independent directors on that committee. There\u2019s three independence and they have a fiduciary obligation to shareholders. And so they are running that process, that review that will involve email reviews, interviews with people and so on. The timing is a little clear. I think there\u2019s a hope that it can be completed by the end of the year. But that has the usual aspects surrounded based on how the review proceeds. So in the meantime, we\u2019re continuing to be actively engaged with LPs and we\u2019ve had some capital close just this week. We expect more capital to close in the near term. And so we\u2019re highly engaged with LPs and where we\u2019re letting that review take us course as an independent process and we\u2019ll await the results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, not no believe or too much. In addition of fundraising, and I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t know why was that \u2013 is this affecting this technical kind of the opportunities that you see out there for different kinds of employment in some markets where maybe in more competitive environments \u2013 maybe making it more difficult to engage?\nMartin Kelly: It\u2019s really not. Basically, we have a very active pipeline across private equity, real assets, infrastructure, and credit. I mean \u2013 and Scott or Jim, if you want to add any color, go for it.\nScott Kleinman: No. Yes, I\u2019ll \u2013 this is Scott. I\u2019ll just reply. No, our teams are as busy as they really have been. So this is the answer your question pretty clearly now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlex Blostein: Good morning, and I appreciate everybody\u2019s comments here. Two things, I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on, I guess, one understanding that there could be slowdown in new commitments to your guides and strategies. Do you think current situation could impact any of the potential insurance transactions that could be done on behalf of your insurance partners? So I guess that\u2019s one. And two, are there any conditions where LPs could choose to pull their commitments from funds that have already been committed or so? So in other words, not obviously, permanent capital ones, but the more longer-dated ones like private equity, et cetera. Thank you.\nJosh Harris: Sure. So yes \u2013 and to answer the first question on the insurance side, the pipeline there for everything from PRT, block positions to larger transactions is extremely busy. So I think there\u2019s a lot going on there and that will continue. As far as your second question around capital being able to be to be pulled, the answer is no. As Martin said in his comments only 3% of our capital can be withdrawn in the next 24 months. So there is really no scope for what you were trying to \u2013 what you were describing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Maybe on clawback. The clawback payable this quarter was essentially flat. Can you give us more details in terms of the path forward to climb out of clawback? And does clawback impact the way you think about take and carry going forward on future funds? Thanks.\nJosh Harris: Sure, Ken. So I made some reference to this in my comments. Carry or clawback is calculated and it is one or the other at the fund level. And so a fund that\u2019s in carry does not have any clawback associated with it. So Fund VIII is clearly in carry at $0.76 of net carry on the balance sheet. The clawback is related to legacy funds, more than half the clawback is Fund VII and then the rest of it is a variety of other funds. And it\u2019s not uncommon to have clawback towards the back end of a fund, when you have the last \u2013 the last investments that may not do as well. And in effect, there\u2019s been a slight over distribution of carry from other successful investments earlier in the fund. These things tend to have a very long life to them and so I referenced Fund V, which is 20 years old. So \u2013 and clawback is only payable when the fund is finally closed. When the loss as it is sold and the fund is liquidated that\u2019s when clawback is due. And we can choose to fund callback either through a reduction in distribution or off the balance sheet. So it has a very, very long tail to it and I don\u2019t see \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon, so I don\u2019t see it affecting carry structures and how we take carry on future funds. And it\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s just a dynamic that we manage and we\u2019re accustomed to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from William Katz with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Katz: Okay, thank you very much. Just a two-part question this morning. Martin, you had mentioned that you qualified sort of how you\u2019re spending this year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the investment cycle into next year and maybe the FRE margins on that? And then maybe a broader question around and who knows about this next week, but carried interest, tax, if that were to actually rise, what if any impact it might have on earnings? Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Sure. So I referenced, about $100 million of spend over two years. We\u2019ve been in a period of time when we\u2019ve been investing in the platform and we\u2019ve talked about that a fair amount. Roughly speaking that breaks down into a third investing in growing our opportunistic businesses, a third into growing our yield businesses and a third into growing the support functions around the firm for those businesses and further reasons. So I would not anticipate the pace of investment that we\u2019ve been on continuing at those levels, although we\u2019re continuing to look at opportunities in front of us and invest, where we see areas for growth. And then on the tax point, it\u2019s hard to know at this stage what the bill or any bill might look like and there so many potential components to it. If tax rates increase \u2013 if corporate tax rates increase and of course that will increase our overall tax rate at the company level. An increase in taxes on carry doesn\u2019t affect the firm\u2019s earnings and we don\u2019t see that affecting comp and comp structures as we look forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nChris Harris: Thanks guys. With Marc Rowan on the call, I was wondering if he could may be take a minute or two and talk about his decision to take the semi sabbatical and I would ask the question because there has been some investor speculation about whether that decision was it all related to the Epstein matter?\nMarc Rowan: Sure. This is Marc. I\u2019m happy to take that. So firm grew in the insurance business, which I spend most of my time in \u2013 more than $80 billion literally in the second quarter. I have never work that hard since I was young associate more than 30 years ago. And so I decided to take a semi sabbatical. So far it\u2019s been more semi than sabbatical. But there is an amazing team that\u2019s there. And as you saw from the pace of activity, we haven\u2019t missed a beat in the insurance business in terms of anticipation of any events, absolutely not.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Davitt: Thanks. One quick follow-up from the call and then another question on the netting hole. The 7% to 9% revenue growth, you gave that\u2019s management fee growth rate, it will not include performance fees?\nMartin Kelly: Right. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s FRE management fees.\nPatrick Davitt: And then a quick follow-up on the clawback, I think you said the netting hole was reduced, but the clawback remained the same. Could you help me understand the disconnect there?\nMartin Kelly: Yes, they are again distinct from each other. So the \u2013 the carry \u2013 the carry asset, let\u2019s just focus on Fund VIII. The carry asset on Fund VIII is based on current marks on the portfolio and if we sold everything today at the prices that we mark assets at, then we would have net carry of $0.74 a share to distribute. The impairment is not more than the timing impact. It results in a diversion of the next sales of assets and the next profits that come out of that to LPs, to sort of right size them for losses that we\u2019ve taken. But ultimately it\u2019s the sequencing versus the quantum of carry that affected by that. It\u2019s completely independent of the clawback. The clawback is not related to Fund VIII, but the impairment is and we\u2019ll work our way through the impairment as we\u2019ve been doing and as you saw in Q3. And once we clear that, there will be sort of in full distribution mode.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning. Just a question on investing philosophy. Obviously over time Apollo\u2019s established a great track record as being a leading value investor. And clearly, it feels like the public markets least are much more focused on growth than value industries in that kind of rewarding that, the pandemic has only I think accelerated that structural shift and shifts in the economy. So I\u2019m curious whether this plays at all, how you guys are thinking philosophically about the construction of funds in the intermediate term, meaning, whether you would potentially lean more towards growth areas just given that the economy is kind of being turned into has and have not world where a lot of value is by value for good reason?\nJosh Harris: So we\u2019ve set up our platform with 550-plus investors that are focused on creating idiosyncratic opportunities outside the public markets that have at discounts that create excess return on behalf for our clients. Clearly, as we\u2019re not tone deaf to the opportunities and growth. And so there is certainly \u2013 we are reorienting a little bit around like what is Apollo\u2019s \u2013 how does Apollo they play growth? And the way we\u2019re going to play growth is very similar to how we approach everything else, which is there are definitely going to be, those companies that are growing that might be a little higher multiple, that need capital, that might be for whatever reason kind of discounted, maybe it\u2019s a portfolio of assets. Maybe it\u2019s us recognizing value that others don\u2019t see. And then on the credit side clearly we increasingly whether it\u2019d be Airbnb or Expedia, or there are just a number of growth companies that need kind of credit and capital and Hybrid Value type capital that were deeply \u2013 deeply in dialog with in providing capital structure solutions for. And so I think for sure we are affected by the world and the market and we do see that as a huge opportunity for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Go back to the origination platforms and some of the investments you\u2019re making in the business there, I hope you can elaborate on that a little bit? And then we saw some headlines that you may be taking one of the platforms public through an IPO. I guess just maybe bigger picture, if you could just talk to, what the long-term aspirations are with these plans, with these portfolios platforms and how that might work in terms of feeding direct origination into your business and for clients. They are separate companies or maybe less attached, how do you see that sort of playing out?\nJim Zelter: Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Jim. We\u2019ve talked for a while on this theme over the last several years. We talked about Investor Day last year, about the evolving backdrop of lending and what\u2019s going on in the markets. And Josh alluded to the ADNOC transaction today. Obviously, the value question is sometimes pointed at our opportunistic business, but it really permeates the entirety of our business to $425 billion. So in credit as you pointed out there\u2019s a variety of areas where origination, whether it\u2019s midcap, whether it\u2019s large cap origination, whether it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing an aircraft, our commercial mortgage and resi mortgages, PK Aviation, those are all businesses and platforms that really enable us to source, analyze and execute for our insurance clients, our third-party clients together. And as we pointed out last year there is no one manner in which they are restructured. Some makes sense to be owned by the insurance affiliates because those are going to create flow for those vehicles really primarily, some have a much broader application. So from our view is that there is no one way to do it, we certainly will expect to continue. We\u2019ve been \u2013 as Josh already alluded to, there is a variety of large transactions in our pipeline that we can\u2019t announce now, but as you can see whether it was the Aeromexico dip or very similar situations like that in credit or in other areas that are critical to our growth, really \u2013 really for us it\u2019s a critical area. In terms of the name, you mentioned about one of our companies, sometimes it makes sense for us to take on third-party equity funding. The company referring to AmeriHome has had a phenomenal successful run. We thought, where the valuations were and the long-term aspirations and who owns that equity, we thought a public listing made sense. Certainly the marketplace had different view of it as of this week. But again, it\u2019s been very successful, contributed a lot of earnings and assets to us and we continue to think this is a big priority for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMike Carrier: All right. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Martin, just two clarifications. You mentioned the 79% revenue growth next year, I just wanted some context on what that included? And then on the new metric on overall deployment, I think you mentioned the $21 billion. Is that driving you something in terms of the business, whether it\u2019s higher yield like any revenues, just wondering in terms of why you guys maybe focus on that? Thanks.\nMartin Kelly: Sure, Mike. So let\u2019s start with the first question. The 7% to 9% is a combination of a number of different things. One is annualizing growth in the platform across the whole platform this year including the insurance transactions and everything else. It takes account of what we see as wind downs next year based on what we anticipate selling. It actually kind of organic growth in [indiscernible] as well as deployment activity using our existing dry powder. So that\u2019s what and I assume this transaction fees at a level similar to this year, given our emphasis on the large corporate lending business in the phase of that\u2019s generating. So that\u2019s sort of the context behind that number. It obviously doesn\u2019t take any credit for incremental capital raising from here.\nJosh Harris: Which we think is unlikely, but we wanted to give the sensitivity to everyone.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. And look at the second question is, we view it as a \u2013 I guess in the deployment as we \u2013 as we\u2019ve typically disclosed is specific to drawdown funds. And the non-drawdown funds part of our business is increasing. It\u2019s really where we\u2019re seeing less of the growth. And so we see this additional metric as an important measure of the growth of our business across the whole platform including our origination platforms, including our business for our insurance clients and our third-party clients and including the drawdown funds. So it\u2019s a \u2013 we think a more encompassing measure of the true activity levels across the platform and we\u2019ll continue to report that and speak to it going forward.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open.\nRobert Lee: Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. I did have a question on the transaction and advisory fees. I mean the \u2013 I know you had a lot of activities, it\u2019s part of they were up \u2013 they previewed last quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about underneath that \u2013 how much of that just been driven more as you kind of ramp up you\u2019re kind of your capital allocation businesses versus just spree of deployments? Just trying to get a sense how we should think of that line item migrating going forward?\nJosh Harris: Yes. Rob, it\u2019s a mix. Actually, so last quarter there was a big fee and it was related to closing some co-invest capital on a large PE transaction. And they occur from time to time as we \u2013 as we close big transactions. This quarter, it was more related to the lending business, which Jim has spoken to. But that\u2019s an important growth area for us. We view the ability to originate a very large transactions and speak to a whole transaction with that capital and then syndicate it to investors that want to take a piece of it to be \u2013 important and important to our growth. And so that the fees this quarter related more to that than sort of classic co-invest capital.\nMartin Kelly: But as we ramp that origination, whether it\u2019d be Apollo strategic partners or our large cap origination engine or otherwise, we would expect that \u2013 that, those fees would grow over time and they are, and become more predictable and sustainable.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Gary Stein for closing remarks.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As we said earlier, we hope you and your families all remain safe and healthy.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Josh Harris",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary. I clearly echo your sentiments on behalf of our firm. And believe the conflicts committee review is an important step. Thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. I hope we continue to find you in good health. And to our employees, thank you very much for another quarter of hard work and dedication, which has resulted in strong results for our clients and shareholders. Starting with the investing environment, the equity markets remain ahead of fundamentals. The swift pace of economic recovery that we saw in the second quarter and into the third quarter has more recently slowed. As a result of low rates and the overvalued public markets, global investor demand for private market opportunities remains strong. Now withstanding high valuation, Apollo continues to source attractive risk return investments for our clients through selective market opportunities in credit, private equity and real assets. In the third quarter, Apollo continued to demonstrate the strength of our platform. For the nine months ended September 30, we achieved AUM growth of 31%, FRE revenue growth of 17% and FRE growth of 16% \u2013 revenue growth of 17% and FRE growth of 16%. For the third quarter AUM increased to $433 billion, and we reported FRE of $0.63 per share, a record for Apollo. Year to date asset under magic growth of $102 billion was largely due to growth of our insurance clients through strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth, specifically insurance accounted for $82 billion in inflows year to date. The large majority of which is fee generating immediately. Athene and Athora have now reached $238 billion and permanent capital vehicles now represent 60% of our asset base, while over 90% of our assets under management are either permanent in nature or has a contractual life of five years or more from inception. We believe that this long dated capital base gives us an advantage on the capital deployment side and provides resiliency for our FRE in all market environments. While increasingly our peers are focusing on insurance, we continue to believe that our platform has a number of advantages that make us the premier player in the space. Our insurance affiliates are well-capitalized, having raised over $18.5 billion of equity capital, which allows them to target large and transformative transactions. Just this week, it was announced at Venerable to Apollo help create will buy a variable annuity block from equitable that has total assets of approximately $35 billion, roughly doubling the size of Venerable. This transaction has limited direct impact to Apollo\u2019s financial results. It speaks to our expertise across insurance segments. As we consider the big themes of investing over the last several years, financials, particularly insurance is a key focus of our firm. And as such, we have approximately 150 investment professionals focused on the sector, providing a broad set of capabilities across U.S. and European spread variable, property and casualty and life settlements. Additionally, as we sit at the crossroads of providing yield for our investors and capital solutions for companies in need of liquidity, we have developed extensive asset management capabilities, including a large and growing direct origination business. This expertise spans middle-market and large cap origination and a number of asset based lending categories that benefit our insurance and third-party clients. One example of our leading origination platform is a sizable transaction, we completed this quarter with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company or ADNOC, in which Apollo sourced structured and executed investment for our clients in a $5.5 billion real estate portfolio. This was an investment grade transaction that was placed with our insurance and third-party clients looking for long-term yield \u2013 long-term and high quality yield. Given the sustained low rate environment, the size and strength of our asset management and origination capabilities, current organic growth trends and our acquisition capabilities, we expect continued growth in these insurance platforms. In addition to the strong growth we\u2019ve seen in insurance, we\u2019ve made progress in a number of other business initiatives. This year, we launched a $12 billion large cap direct origination strategy, and now start impact investing platform and listed a pause strategic growth capital speck. Additionally, we\u2019ve continued to grow our existing strategies such as Accord, Hybrid Value, infrastructure and our total return strategy to name a few. In terms of third-party fundraising, we closed on $3.9 billion of third-party capital in the quarter, highlighted by number of first closures, including Hybrid Value two, an Accord four, and our new infrastructure opportunities strategy. These and other strategies have resulted in a strong year-to-date third-party fundraising of $18.4 billion through the end of the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect that third-party fundraising will slow over the near-term as some investors await the findings of the review, which Leon will discuss. Martin will also provide additional color on the potential impact to revenues. Before I turn the call over to Martin, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for those responsible for our strong earnings. Our employees, led by our impressive global leadership team, including Co-President\u2019s Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman, who are here with me today are 14 person management committee and our leadership advisory forum of 60 senior global professionals. With each day that passes, I\u2019m increasingly impressed by the commitment and the collaboration of our Apollo team towards one another and our business. Thank you again for all of your hard work. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Martin to cover some financial highlights of the quarter in greater detail. Yes. So it\u2019s Josh, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim and Scott. And basically, we have incredibly long and durable relationships with our clients, like spanning over 30 years and we\u2019ve delivered for our clients. We\u2019re deeply in contact with them. And obviously, they\u2019re awaiting the results of the review that Leon discussed. And so but right now, we\u2019re moving forward with our clients and focused on kind of the strategies that I discussed. Jim or Scott, anything to add? Sure and I respond. So the process has being run by the Conflicts Committee, and there are independent directors on that committee. There\u2019s three independence and they have a fiduciary obligation to shareholders. And so they are running that process, that review that will involve email reviews, interviews with people and so on. The timing is a little clear. I think there\u2019s a hope that it can be completed by the end of the year. But that has the usual aspects surrounded based on how the review proceeds. So in the meantime, we\u2019re continuing to be actively engaged with LPs and we\u2019ve had some capital close just this week. We expect more capital to close in the near term. And so we\u2019re highly engaged with LPs and where we\u2019re letting that review take us course as an independent process and we\u2019ll await the results. Sure. So yes \u2013 and to answer the first question on the insurance side, the pipeline there for everything from PRT, block positions to larger transactions is extremely busy. So I think there\u2019s a lot going on there and that will continue. As far as your second question around capital being able to be to be pulled, the answer is no. As Martin said in his comments only 3% of our capital can be withdrawn in the next 24 months. So there is really no scope for what you were trying to \u2013 what you were describing. Sure, Ken. So I made some reference to this in my comments. Carry or clawback is calculated and it is one or the other at the fund level. And so a fund that\u2019s in carry does not have any clawback associated with it. So Fund VIII is clearly in carry at $0.76 of net carry on the balance sheet. The clawback is related to legacy funds, more than half the clawback is Fund VII and then the rest of it is a variety of other funds. And it\u2019s not uncommon to have clawback towards the back end of a fund, when you have the last \u2013 the last investments that may not do as well. And in effect, there\u2019s been a slight over distribution of carry from other successful investments earlier in the fund. These things tend to have a very long life to them and so I referenced Fund V, which is 20 years old. So \u2013 and clawback is only payable when the fund is finally closed. When the loss as it is sold and the fund is liquidated that\u2019s when clawback is due. And we can choose to fund callback either through a reduction in distribution or off the balance sheet. So it has a very, very long tail to it and I don\u2019t see \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon, so I don\u2019t see it affecting carry structures and how we take carry on future funds. And it\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s just a dynamic that we manage and we\u2019re accustomed to. So we\u2019ve set up our platform with 550-plus investors that are focused on creating idiosyncratic opportunities outside the public markets that have at discounts that create excess return on behalf for our clients. Clearly, as we\u2019re not tone deaf to the opportunities and growth. And so there is certainly \u2013 we are reorienting a little bit around like what is Apollo\u2019s \u2013 how does Apollo they play growth? And the way we\u2019re going to play growth is very similar to how we approach everything else, which is there are definitely going to be, those companies that are growing that might be a little higher multiple, that need capital, that might be for whatever reason kind of discounted, maybe it\u2019s a portfolio of assets. Maybe it\u2019s us recognizing value that others don\u2019t see. And then on the credit side clearly we increasingly whether it\u2019d be Airbnb or Expedia, or there are just a number of growth companies that need kind of credit and capital and Hybrid Value type capital that were deeply \u2013 deeply in dialog with in providing capital structure solutions for. And so I think for sure we are affected by the world and the market and we do see that as a huge opportunity for us. Which we think is unlikely, but we wanted to give the sensitivity to everyone. Yes. Rob, it\u2019s a mix. Actually, so last quarter there was a big fee and it was related to closing some co-invest capital on a large PE transaction. And they occur from time to time as we \u2013 as we close big transactions. This quarter, it was more related to the lending business, which Jim has spoken to. But that\u2019s an important growth area for us. We view the ability to originate a very large transactions and speak to a whole transaction with that capital and then syndicate it to investors that want to take a piece of it to be \u2013 important and important to our growth. And so that the fees this quarter related more to that than sort of classic co-invest capital."

            "name": "Leon Black",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. This is Leon Black. I hope you and your families are safe, healthy, and doing well despite these extraordinary and difficult times. As I have noted before, this is Apollo\u2019s 31st year of doing business and I am extremely proud of our team and everything we have accomplished over the past three decades on the foundation of excellence, performance, and integrity. I want to begin today by addressing my prior business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. By nature, I am a private person and it runs counter to my nature to speak publicly about personal matters. This has been true ever since living through the press coverage of my father\u2019s suicide 45 years ago, but this matter is now effecting Apollo, which my partners and I spent 30 years building and it\u2019s also causing deep pain for my family. Knowing all that I have learned in the past two years about Epstein\u2019s reprehensible and despicable conduct, I deeply regret having had any involvement with him. With the benefit of hindsight, working with him was a horrible mistake on my part. I am not seeking to excuse that decision, but I do believe it may be helpful to convey some relevant facts. First and most important, Apollo never did any business with Epstein, neither Epstein or any company controlled by him ever invested in any funds managed by Apollo. Second, as I stated in July 2019, Epstein did provide professional services to my family partnership and related family entities involving estate planning, tax, structuring of art entities and philanthropic advice. His work extended over a period of six years from 2012 to 2017. And I paid him millions of dollars annually for that work. There exists substantial documentary support for the services provided. All of Epstein\u2019s advice was vetted by leading law firms, accounting firms, and other professional advisors. Let me be clear. There has never been an allegation by anyone that I engaged in any wrongdoing because I did not. And any suggestion of blackmail or any other connection to Epstein\u2019s reprehensible conduct is categorically untrue. Third, I would like to provide some chronological context regarding my decision to do business with Epstein. I first met Epstein around 1996. At the time, Epstein was advising prominent clients on the state tax matters and his network of relationships included luminaries I respected and admired, including several heads of state, heads of prominent families and finance, a U.S. Treasury Secretary, accomplished business leaders, Nobel Laureates, acclaimed academicians and noted philanthropist. Epstein had just been named a trustee of Rockefeller University. He was also a member of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. I was not aware of Epstein\u2019s criminal conduct until it was publicly reported that Epstein was being investigated by Florida State and federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials beginning in late 2006. In 2009, after being released from jail, Epstein returned to his previous financial advisory activities. And once again began working and associating with many prominent individuals, spanning the worlds of finance, academia, science, technology, philanthropy, business, and government. The distinguished reputations of these individuals gave me misplaced comfort in retaining Epstein services in 2012 for my personal estate planning, tax structuring and philanthropic advice. Like many other people I respected, I decided to give Epstein a second chance. This was a terrible mistake. I wish I could go back in time and change that decision, but I cannot. Had I known any of the facts about Epstein sickening and repulsive conduct, which I learned in late 2018, more than the year after I stopped working with them, I never would have had anything to do with him. I understand and appreciate that concerns remain. For that reason, at last week\u2019s Apollo Board Meeting, I requested that the Board\u2019s Conflicts Committee comprised of three independent directors retain outside counsel to conduct a thorough review of and independently confirm the information I have conveyed about my prior professional dealings with Epstein. I strongly believe that such an independent review is in the best interest of Apollo, our employees, our shareholders, and our LPs. I look forward to the results of the independent review. I believe it will assure all of our stakeholders that they have the relevant facts and demonstrate that everything I have said about my relationship with Epstein is accurate and truthful. The review is now underway and I am cooperating fully. Out of respect for that process, I do not intend to provide any further details today or respond to questions concerning the matters under review, by the Conflict Committee and its counsel. I look forward to the committee completing its work and releasing its conclusions expeditiously. Finally, I too would like to add my support for Apollo\u2019s 1,500 employees who work tirelessly to achieve the best possible returns on behalf of all our valued investors. I am extremely proud of the extraordinary breadth and depth of talent we have built at the firm, which I believe is the best in the industry. I also greatly appreciate the fortitude they have demonstrated over the past few weeks. With that, I thank you for your patience and we\u2019ll now turn it over to our senior leadership team for questions and answers to discuss our strong quarterly earnings."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Josh. I\u2019d like to echo Josh\u2019s appreciation for all our employees, who continuing hard work is very much appreciated by our senior management team. For the third quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.51 per share, fully supported by our after-tax FRE. Our reliable FRE stream supports a dividend at a level above our stated minimum of $0.40 per quarter. Any quarters have more meaningful transaction fees the dividend can be substantially higher even without the benefit of performance fees. We generated FRE of $0.63 per share on a pre-tax basis for the quarter driven by growth in management fees and some higher transaction fees. Management fees were up 6% over the prior quarter and 13% over the third quarter of 2019, driven by growth in fees for investing the assets of our insurance clients, growth in new businesses described by Josh and deployment across the platform broadly. Transaction and advisory fees was $72 million for the quarter driven by capital solutions transactions and private equity activity. The increasing compensation costs reflects our continued investment in building our capabilities across the areas of growth that Josh highlighted, including an infrastructure, our hybrid capital business and FIG platform, as well as in technology and various business support functions across the firm. Our FRE margin for the third quarter was 55% in line with our year to date margin and with our full year 2019 margin. We continue to anticipate that for the full year 2020, our margin will remain in the range of mid-50s, reflecting low double digit revenue growth, balanced against the significant investments we are making across the Apollo platform. Specifically, we\u2019ve invested over $100 million over the last two years in establishing new businesses, growing existing businesses and building technology and support teams around those businesses, all while maintaining our industry-leading FRE margins. Turning to incentive realizations. We continue to experience very low realized performance fees in the third quarter as gains from monetization activity in Fund VIII were refunded to LPs as a result of the impairments recognized in the first half of 2020. At the end of the third quarter, the netting hole and Fund VIII has been reduced to $650 million from $1.1 billion. We expect the gross realized performance fees will be negligible over the remainder of 2020 and the early part of 2021. As portfolio companies manage the impacts of COVID on their operations and the return of LP capital in Fund VII is prioritized. Turning to AUM. We ended the third quarter at $423 billion reflecting 5% growth quarter-over-quarter and 34% growth year-over-year. Inflows totaled $13 billion for the quarter, reflecting organic growth at Athene as well as fundraising for a number of strategies, including Accord Hybrid Value and infrastructure. For the third quarter fee generating AUM grew by 2% quarter-over-quarter and 38% year-over-year to $326 billion supported by inflows and capital deployment. Turning to deployment. Investment activity across the platform return to more normalized levels this quarter, consistent with the continued recovery in the markets, following the fed stimulus actions. During the third quarter deployment in our drawdown funds was at $2 billion compared to our average pace of $4 million to $5 million per quarter. However, our pipeline across the platform remains robust with a number of transactions in what we believe to be the lightest stages of our underwriting process. During the first and second quarters of this year, we provided information on our gross buying activity across the platform. The purpose of this metric was to provide an indication of the breadth of our activity levels in a volatile market. Recognizing the evolution and breadth of our platform beyond our drawdown funds and to provide an indication of our net investing and origination activity, we\u2019re introducing an expanded deployment measure to supplement our historical equity drawdown deployment measure. In addition to equity deployment in drawdown funds, this metric includes all net purchases and originations across our businesses, including on behalf of their insurance clients, evergreen funds, managed accounts and across our yield platforms. In the third quarter, this expanded deployment measure was $21 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, it was $65 billion. This measure is trending modestly ahead of last year as the components of our yield business continued to expand. Additional disclosure around this expanded view of deployment is available in our earnings release in total and for each segment. Moving on to investment performance during the third quarter, our private equity funds portfolio appreciated by 8% due to strong performance across all funds public, and private holdings. Fund VIII appreciated by 10% driving an increase in the net carry asset to $0.76 per share. Fund VIII is now marked at a multiple of invested capital of 1.5 times. It\u2019s important to note that the Fund VIII is in full carry and the net carry asset is fully realizable at current markets. The impairment of all resulted in acceleration of proceeds to the Fund LPs, but does not change the value of the net carry asset. It is also important to note that the clawback is independent of Fund VIII and primarily related to legacy funds, which we expect to monetize over multiple years. Fund V, for example, a 2001 vintage fund is still open and has clawback. On a year-to-date basis, through the end of the third quarter, our private equity funds portfolio is down by only 5%, which compares favorably to the performance of the S&P value index down 13%. The portfolio remains in good shape overall, despite the challenging economic environment. And we remain confident in our platforms ability to generate meaningful realized returns overtime. We have not experienced any impairment beyond those recognized in the second quarter. In credit, our fund\u2019s aggregate portfolio appreciated by 3.7% during the quarter. Notably on a year-to-date basis, our global corporate credit business has generated a 2.4% total return, reflecting 300 basis points of outperformance to its benchmark. In addition, the performance of loans in our credit portfolio exceeded the S&P Leveraged Loan Index by 140 basis points year-to-date through September 30. Higher bond performance exceeded to be a high yield index by over 800 basis points for the same period. And our credit strategies fund continues to perform very well is up 18% for the year through September 30. In real assets, our overall return for the quarter was 3.4% driven by broad appreciation across the portfolio, and as you continued to have a diminimous effects on our portfolio performance in both private equity and credit this quarter. Our net economic balance sheet value at the end of the third quarter after debt and preferred equity financing obligations was approximately $3.26 per share, growing meaningfully from the prior quarter. Our net performance fee receivable increased to $1.05 per share supported by this strong performance across the platform. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. Our dry powder for investments across the fund complex was $46 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting fundraising activity during the quarter offset by capital deployment. Let me spend a moment on the durability of our AUM in light of the current review and any impacts on fundraising. We believe our AUM is durable and consequently, our FRE is resilient. With 60% of our AUM in permanent capital vehicles, and over 90% of our AUM in permanent capital vehicles, all funds with five years or longer from inception, our revenue base is less susceptible to redemption. Only 3% of our AUM is able to be redeemed from funds that we managed within a 24-month period. And managed accounts have customized and have a variety of redemption features. Despite our progress in fundraising, which Josh commented on earlier, we expected some investors might look to pause do investments to new commitments to Apollo over the near term, at least until the independent review being conducted by the Conflicts Committee has been completed. To put our fundraising in context, our typical third-party capital raising has been in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion on an annual basis and it has been $18.4 billion year-to-date through September 30, with a further significant contribution from organic growth and strategic transactions from our insurance clients\u2019 $82 billion to-date in 2020. Even in what we believe to be the very unlikely event of no third-party fundraising through 2021, but as a way to book and the potential impact, the combined effects of annualization of that robust growth in 2020 expected ongoing organic growth and redeployment of assets for our insurance clients at current fee rights and ongoing deployment of dry powder across the platform will result in revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% in 2021, assuming redemptions and transaction fees at levels consistent with 2020. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call to Leon. It\u2019s really not. Basically, we have a very active pipeline across private equity, real assets, infrastructure, and credit. I mean \u2013 and Scott or Jim, if you want to add any color, go for it. Sure. So I referenced, about $100 million of spend over two years. We\u2019ve been in a period of time when we\u2019ve been investing in the platform and we\u2019ve talked about that a fair amount. Roughly speaking that breaks down into a third investing in growing our opportunistic businesses, a third into growing our yield businesses and a third into growing the support functions around the firm for those businesses and further reasons. So I would not anticipate the pace of investment that we\u2019ve been on continuing at those levels, although we\u2019re continuing to look at opportunities in front of us and invest, where we see areas for growth. And then on the tax point, it\u2019s hard to know at this stage what the bill or any bill might look like and there so many potential components to it. If tax rates increase \u2013 if corporate tax rates increase and of course that will increase our overall tax rate at the company level. An increase in taxes on carry doesn\u2019t affect the firm\u2019s earnings and we don\u2019t see that affecting comp and comp structures as we look forward. Right. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s FRE management fees. Yes, they are again distinct from each other. So the \u2013 the carry \u2013 the carry asset, let\u2019s just focus on Fund VIII. The carry asset on Fund VIII is based on current marks on the portfolio and if we sold everything today at the prices that we mark assets at, then we would have net carry of $0.74 a share to distribute. The impairment is not more than the timing impact. It results in a diversion of the next sales of assets and the next profits that come out of that to LPs, to sort of right size them for losses that we\u2019ve taken. But ultimately it\u2019s the sequencing versus the quantum of carry that affected by that. It\u2019s completely independent of the clawback. The clawback is not related to Fund VIII, but the impairment is and we\u2019ll work our way through the impairment as we\u2019ve been doing and as you saw in Q3. And once we clear that, there will be sort of in full distribution mode. Sure, Mike. So let\u2019s start with the first question. The 7% to 9% is a combination of a number of different things. One is annualizing growth in the platform across the whole platform this year including the insurance transactions and everything else. It takes account of what we see as wind downs next year based on what we anticipate selling. It actually kind of organic growth in [indiscernible] as well as deployment activity using our existing dry powder. So that\u2019s what and I assume this transaction fees at a level similar to this year, given our emphasis on the large corporate lending business in the phase of that\u2019s generating. So that\u2019s sort of the context behind that number. It obviously doesn\u2019t take any credit for incremental capital raising from here. Yes. And look at the second question is, we view it as a \u2013 I guess in the deployment as we \u2013 as we\u2019ve typically disclosed is specific to drawdown funds. And the non-drawdown funds part of our business is increasing. It\u2019s really where we\u2019re seeing less of the growth. And so we see this additional metric as an important measure of the growth of our business across the whole platform including our origination platforms, including our business for our insurance clients and our third-party clients and including the drawdown funds. So it\u2019s a \u2013 we think a more encompassing measure of the true activity levels across the platform and we\u2019ll continue to report that and speak to it going forward. But as we ramp that origination, whether it\u2019d be Apollo strategic partners or our large cap origination engine or otherwise, we would expect that \u2013 that, those fees would grow over time and they are, and become more predictable and sustainable."

            "name": "Jim Zelter",
            "content": "I would just add this. Listen, we\u2019re fortunate, as Scott, as Josh that we\u2019ve got thousands of global clients and we\u2019ve been an active dialogue. They are continuing to drawdown capital and allocate capital to us. We\u2019ve been very active and they support and embrace the process. Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Jim. We\u2019ve talked for a while on this theme over the last several years. We talked about Investor Day last year, about the evolving backdrop of lending and what\u2019s going on in the markets. And Josh alluded to the ADNOC transaction today. Obviously, the value question is sometimes pointed at our opportunistic business, but it really permeates the entirety of our business to $425 billion. So in credit as you pointed out there\u2019s a variety of areas where origination, whether it\u2019s midcap, whether it\u2019s large cap origination, whether it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing an aircraft, our commercial mortgage and resi mortgages, PK Aviation, those are all businesses and platforms that really enable us to source, analyze and execute for our insurance clients, our third-party clients together. And as we pointed out last year there is no one manner in which they are restructured. Some makes sense to be owned by the insurance affiliates because those are going to create flow for those vehicles really primarily, some have a much broader application. So from our view is that there is no one way to do it, we certainly will expect to continue. We\u2019ve been \u2013 as Josh already alluded to, there is a variety of large transactions in our pipeline that we can\u2019t announce now, but as you can see whether it was the Aeromexico dip or very similar situations like that in credit or in other areas that are critical to our growth, really \u2013 really for us it\u2019s a critical area. In terms of the name, you mentioned about one of our companies, sometimes it makes sense for us to take on third-party equity funding. The company referring to AmeriHome has had a phenomenal successful run. We thought, where the valuations were and the long-term aspirations and who owns that equity, we thought a public listing made sense. Certainly the marketplace had different view of it as of this week. But again, it\u2019s been very successful, contributed a lot of earnings and assets to us and we continue to think this is a big priority for us."

I have never work that hard since I was young associate more than 30 years ago. And so I decided to take a semi sabbatical. So far it\u2019s been more semi than sabbatical. But there is an amazing team that\u2019s there. And as you saw from the pace of activity, we haven\u2019t missed a beat in the insurance business in terms of anticipation of any events, absolutely not."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. And welcome to Apollo Global Management's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all callers will be placed in a listen-only mode, and following management's prepared remarks, the conference call will be open for questions. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings, including the 8-K Apollo filed this morning for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the Company's website. Also, note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations.\nGary Stein: Welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you and your families are doing well in these challenging times. Joining me this morning are Leon Black, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Josh Harris, Co-Founder; and Martin Kelly, Chief Financial Officer and Co-Chief Operating Officer. Gary Parr, Senior Managing Director is also on the line and will be available during the Q&A session. Earlier this morning, we reported distributable earnings of $0.46 per common share, pretax fee-related earnings or FRE of $0.59 per share and a cash dividend of $0.49 per share for the second quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Leon Black.\nLeon Black: Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to express my wishes to everyone listening that this finds you and your families healthy and safe. And to our employees who have continued to work tirelessly on behalf of our clients and our shareholders, I'd like to convey my appreciation and gratitude. We are not working under typical circumstances, to say the least. And you have all continued to go above and beyond to drive the strong results that we're reporting today. I think, this speaks to the tenacity and spirit of our employees, as well as the collaborative and adventive culture we have at Apollo. Globally, companies continue to operate in incredibly challenging circumstances as we face what started as a health crisis, but it progressed into an economic crisis as well. Across the firm, we have responded quickly to this changing landscape with a focus on engagement and operations across our investment professionals, client and product solutions teams, and enterprise solutions group, which has helped us transition into a work-from-home environment smoothly. This quarter marked the achievement of a significant milestone as the Apollo\u2019s AUM grew by approximately $100 billion to surpass $400 billion for the first time in our history. This growth was driven by Athene, Athora and strong inflows during the quarter and represents 33% growth year-over-year. With $414 billion of AUM as of June 30th, we are well on our way towards the $600 billion goal that we provided at Investor Day this past November. We continue to see robust demand for Apollo products and a strong pipeline for insurance transactions over the next few years. As a further indication of the breadth of our platform and our activity level through the pandemic, gross purchases were $45 billion across the platform in the second quarter, with some of this related to the repositioning of insurance company balance sheets. We continue to dynamically navigate through this challenging environment on behalf of all our investors. Now, I would like to spend some time talking about the remarkable depth of leadership that resides at Apollo and continues to evolve. Since our founding, we have intensely focused on the strategic growth and evolution of Apollo as a leading world-class alternative investment manager. In recent years, we\u2019ve broadened the firm's executive team, most notably by naming Scott Kleinman and Jim Zelter, as co-presidents. Scott and Jim have shown strong corporate leadership, taking on responsibility for Apollo's revenue generating and investment businesses. Additionally, we continue to elevate and hire exemplary individuals to run the day-to-day operations across all lines of our business, including credit, private equity and real assets, and our insurance platforms. Our recent hires and the evolution of our leadership structure demonstrate our commitment towards growth, progression and the ongoing modernization of our firm. Today, we are announcing that on the back of an almost unprecedented quarter, adding $80 billion of insurance assets and liabilities to the portfolios that we manage, Marc Rowan, co-founder, who oversees this area, has decided, he will take a step back from his day-to-day oversight of the business and enjoy a semi sabbatical. Marc will continue to work with Josh and I, driving the strategic direction of the firm, especially for our financial institutions and insurance-related businesses. Marc will remain a member of the Apollo Board and Executive Committee, will continue to serve on the Board and Executive Committee of Athene and will remain on the Board of Athora. Scott Kleinman will assume the day-to-day operational responsibility of leading our financial institutions and insurance activities. Jim Zelter will continue to focus on asset management and credit investment activities across our insurance clients. Together, with Gary Parr, Gernot Lohr, Matt Michelini and Jasjit Singh, they will lead a broad team of over a 100 professionals who are dedicated to our insurance clients. Josh, Marc and I maintain the utmost confidence in this team to lead us into the next phase of growth and development for these platforms and for the firm more broadly. We are excited for what the future holds. We are also actively engaging on the topics of citizenship, diversity and inclusion. We recently completed our latest annual social responsibility report, which highlights that since the inception of our ESG program in 2008, the combined efforts are resulted in more than 10 million tons of waste recycled by portfolio companies, over 1 million volunteer hours by employees of portfolio companies, and approximately $1 billion of charitable donations just to name a few achievements. We have brought on some exceptional talent to assist with our citizenship efforts, including Lauren Coape-Arnold, who joined late last year as Global Head of Citizenship. This year, we introduced a formal charitable matching program for employees, which included special initiatives for COVID with $50 million in relief effort contributions globally from Apollo, its founders and portfolio companies, and also for racial injustice reform. These initiatives were well-supported by our employee base. More recently, as tragic events have further brought the issue of systemic racial injustice in this country to the forefront, we've been spending a great deal of time listening and thinking about how we can engage to a greater degree on this issue. As leaders in the industry, we need to be honest in acknowledging that we do more to help combat these inequities. And we are committed to enhancing our diversity and inclusion strategy in all aspects of our business. We are very excited to welcome our new Head of Leadership Development and Diversity, Jonathan Simon, who joins us next month. In addition, we have expanded our existing partnerships with organizations that work with students of color and communities in need. Finally, before turning this over to Josh who will speak more extensively on the subject, you should know that I am particularly proud of the strong performance delivered by the Apollo team in the second quarter. During challenging times, Apollo has generated dramatic growth in both, AUM and FRE, in fundraising and in deployments, as well as raising the bar on social consciousness. This has truly been a prime example of grace under pressure or of the whole Apollo enterprise getting going when the going was getting to get tougher. With that, I'd like to turn this over now to Josh to provide an overview of our business operations for the first quarter. Josh?\nJosh Harris: Thanks, Leon. We are really pleased to further evolve our leadership team, and I look forward to continuing to drive growth for Apollo alongside you and Marc. Apollo has responded, as Leon mentioned, to the challenges of working through the global pandemic, exceptionally well. Our outmost priority during this time has been to focus on the health and safety of our people and their families, which include our 15 offices around the world. We have challenged ourselves to innovate and adapt to new technology and to make this work -- a remote work environment, as efficient as possible. Looking forward, we are approaching the return to office with an emphasis on ensuring the ongoing wellbeing and productivity of our employees. Now, turning to our results. Our business has done exceptionally well over the last six months. For many years, we've been making four key points about how our business would perform during a period of severe market dislocation or a recession. Number one, our FRE growth and margins would be durable and stable; two, our fundraising would be resilient and potentially accelerate, driving AUM growth; three, we would find attractive risk reward investment opportunities for our investors; and four, the majority of our markdowns in our funds portfolios would be transient. All of these are proving out during this period of time, reflecting the strength of our platform. I'd like to briefly highlight the two notable transactions that reflect our continued market leadership in serving our insurance clients. These transactions closed during the second quarter, despite a backdrop of continued market volatility and uncertainty. At the beginning of the second quarter, Athora closed on its acquisition of VIVAT. Athora\u2019s assets now stand at $60 billion. This transaction is transformative for Athora, as it creates a meaningful scale, diversifies Athora\u2019s business further geographically, and adds significant operational talent and a distribution capability to the Athora platform in the Netherlands. In addition, in June, Athene announced and closed its reinsurance transaction with Jackson National, which is the largest reinsurance transaction in recent history. Through these transactions, Athene and Athora have added $73 billion of assets. And we believe that substantial consolidation opportunities remain across the insurance industry. Following these two transactions, our insurance clients continue to have a strong capital position with over $85 billion of buying power in aggregate. This capital serves as a key strategic differentiator for our clients as they do unique asset management, transaction and origination capabilities of more than 150 employees at Apollo focused on serving them. Apollo\u2019s permanent capital vehicles now represent 60% or approximately $250 billion of our AUM. And over 90% of our AUM is either derived from permanent capital vehicles or has a contractual life of five years or more from inception. The stable base of AUM continues to underpin our durable and growing fee-related earnings, which we have successfully grown through all market environments and expect to continue to do so. For the first half of 2020, our FRE grew at 9% compared to the first half of 2019. Despite multiple periods of market dislocation and the impact of an ongoing global health and economic crisis, we continue to remain highly committed to growing FRE at a robust pace over the long run and remain very confident in our ability to achieve the goals we set for our long-term FRE growth at our Investor Day last November. Our FRE margin was 55% for the first half of 2020, in line with our 2019 FRE margin. Turning to fundraising. Total inflows during the second quarter were a robust $89 billion, inclusive of Athene and Athora growth. Over the last 12 months, total inflows have been $119 billion, a record for Apollo. This includes $73 billion of growth of insurance clients, mergers and acquisitions, $35 billion of capital raising and other inflows from our fund investors, and $11 billion from organic growth at our insurance clients. In the second quarter, the breadth of our platform\u2019s investment capabilities and strength of our global relationships with investors drove fundraising that was significantly above our average quarterly level. Notably, this momentum was achieved during a time of nearly all virtual interactions. During the quarter we announced and closed on $17.4 billion in fund commitments. Key initiatives include the launch of Apollo Strategic Origination Partners platform, which will target an emerging opportunity in the large scale direct origination solutions for high quality businesses, a market currently underserved by private credit. The origination partnership will leverage Apollo's incumbency with borrowers, utilizing our credit platforms relationships with approximately 3,300 issuers of both, corporate and sponsor-backed companies. Also contributing to inflows was a $1.75 billion close for our Accord III B. This is our dislocation strategy that we were able to launch and close within approximately eight weeks. And we are now in the market for the next series of the Accord strategies. Looking forward, we remain confident that we will be able to meet or exceed the $20 billion fundraising goal we discussed on our last earnings call, which consisted of increasing the target size for certain funds, accelerating the timeline for other fundraisers, launching new strategies to address opportunities driven by market dislocation. We are appreciative of the trust and support from both, existing and new investors as they commit to a range of strategies currently available on our platform, including our origination strategy, Accord, Hybrid Value, infrastructure, U.S. and Asia real estate, managed accounts and various evergreen strategies. During the second quarter, turning to deployment, we deployed $7.2 billion of capital across our drawdown fund. Through a shifting market landscape, we remain active looking for attractive asymmetric risk reward and investing in high-quality top of the capital structure opportunities. As public markets have recovered, driven by massive but unnecessary federal stimulus, instead of fundamentals, it's been more challenging to find these attractive risk reward opportunities. However, we have been able to successfully navigate these markets to date and are increasingly focused on providing bespoke capital solutions for brand name franchises, facing liquidity constraints or looking to capitalize on growth opportunities. Capital deployments for the quarter included originations led by our Hybrid Value and credit businesses for companies such as Expedia, Albertsons, Airbnb, MFA, Cimpress, NGL Energy and Delta. As of the second quarter Hybrid Value stood at 71% committed or invested. And we were back in the market for this strategy. These transactions highlight the benefits of our globally integrated platform and the deep pools of capital across our clients, which allow us to structure bespoke financing solutions quickly and with certainty of execution. Going forward, we believe these factors will continue to make Apollo a premier financing partner for companies, and we see a strong pipeline ahead for hybrid value, our various credit vehicles and our new strategic origination partnership. In addition, our private equity fund, Fund IX, recently closed on the $6 billion take-private transaction for Tech Data, representing the largest public to private transaction completed this year. Tech Data is a global leader in information technology distribution, which we believe is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the secular IT spending tailwinds. And we created this investment in an attractive creation multiple of approximately 7 times EBITDA prior to cost savings. As of the end of the second quarter, Fund IX has reached 40% committed or invested. Looking ahead, we remain of the view that technicals are well ahead of fundamentals, and therefore we are prepared for continued volatility and a wide range of outcomes over the coming quarters. Apollo\u2019s leading investment returns through cycles are reflective of both, our focus on preserving capital for our investors and our ability to pivot quickly and opportunistically to invest during leading market dislocations. Our private equity and credit pipelines are robust, and we believe there will be many opportunities for us to identify and capture misplaced risk on behalf of our investors in the months and quarters to come. Finally, as we have discussed in recent quarters, we remain focused on increasing the accessibility and liquidity profile of our stock. As a result of the changes made to date, we are now included in the CRISP, S&P Total Market, MSCI and Russell indices. To our existing shareholders, we are grateful that you have been along for the ride; and to our prospective new shareholders, we look forward to engaging with you. To conclude my comments, our strong results for the second quarter and first half of this year are a testament to the strength of Apollo's global integrated platform and resiliency of our team. Against a very challenging market backdrop, we have demonstrated the durability of our growing FRE and the stability of our margins. Through severe market dislocations, our funds invested meaningfully during a short window of very-attractive risk reward opportunities, creating what we believe will be a substantial value for our investors. We also demonstrated our ability to pivot quickly in reaction to shifting market landscapes and are now increasingly focused on providing capital solutions for franchise businesses. And we see a growing pipeline of private equity. We've grown our AUM at a substantial pace over last year and continue to see strong demand for our products, putting us on pace to achieve or exceed communicated goals of raising over $20 billion of new capital over the next year and being well on our way to surpassing $600 billion of AUM [Technical difficulty]\nOperator: It looks like the line has dropped off.\nMartin Kelly: I'll finish that -- he's at the tail end. I'll finish his comments and then go into mine. So being well underway to surpassing $600 billion of AUM over a five-year period and growing our FRE mid-teens average annual rate, as we outlined in last November's Investor Day. To help achieve these goals, we continue to invest meaningfully across the platform, building out our investment talent and infrastructure. So, it's Martin. I\u2019ll pick up on the comments. I\u2019d firstly like to echo Josh\u2019s appreciation for all our employees whose hard work has resulted in a seamless transition into our current remote working environment. So, on dividend, FRE&D. For the second quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.49 per share supported by our after tax FRE. Our reliable FRE stream supports the dividend at a level above our stated minimum of $0.40 per quarter. And in quarters of more meaningful transaction fees the dividend can be substantially higher, even without the benefit of performance fees. We generated FRE of $0.59 per share on a pretax basis for the quarter, driven by growth in management fees and some higher transaction fees. Transaction and advisory fees were $62 million in the quarter, driven by transactions including tech data, as well as Albertsons and other capital solutions transactions. The increase in compensation cost reflects continued investment in building out our capabilities across the areas of growth that Josh highlighted, including in infrastructure, our hybrid capital business and FRE [ph] platform, as well as in technology and various support functions across the firm. Turning to incentive realizations. We had a very low level of gross realized performance fees in the quarter, which drove negative pretax incentive earnings for the quarter after accounting for the profit share interests in realized carry and financing costs associated with our debt and preferred securities. As a result, our dividend of $0.49 per share for the quarter was fully supported by our after-tax FRE. On AUM, as Leon and Josh both referenced, we saw growth of $98 billion in AUM, as a result of the strategic growth at Athene and Athora, as well as strong fundraising, organic growth at Athene and positive mark-to-market adjustments. For the second quarter, fee generating AUM grew by 36% or $88 billion to $330 billion, supported by those same factors, as well as robust capital deployment. Gross redemptions in the first half of the year were just $1.2 billion or well less than 1% of our AUM through a period of significant volatility, reflecting the largely long-dated nature of our funds capital. Moving on to investment performance during the second quarter. Our private equity funds portfolio appreciated by 12%, primarily due to strong performance across our fund\u2019s public holdings. The portfolio remains in good shape overall, despite the challenging economic environment. Fund VIII is now out of holdback having appreciated by 17% during the quarter. We invested Fund VIII with an emphasis on durable business models and strong free cash flow and with the focus on purchase price. Fund VIII portfolio companies were bought at a 6.5 times enterprise value to EBITDA multiple on average, excluding cost savings with only 3.6 times of leverage on average, well below industry levels. Given our value orientation and the high quality of our fund\u2019s portfolio companies, we remain confident in our platform's ability to generate meaningful realized returns over time. We recorded impairment charges of approximately $1 billion during the second quarter, across a handful of investments that we had previously identified on our watch list. These investments were focused on energy or were heavily impacted by COVID. We are required to recruit patient payments before future performance fees may be distributed. We continue to expect that gross realized performance fees will be very modest over the course of 2020 as portfolio companies manage the impacts of COVID on their operations and as we prioritize the return of LP capital, as a consequence of the impairments. In credit, our fund\u2019s aggregate portfolio appreciated by 7.4% during the quarter supported by the rebound in public credit markets. On a year-to-date basis, our credit fund\u2019s portfolio in aggregate is down 2.5%, outperforming both the S&P Leveraged Loan Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Index by roughly 2%. Our credit strategies fund is also up by 68% year-to-date. In real assets, our overall return for the quarter was positive 1.4%. Energy continued to have a de minimis impact on our portfolio performance in both, private equity and credit this quarter. Our net economic balance sheet value at the end of the second quarter after debt, preferred equity financing obligations was approximately $2 per share, growing meaningfully from the prior quarter. Our net performance fee receivable increased by approximately $0.40 per share, reflecting in part the full reversal of holdback in Fund VIII. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.75 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. In June, we raised $500 million through a debt offering to further bolster our capital position in light of accommodating in attractively priced markets. Our dry powder for investments across our fund complex was $47 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $6 billion driven by fundraising during the quarter. And with that, we'll now turn the call back to the operator and open the line for any of your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And Josh Harris has returned to the conference. Our first question will come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So first, maybe just to touch on Marc's decision to step away from the business on a sabbatical, Leon, I guess, as you described. Is this a bigger picture succession plan effort, or is this more of a temporary change and Marc will be looking to reengage? And are there any implications on the pace of deal making within insurance space we should anticipate on the back of that?\nLeon Black: I think it's really that we've been in COVID lockdown now for five months. Marc has just quarter back, two transactions in the quarter, the second quarter, which we've talked to you a bunch about, which you're aware of. And you want to take a little time off from day-to-day operations, especially with the confidence that there is a team there now of over 100 who are totally focused on insurance, and Scott Kleinman been on the Board of Athene and he\u2019s been very involved more increasingly on day-to-day. And as we've mentioned, and the reason we call it a semi sabbatical is Marc is still very, very engaged in the firm and on the strategic planning with Josh and myself. He remains on the Executive Committee; he remains on the Apollo Board as well as the Athene Board and Executive Committee and on Athora. So, I would really just take it at face of what we've said and not read more into it. I think, he has a well-deserved desire to not be involved in so much day-to-day, given the great team that's been built up and how much that's already been accomplished. But, I think he would tell you that he thinks we're still in early innings in terms of what he has really masterminded over the last 12 years in building the insurance operations to over $200 billion and I think believes that there's no reason that can't double over the next three, four years, and I think he plans to be a major part of that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone and congratulations on completing two very sizable transactions this quarter. Just on the two transactions, as we look forward, can you remind us on the level of deal capacity at both Athene in the U.S. and Athora Europe? And also, can you update us on the current M&A and reinsurance backdrop in both markets as we try to estimate the potential for future transactions?\nLeon Black: Gary, do you want to take that?\nGary Parr: Yes, I'd be happy to. And, I need to address the second one first. And that is just the activity level that could be available. There's several ways to look at it. One is the market opportunity, and the second is how Apollo is positioned to address the issue. The market opportunity today is as robust as it has been over the last four years. The low interest rates continue to put a lot of pressure on traditional companies. Notably, the tight spreads on public securities make it very difficult in the spread business for other companies. We of course, invest so much in originating good investments and creating extra spread. The others, their capital rules continue to create pressure. Particularly in Europe Solvency II is problematic for some back books, the old books of companies. And lastly, a lot of companies continue try to focus more on lines where they can win business or just be winners. And that means they're exiting lines of business or entire geographies, and we're seeing that level of flow. So, I'd say, sitting today, comparing to any point in time in last four years, we are in is many substantive conversations, we have no idea exactly what the timing of transactions will be. But, as an overall backdrop, it's everybody as attractive today, is it spending at any point in time in the last four years? And in that four years, we've announced five material transactions, three in the U.S., two in Europe. You asked about the capacity. We said that -- as we said, it\u2019s over $85 billion of buying power. And that basically relates to the excess capital at Athene, plus borrowing capacity. ADIP of course still has quite a lot of capacity and Athora also has about a 0.5 billion of capacity of equity. And I think the last point on this growth potential, that's our existing capacity to do transactions, so over 85 billion. But, as a reminder, as we said in Investor Day, we're very appreciative our investors believe in us. We've raised over $12 billion in the last three and a half years of equity capital to do transactions. And we continue to see that as our ability to raise capital. When we see opportunities, we think we have the credibility, at least up to this point and we've proven it and we think we will continue to.\nLeon Black: Just to add to that, it's very simply a low interest rate environment, but much of the industry is going to be challenged and will revert to shedding assets. We not only have the reference capital to do sizeable transactions, but we've also shown with both VOYA and with the recent Jackson, that we can do highly complex deals that provide holistic solutions to sellers. So, I think one, it\u2019s in our favor that there should be real supply as long as there are going to be low interest rates, which I think we all agree and certainly in the near to medium term outlook; and two, that there's really nobody out there that has both, the combination of capital and ability to deal with complexity and come up with holistic solutions and the 100 to 150 people that we have incredible depth of management in this specific area. So, I think, this all augers very positively for us in the years to come.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. And Marc, best of luck in your short stay over. Question for maybe Martin just on the $1 billion. I wonder if you could just maybe fill that back a little bit and help us understand, which portfolios are affected by that. And then, just relatively, and I apologize for igniting this question. In your supplements you mentioned that only 18 of the $47 billion of dry powder has a potential or management fees. I wondered if you could just expand on that a little bit. Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. Sure, Bill. So, the $1 billion is specific to Fund VIII and it's also contained to the -- we provided a statistic last call, last quarter that approximately 5% of Fund VIII was on a watch list. These impairments relate exclusively to that. And it also includes an impairment that we referenced two quarters ago on our Q4 call. So, combined, the impact of all the impairments or a delay in carry distributions of about $0.25 a share. And as I said in my comments, it's partly energy, and it's partly one or two other names that have just been severely affected by the pandemic. And then, as far as your second question, when we raise capital, we either -- manage fees as it's committed, which is typical for most drawdown funds, including Fund VIII, Fund IX, or we earn management fees as we deploy the capital. And so, the $18 billion that you reference is capital that\u2019s been committed to us but the one that management fees until it\u2019s invested and that's more specific to the credit business. The remainder of the dry powder has been committed and is earning management fees and is typically in drawdown funds, fund line being the most prominent example of it.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. One quickie follow-up after all your comments on fee and insurances. Just curious, in your view, rates have been low for a while, spreads have been tight for a while. What is it that gets insurance company to pull the trigger? I know there's a lot of conversations out there. And then, how important are your proprietary origination platforms for them to choose Apollo over the others in the space?\nLeon Black: Well, ultimately they're -- I think, ultimately, it's idiosyncratic in each insurance company, transaction is highly customized. And so, there's not really a one size fits all answer to that, relative to kind of what -- the factors that have been laid out previously or what's sort of driving, the insurance company decision. I think, our ability to invest the -- our ability, both to create this customized bespoke deal situations and transactions that are highly engineered as well as our asset management capability, our ability to earn extra yield, I mean, we continue to earn -- and we continue to target and earn 50 basis points extra, and that extra juice on the asset management side also provides unique secret sauce that allows us to advise. So, it\u2019s both, our ability to originate very idiosyncratic deals and it's the asset management capability that we have.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. First, I'm pretty impressed. You guys know each other so well that Martin can finish Josh's sentences and presentations without even pausing.\nJosh Harris: Technology doesn't always work. I apologize.\nKen Worthington: So, maybe just on the outlook for the pace of deployment. First, maybe what kind of economic recovery do you see? Are we in a U or an L or maybe pick the letter that best describes what you think. And then, on the last call, you guys described three phases of deployment with bespoke capital solutions being sort of in the second phase. Do you see it being sort of early days or later days with regard to bespoke solution opportunities? And ultimately, do you see the -- or what do you see as the outlook for deployment as we look forward relative to 2Q levels? Is it going to pick up, does it slow down or does it generally stay the same?\nLeon Black: Well, let's the break the business into private equity and opportunistic and credit. I think, on an overall basis, the economy is behind -- the fundamentals of the economy are behind the technicals of the economy. The big run up in the market is driven by a very significant fiscal and monetary stimulus. And the S&P 500 earnings outlook continues to be surprisingly that \u201821 earnings are going to be ahead of \u201819 earnings. Like, we don't -- when we look at the underlying economy and try to compare that to the forecast of the S&P earnings, like, we don't see it. And therefore, we think there's just going to be volatility as the market absorbs earnings that are coming in a little softer than maybe they would have expected as well as obviously you have significant volatility around COVID, around the political environment here in the U.S. and so, and then the U.S.-China relationship. Those four factors are going to lead to just volatility. And so, we expect that we're going to have opportunities across our platform. As it relates to discreet pipeline, private equity pipeline is actually picking up. And so, even though the markets are -- look to be priced at a premium, when you bifurcate the markets, the bottom 25% of the S&P trades as 10, the top 25% trades above 30. And so, there continues to be value-oriented opportunities and sweet spot. And so, private equity, for the first time, we are looking at -- other than Tech Data, which we announced, most of what we've done -- all of what we've done has been in debt in our private equity businesses. And I think, we're seeing that change a bit as our pipeline is building and more traditional private equity. On the credit side, we're seeing a very robust flow of opportunities in terms of both, bespoke capital solutions that you mentioned where companies are uniquely impacted by COVID and need capital, either to overcome leverage issues or to grow as well -- both in the investment grade space and in the non-investment grade space. And so, private capital, the public markets continue to be hospitable for some of the larger companies. But, in many cases the sort of private capital sector that we operate in and is continuing to step in and be able to do transactions. And so, we see our pipeline across everything really being very robust.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Quick follow-up on Bill's question, just to make sure we've got the understanding right. So, the $0.25 needed to still I guess the netting holding, that would just be realized cash carry, $0.25 of really cash carry than anything beyond that would flow through DE?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. That's right, Patrick. It's a timing in fact. So, the next set of realizations that are required to fill or cover that impairment are devoted exclusively to the LPs and thereafter it would then flow back into DE and the distribution. And so, everything else being unchanged, it pays down LP capital more quickly and then creates more carry after that to the fund.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, maybe sticking with the insurance theme, just curious with Athora specifically. So, what is the opportunity there for redeployment of VIVAT assets? If I think historically, Leon has represented this way with Athene on a new block business and [indiscernible] roughly about 20% of the investments were made their way to various Apollo managed funds and what not. Is the same opportunity there for Athora, over given the different regulatory rules there, not as much potential to shift the portfolio around?\nLeon Black: Gary, why don\u2019t you take this one?\nGary Parr: I can do a part of it and then hand off to Martin. A few things. As you know, our arrangement with Athora is that we have a standard fee, our base fee, where we provide a variety of services to Athora and all the parts of Athora authority for asset liability management, risk management, mergers and acquisitions and so on. So, that base fee is in place. As it relates to the rest of Athora and the various parts of Athora, we sub-advise on various asset classes where we have expertise. And a big headline, of course, is that in Europe, roughly 50% of an insurer\u2019s balance sheet is going to be sovereign\u2019s, government\u2019s. And that's just a part of managing asset liability and Solvency II. So that's not something that we do or apply. So, by definition, there's a smaller pool of the total of assets, but that's exactly then what we can provide our expertise. And over time, assets -- in those segments of expertise we have, touch wood, VIVAT will be and Athora generally, will be looking to us to provide. Maybe Martin, I know you, as to how we communicated certain numbers...\nMartin Kelly: Yes. I mean, next 12 to 24 months, we would expect that the -- to be redeploying Athora\u2019s assets into higher yielding assets and Apollo will be sub-advising more of those assets. We haven't really set specifically or put a target our there specifically, but what we've ultimately said is that the economics, there are lots of nuances and differences between Athene and Athora. And what we've ultimately said is that the economics on the AUM of Athora to Apollo should be similar to Athene. And we\u2019ve left ourselves 24 months or so to get there.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Good morning. Just a question here on the outlook for realizations, and appreciating the capital markets have reopened, I think, which has been a positive. But really trying to get a sense of whether you feel like there's going to be an ability to sell assets through M&A. I guess, I'm curious if virtual processes are starting, an ability to do that. And whether there's any kind of efficiencies that are being learned today that may last beyond the pandemic? Obviously, everyone's using technology quite a bit more. So, I'm curious, kind of how that connects as well. And then, just anything more you can say about kind of the realization outlook would be appreciated.\nLeon Black: Yes. I mean, the realization outlook is just difficult to predict. And I think that we hesitate, given all the volatility to predict, how that's going to go right now. I would say that it's more difficult. But, things are changing on a daily basis. And, I do -- I think that certainly in terms of transactions, people are getting used to doing diligence by Zoom, virtual data rooms, virtual management meetings. I actually experienced one myself. And then, ultimately, the face to face interaction that you need when you're partnering with the team, that gets more limited, but it has to be done carefully. So, the M&A markets, we'll work around the pandemic. But, I think that it's not -- I would say it's not -- it's certainly -- it makes it a little bit more cumbersome, but it's manageable. So, I think we continue to focus on -- so, we\u2019ll hesitate from predicting realizations. I think that we continue to look for opportunities and we do have some public companies that are enabled to kind of take advantage of the public markets. But by and large, we're focused right now on growing and continue to deliver very significant and durable FRE, and high margins, and continue to grow FRE stream, which is much more predictable. And I think, when you think of cycle, our realizations would be there. We're building value on our portfolio.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking my question this morning, perhaps one on the strategic origination business. And if you could maybe add a little context or color on the opportunity set, what Apollo\u2019s competitive advantage is there and perhaps even how you see that platform scaling going forward? Thank you.\nLeon Black: Yes. So, our Company\u2019s advantage has been, obviously we have the largest alternative credit business in the world. And, we have hundreds of investors and originators and originators, and we have a really significant capital base. And so, what that allows us to do is commit $1 billion to upto $2 billion of capital to sort of larger companies, in the $1 billion to $5 billion TV that need capital solutions very quickly, very bespoke way. And I think that we -- because of our -- the size of our platform and the size of our capital base really puts us in a very unique position in today's markets where the need for capital is quite large. And so, I don't think, there's very many people that can -- that have those advantages. And so, we're in a very small group. And so, it's going to be a really interesting capability that not a lot of other people have.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.\nChris Harris: Great. Can you guys maybe give us an update on trends you're seeing in your underlying portfolio? I know, in the past, I think you talked about 5% of the portfolio on watch. Has that changed at all since last quarter?\nLeon Black: Yes. At this point, it\u2019s about 3%. And I think that right now, we've -- obviously, as we mentioned in the last call, we definitely took a hit in energy. And then, we've had one or two other situations that have been -- are in COVID affected industries, certainly restaurants being front and centre. And those have all been marked down and therefore -- or marked to zero. And that's part of what Martin is talking about, or pretty much all of what Martin's talking about on the $0.26. So, going forward, we don't see a lot of issues. I mean, obviously -- and works and sort of -- so we expect the portfolio to improve from here, subject to -- and head in a very positive direction, subject to obviously, kind of an economic downturn that goes the other way, which we don't really forecast right now. So, we think kind of a lot of our issues are behind us, and we're going to build value from here.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the strategic origination platform. I was just hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on your aspirations there longer term, and maybe talk about how you're approaching planning to originate in this larger part of the marketplace. Maybe what are you building out in terms of headcount? And I know a lot of the private credit space has been more sponsor financed. It sounds like this is maybe a little bit less so. Maybe just talk a little bit about the hurdles in terms of moving beyond sponsor finance? How you're approaching that?\nLeon Black: Yes. I mean, I think, like basically we're building out -- we have a significant origination at midcap that's in the lower middle market. And then, we're making significant hires in the middle and upper market. And this all relates to the sort of withdraw or sort of the pullback of the banks from being willing to make significant underwriting and capital commitment. And we set up a situation where we have both client balance sheets that are able to hold as well as a vehicle that allows us to underwrite and then sell. And so, we're building up kind of a whole team, to do that. And we've already made a series of hires and expect that team to be in excess of 20 to just be out calling on companies and on sponsors. It's really that simple. And then, we're building up a capital markets effort. We're adding to our broker dealer and our capital markets effort to be able to kind of syndicate a little bit where we're committing to a little more than we ultimately want to own for our clients. And so, the ability to underwrite and sort of quickly underwrite up to $2 billion loan is something that is going to be unique or amongst a very small group of people. And so, we expect that to be highly needed in the marketplace. And so, we're hiring on both fronts, capital markets and origination. And ultimately, we expect there to be a lot of action there. And, I mean, it's no different. I mean, you literally are just calling on companies and calling on sponsors and it's a lot of the same skill sets. We have -- and across our platform because we're integrated, we have hundreds of professionals in private equity and credit that are -- now have just greater tools in their toolkits. So, because of the integration across our firm, private equity credit, real estate, this just -- we now have a lot more capability, private equity, a team member that might be calling on a company now knows, well, maybe you don't want to go private, maybe you don't want to sell your company, but we've got this other opportunity to offer you. And so, increasingly, under the leadership of Scott and Jim, we're seeing the whole firm, all 500 of our investment professionals, taking part in this. And so, we are building up unique people to do this, but it's across our platform. And our integrated platform is very different than how other people run their businesses.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.\nJeremy Campbell: Just maybe one on the insurance landscape. Obviously, given all your peers have jumped into the market relatively recently, over the past year or so, and your relationship with Athene, the capital [indiscernible] a little bit differentiated. Just kind of wondering, does this competitive market kind of relegate you and the partners to more kind of big game hunting here in insurance world as maybe the smaller deals get a little bit aggressively bid, given the competition? And then, if so, maybe just from the insurance executive side, what are some of the hurdles that you guys see to these executives doing a big deal like that?\nLeon Black: So, it's big deals and it's also like our ability to navigate complexity and structure, bespoke solutions to tackle, big insurance portfolios that might not be discreetly fixed annuity or discreetly variable annuity. And so, it's broad set of -- our broad set of capabilities, and then, it's our asset management capability. So it's all three of those things that make us unique. But, Gary, do you want to add to that.\nGary Parr: Just briefly to say that we view our breadth of expertise and our size as indeed one of our big competitive advantage. We have six segments of expertise, U.S. spread business, European spread, variable capability, life settlements and structure settlements as in fund FCI and we have property casualty runoff and then P&C flow. With all those skills, we can then go to larger companies and talk about solutions. So, your question somewhat relates to, I think Glenn asked it earlier about comparative advantages in these transactions? Are there common themes? And if you take the three U.S. transactions, [indiscernible] Jackson, a common theme was that these companies were looking for a solution to something. They actually weren't selling something per se, their business wasn't for sale, per se, but they were trying to solve for different strategic directions. And that's where we go in with our expertise and capital, and we work with them. So, the CEO dialogue actually, if you would enjoy being in the room to hear the dialogue, because the CEO is talking about what they're trying to accomplish in their company, Prudential being the most recent in our conversations with Mike Wells, which were delightful and productive, but us trying to figure out win-win-win solutions. And by that we mean that -- in that instance Prudential, Athene, and Apollo stocks all outperformed their respective peers on the announcement of a transaction. The same happened in Voya, one of you all actually wrote about that. So, that's what prompts a CEO to want to engage is -- and now we actually have a track record. So, relative to our competition, we've now established this singular track record of creating value for multiple parties involved in a transaction. That's a competitive advantage that we will continue to in these substantive conversations we're having today. That's the kind of conversation we have.\nLeon Black: We have more permanent capital than anyone other than Berkshire Hathaway. And the truth of the matter is, we're so deep and so well-known in the insurance space, and our regulatory relationships are positive that all of these things create a franchise for us that is unparalleled. And, we're tracking -- the ability to track talent is probably positively impacted by that.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. Thanks. Josh, you were talking about the disconnect between the real economy and the market. I was just looking at the statistics which has the leveraged loans, default rates at around 3.9% in the almost all in energy resources at retail. If you had to guess six to nine months from now, where would that be? And, what is both the risk to existing investments and the opportunities to deploy against that?\nJosh Harris: Yes. So, I mean, obviously the answer to that's going to depend on ultimately the liquidity that's provided by the Federal Reserve that's indicated that it's all in and the economy, the recovery of the economy. I think, we expect that it'll go up from here. And I think that that well kind of open up a series of opportunities for us. And so, do we get to double digit? We could, for a year, for some period of time. I think that that will open distinctive opportunities for us. As to kind of like our portfolio, we're pretty much all first lien and top of the capital structure. We've been very oriented towards the safest, most high quality secure debt across our platform. And that did not serve us well as well in a risk on environment. But, it serves as a very well in an environment like the one you're describing. And so, we expect that our portfolio would be quite robust in that scenario and that our opportunities, I think, it would open up a lot. And so, certainly we're not -- for the world, obviously, we're not -- we hope that we're wrong and that the economy does as well as the stock market thinks it'll do. But, we're not planning for that in terms of how we invest. And so, therefore, we think we would be pretty robust in that situation. I think, capital would also find us.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with UBS. \nAdam Beatty: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on the existing portfolio companies, more so from the deployment angle. How much of the -- I wanted to get a sense of how much of the deployment so far this year has been with companies that you already owned and kind of the outlook on that. And also, if you could, the mix within that deployment of kind of offense versus defense, depending on the specific company circumstances? Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So, that's a zero or negligible. So very little, I mean, there may have been something that went into the existing portfolio. So, I want to say very little has gone into the existing portfolio and nearly a 100% has been on offense. So, when we talk about the 3%, we're not -- we haven't had to deploy into existing situations across the company.\nOperator: With that, I will now hand the conference back over to Gary Stein for closing remarks. \nGary Stein: Great. Thanks operator. Thanks everyone for joining us. If you have any questions, please feel free to follow up with us, and the team looks forward to catching up with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Josh Harris",
            "content": "Thanks, Leon. We are really pleased to further evolve our leadership team, and I look forward to continuing to drive growth for Apollo alongside you and Marc. Apollo has responded, as Leon mentioned, to the challenges of working through the global pandemic, exceptionally well. Our outmost priority during this time has been to focus on the health and safety of our people and their families, which include our 15 offices around the world. We have challenged ourselves to innovate and adapt to new technology and to make this work -- a remote work environment, as efficient as possible. Looking forward, we are approaching the return to office with an emphasis on ensuring the ongoing wellbeing and productivity of our employees. Now, turning to our results. Our business has done exceptionally well over the last six months. For many years, we've been making four key points about how our business would perform during a period of severe market dislocation or a recession. Number one, our FRE growth and margins would be durable and stable; two, our fundraising would be resilient and potentially accelerate, driving AUM growth; three, we would find attractive risk reward investment opportunities for our investors; and four, the majority of our markdowns in our funds portfolios would be transient. All of these are proving out during this period of time, reflecting the strength of our platform. I'd like to briefly highlight the two notable transactions that reflect our continued market leadership in serving our insurance clients. These transactions closed during the second quarter, despite a backdrop of continued market volatility and uncertainty. At the beginning of the second quarter, Athora closed on its acquisition of VIVAT. Athora\u2019s assets now stand at $60 billion. This transaction is transformative for Athora, as it creates a meaningful scale, diversifies Athora\u2019s business further geographically, and adds significant operational talent and a distribution capability to the Athora platform in the Netherlands. In addition, in June, Athene announced and closed its reinsurance transaction with Jackson National, which is the largest reinsurance transaction in recent history. Through these transactions, Athene and Athora have added $73 billion of assets. And we believe that substantial consolidation opportunities remain across the insurance industry. Following these two transactions, our insurance clients continue to have a strong capital position with over $85 billion of buying power in aggregate. This capital serves as a key strategic differentiator for our clients as they do unique asset management, transaction and origination capabilities of more than 150 employees at Apollo focused on serving them. Apollo\u2019s permanent capital vehicles now represent 60% or approximately $250 billion of our AUM. And over 90% of our AUM is either derived from permanent capital vehicles or has a contractual life of five years or more from inception. The stable base of AUM continues to underpin our durable and growing fee-related earnings, which we have successfully grown through all market environments and expect to continue to do so. For the first half of 2020, our FRE grew at 9% compared to the first half of 2019. Despite multiple periods of market dislocation and the impact of an ongoing global health and economic crisis, we continue to remain highly committed to growing FRE at a robust pace over the long run and remain very confident in our ability to achieve the goals we set for our long-term FRE growth at our Investor Day last November. Our FRE margin was 55% for the first half of 2020, in line with our 2019 FRE margin. Turning to fundraising. Total inflows during the second quarter were a robust $89 billion, inclusive of Athene and Athora growth. Over the last 12 months, total inflows have been $119 billion, a record for Apollo. This includes $73 billion of growth of insurance clients, mergers and acquisitions, $35 billion of capital raising and other inflows from our fund investors, and $11 billion from organic growth at our insurance clients. In the second quarter, the breadth of our platform\u2019s investment capabilities and strength of our global relationships with investors drove fundraising that was significantly above our average quarterly level. Notably, this momentum was achieved during a time of nearly all virtual interactions. During the quarter we announced and closed on $17.4 billion in fund commitments. Key initiatives include the launch of Apollo Strategic Origination Partners platform, which will target an emerging opportunity in the large scale direct origination solutions for high quality businesses, a market currently underserved by private credit. The origination partnership will leverage Apollo's incumbency with borrowers, utilizing our credit platforms relationships with approximately 3,300 issuers of both, corporate and sponsor-backed companies. Also contributing to inflows was a $1.75 billion close for our Accord III B. This is our dislocation strategy that we were able to launch and close within approximately eight weeks. And we are now in the market for the next series of the Accord strategies. Looking forward, we remain confident that we will be able to meet or exceed the $20 billion fundraising goal we discussed on our last earnings call, which consisted of increasing the target size for certain funds, accelerating the timeline for other fundraisers, launching new strategies to address opportunities driven by market dislocation. We are appreciative of the trust and support from both, existing and new investors as they commit to a range of strategies currently available on our platform, including our origination strategy, Accord, Hybrid Value, infrastructure, U.S. and Asia real estate, managed accounts and various evergreen strategies. During the second quarter, turning to deployment, we deployed $7.2 billion of capital across our drawdown fund. Through a shifting market landscape, we remain active looking for attractive asymmetric risk reward and investing in high-quality top of the capital structure opportunities. As public markets have recovered, driven by massive but unnecessary federal stimulus, instead of fundamentals, it's been more challenging to find these attractive risk reward opportunities. However, we have been able to successfully navigate these markets to date and are increasingly focused on providing bespoke capital solutions for brand name franchises, facing liquidity constraints or looking to capitalize on growth opportunities. Capital deployments for the quarter included originations led by our Hybrid Value and credit businesses for companies such as Expedia, Albertsons, Airbnb, MFA, Cimpress, NGL Energy and Delta. As of the second quarter Hybrid Value stood at 71% committed or invested. And we were back in the market for this strategy. These transactions highlight the benefits of our globally integrated platform and the deep pools of capital across our clients, which allow us to structure bespoke financing solutions quickly and with certainty of execution. Going forward, we believe these factors will continue to make Apollo a premier financing partner for companies, and we see a strong pipeline ahead for hybrid value, our various credit vehicles and our new strategic origination partnership. In addition, our private equity fund, Fund IX, recently closed on the $6 billion take-private transaction for Tech Data, representing the largest public to private transaction completed this year. Tech Data is a global leader in information technology distribution, which we believe is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the secular IT spending tailwinds. And we created this investment in an attractive creation multiple of approximately 7 times EBITDA prior to cost savings. As of the end of the second quarter, Fund IX has reached 40% committed or invested. Looking ahead, we remain of the view that technicals are well ahead of fundamentals, and therefore we are prepared for continued volatility and a wide range of outcomes over the coming quarters. Apollo\u2019s leading investment returns through cycles are reflective of both, our focus on preserving capital for our investors and our ability to pivot quickly and opportunistically to invest during leading market dislocations. Our private equity and credit pipelines are robust, and we believe there will be many opportunities for us to identify and capture misplaced risk on behalf of our investors in the months and quarters to come. Finally, as we have discussed in recent quarters, we remain focused on increasing the accessibility and liquidity profile of our stock. As a result of the changes made to date, we are now included in the CRISP, S&P Total Market, MSCI and Russell indices. To our existing shareholders, we are grateful that you have been along for the ride; and to our prospective new shareholders, we look forward to engaging with you. To conclude my comments, our strong results for the second quarter and first half of this year are a testament to the strength of Apollo's global integrated platform and resiliency of our team. Against a very challenging market backdrop, we have demonstrated the durability of our growing FRE and the stability of our margins. Through severe market dislocations, our funds invested meaningfully during a short window of very-attractive risk reward opportunities, creating what we believe will be a substantial value for our investors. We also demonstrated our ability to pivot quickly in reaction to shifting market landscapes and are now increasingly focused on providing capital solutions for franchise businesses. And we see a growing pipeline of private equity. We've grown our AUM at a substantial pace over last year and continue to see strong demand for our products, putting us on pace to achieve or exceed communicated goals of raising over $20 billion of new capital over the next year and being well on our way to surpassing $600 billion of AUM [Technical difficulty] Technology doesn't always work. I apologize. Yes. So, I mean, obviously the answer to that's going to depend on ultimately the liquidity that's provided by the Federal Reserve that's indicated that it's all in and the economy, the recovery of the economy. I think, we expect that it'll go up from here. And I think that that well kind of open up a series of opportunities for us. And so, do we get to double digit? We could, for a year, for some period of time. I think that that will open distinctive opportunities for us. As to kind of like our portfolio, we're pretty much all first lien and top of the capital structure. We've been very oriented towards the safest, most high quality secure debt across our platform. And that did not serve us well as well in a risk on environment. But, it serves as a very well in an environment like the one you're describing. And so, we expect that our portfolio would be quite robust in that scenario and that our opportunities, I think, it would open up a lot. And so, certainly we're not -- for the world, obviously, we're not -- we hope that we're wrong and that the economy does as well as the stock market thinks it'll do. But, we're not planning for that in terms of how we invest. And so, therefore, we think we would be pretty robust in that situation. I think, capital would also find us."

            "name": "Leon Black",
            "content": "Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to express my wishes to everyone listening that this finds you and your families healthy and safe. And to our employees who have continued to work tirelessly on behalf of our clients and our shareholders, I'd like to convey my appreciation and gratitude. We are not working under typical circumstances, to say the least. And you have all continued to go above and beyond to drive the strong results that we're reporting today. I think, this speaks to the tenacity and spirit of our employees, as well as the collaborative and adventive culture we have at Apollo. Globally, companies continue to operate in incredibly challenging circumstances as we face what started as a health crisis, but it progressed into an economic crisis as well. Across the firm, we have responded quickly to this changing landscape with a focus on engagement and operations across our investment professionals, client and product solutions teams, and enterprise solutions group, which has helped us transition into a work-from-home environment smoothly. This quarter marked the achievement of a significant milestone as the Apollo\u2019s AUM grew by approximately $100 billion to surpass $400 billion for the first time in our history. This growth was driven by Athene, Athora and strong inflows during the quarter and represents 33% growth year-over-year. With $414 billion of AUM as of June 30th, we are well on our way towards the $600 billion goal that we provided at Investor Day this past November. We continue to see robust demand for Apollo products and a strong pipeline for insurance transactions over the next few years. As a further indication of the breadth of our platform and our activity level through the pandemic, gross purchases were $45 billion across the platform in the second quarter, with some of this related to the repositioning of insurance company balance sheets. We continue to dynamically navigate through this challenging environment on behalf of all our investors. Now, I would like to spend some time talking about the remarkable depth of leadership that resides at Apollo and continues to evolve. Since our founding, we have intensely focused on the strategic growth and evolution of Apollo as a leading world-class alternative investment manager. In recent years, we\u2019ve broadened the firm's executive team, most notably by naming Scott Kleinman and Jim Zelter, as co-presidents. Scott and Jim have shown strong corporate leadership, taking on responsibility for Apollo's revenue generating and investment businesses. Additionally, we continue to elevate and hire exemplary individuals to run the day-to-day operations across all lines of our business, including credit, private equity and real assets, and our insurance platforms. Our recent hires and the evolution of our leadership structure demonstrate our commitment towards growth, progression and the ongoing modernization of our firm. Today, we are announcing that on the back of an almost unprecedented quarter, adding $80 billion of insurance assets and liabilities to the portfolios that we manage, Marc Rowan, co-founder, who oversees this area, has decided, he will take a step back from his day-to-day oversight of the business and enjoy a semi sabbatical. Marc will continue to work with Josh and I, driving the strategic direction of the firm, especially for our financial institutions and insurance-related businesses. Marc will remain a member of the Apollo Board and Executive Committee, will continue to serve on the Board and Executive Committee of Athene and will remain on the Board of Athora. Scott Kleinman will assume the day-to-day operational responsibility of leading our financial institutions and insurance activities. Jim Zelter will continue to focus on asset management and credit investment activities across our insurance clients. Together, with Gary Parr, Gernot Lohr, Matt Michelini and Jasjit Singh, they will lead a broad team of over a 100 professionals who are dedicated to our insurance clients. Josh, Marc and I maintain the utmost confidence in this team to lead us into the next phase of growth and development for these platforms and for the firm more broadly. We are excited for what the future holds. We are also actively engaging on the topics of citizenship, diversity and inclusion. We recently completed our latest annual social responsibility report, which highlights that since the inception of our ESG program in 2008, the combined efforts are resulted in more than 10 million tons of waste recycled by portfolio companies, over 1 million volunteer hours by employees of portfolio companies, and approximately $1 billion of charitable donations just to name a few achievements. We have brought on some exceptional talent to assist with our citizenship efforts, including Lauren Coape-Arnold, who joined late last year as Global Head of Citizenship. This year, we introduced a formal charitable matching program for employees, which included special initiatives for COVID with $50 million in relief effort contributions globally from Apollo, its founders and portfolio companies, and also for racial injustice reform. These initiatives were well-supported by our employee base. More recently, as tragic events have further brought the issue of systemic racial injustice in this country to the forefront, we've been spending a great deal of time listening and thinking about how we can engage to a greater degree on this issue. As leaders in the industry, we need to be honest in acknowledging that we do more to help combat these inequities. And we are committed to enhancing our diversity and inclusion strategy in all aspects of our business. We are very excited to welcome our new Head of Leadership Development and Diversity, Jonathan Simon, who joins us next month. In addition, we have expanded our existing partnerships with organizations that work with students of color and communities in need. Finally, before turning this over to Josh who will speak more extensively on the subject, you should know that I am particularly proud of the strong performance delivered by the Apollo team in the second quarter. During challenging times, Apollo has generated dramatic growth in both, AUM and FRE, in fundraising and in deployments, as well as raising the bar on social consciousness. This has truly been a prime example of grace under pressure or of the whole Apollo enterprise getting going when the going was getting to get tougher. With that, I'd like to turn this over now to Josh to provide an overview of our business operations for the first quarter. Josh? I think it's really that we've been in COVID lockdown now for five months. Marc has just quarter back, two transactions in the quarter, the second quarter, which we've talked to you a bunch about, which you're aware of. And you want to take a little time off from day-to-day operations, especially with the confidence that there is a team there now of over 100 who are totally focused on insurance, and Scott Kleinman been on the Board of Athene and he\u2019s been very involved more increasingly on day-to-day. And as we've mentioned, and the reason we call it a semi sabbatical is Marc is still very, very engaged in the firm and on the strategic planning with Josh and myself. He remains on the Executive Committee; he remains on the Apollo Board as well as the Athene Board and Executive Committee and on Athora. So, I would really just take it at face of what we've said and not read more into it. I think, he has a well-deserved desire to not be involved in so much day-to-day, given the great team that's been built up and how much that's already been accomplished. But, I think he would tell you that he thinks we're still in early innings in terms of what he has really masterminded over the last 12 years in building the insurance operations to over $200 billion and I think believes that there's no reason that can't double over the next three, four years, and I think he plans to be a major part of that. Gary, do you want to take that? Just to add to that, it's very simply a low interest rate environment, but much of the industry is going to be challenged and will revert to shedding assets. We not only have the reference capital to do sizeable transactions, but we've also shown with both VOYA and with the recent Jackson, that we can do highly complex deals that provide holistic solutions to sellers. So, I think one, it\u2019s in our favor that there should be real supply as long as there are going to be low interest rates, which I think we all agree and certainly in the near to medium term outlook; and two, that there's really nobody out there that has both, the combination of capital and ability to deal with complexity and come up with holistic solutions and the 100 to 150 people that we have incredible depth of management in this specific area. So, I think, this all augers very positively for us in the years to come. Well, ultimately they're -- I think, ultimately, it's idiosyncratic in each insurance company, transaction is highly customized. And so, there's not really a one size fits all answer to that, relative to kind of what -- the factors that have been laid out previously or what's sort of driving, the insurance company decision. I think, our ability to invest the -- our ability, both to create this customized bespoke deal situations and transactions that are highly engineered as well as our asset management capability, our ability to earn extra yield, I mean, we continue to earn -- and we continue to target and earn 50 basis points extra, and that extra juice on the asset management side also provides unique secret sauce that allows us to advise. So, it\u2019s both, our ability to originate very idiosyncratic deals and it's the asset management capability that we have. Well, let's the break the business into private equity and opportunistic and credit. I think, on an overall basis, the economy is behind -- the fundamentals of the economy are behind the technicals of the economy. The big run up in the market is driven by a very significant fiscal and monetary stimulus. And the S&P 500 earnings outlook continues to be surprisingly that \u201821 earnings are going to be ahead of \u201819 earnings. Like, we don't -- when we look at the underlying economy and try to compare that to the forecast of the S&P earnings, like, we don't see it. And therefore, we think there's just going to be volatility as the market absorbs earnings that are coming in a little softer than maybe they would have expected as well as obviously you have significant volatility around COVID, around the political environment here in the U.S. and so, and then the U.S.-China relationship. Those four factors are going to lead to just volatility. And so, we expect that we're going to have opportunities across our platform. As it relates to discreet pipeline, private equity pipeline is actually picking up. And so, even though the markets are -- look to be priced at a premium, when you bifurcate the markets, the bottom 25% of the S&P trades as 10, the top 25% trades above 30. And so, there continues to be value-oriented opportunities and sweet spot. And so, private equity, for the first time, we are looking at -- other than Tech Data, which we announced, most of what we've done -- all of what we've done has been in debt in our private equity businesses. And I think, we're seeing that change a bit as our pipeline is building and more traditional private equity. On the credit side, we're seeing a very robust flow of opportunities in terms of both, bespoke capital solutions that you mentioned where companies are uniquely impacted by COVID and need capital, either to overcome leverage issues or to grow as well -- both in the investment grade space and in the non-investment grade space. And so, private capital, the public markets continue to be hospitable for some of the larger companies. But, in many cases the sort of private capital sector that we operate in and is continuing to step in and be able to do transactions. And so, we see our pipeline across everything really being very robust. Gary, why don\u2019t you take this one? Yes. I mean, the realization outlook is just difficult to predict. And I think that we hesitate, given all the volatility to predict, how that's going to go right now. I would say that it's more difficult. But, things are changing on a daily basis. And, I do -- I think that certainly in terms of transactions, people are getting used to doing diligence by Zoom, virtual data rooms, virtual management meetings. I actually experienced one myself. And then, ultimately, the face to face interaction that you need when you're partnering with the team, that gets more limited, but it has to be done carefully. So, the M&A markets, we'll work around the pandemic. But, I think that it's not -- I would say it's not -- it's certainly -- it makes it a little bit more cumbersome, but it's manageable. So, I think we continue to focus on -- so, we\u2019ll hesitate from predicting realizations. I think that we continue to look for opportunities and we do have some public companies that are enabled to kind of take advantage of the public markets. But by and large, we're focused right now on growing and continue to deliver very significant and durable FRE, and high margins, and continue to grow FRE stream, which is much more predictable. And I think, when you think of cycle, our realizations would be there. We're building value on our portfolio. Yes. So, our Company\u2019s advantage has been, obviously we have the largest alternative credit business in the world. And, we have hundreds of investors and originators and originators, and we have a really significant capital base. And so, what that allows us to do is commit $1 billion to upto $2 billion of capital to sort of larger companies, in the $1 billion to $5 billion TV that need capital solutions very quickly, very bespoke way. And I think that we -- because of our -- the size of our platform and the size of our capital base really puts us in a very unique position in today's markets where the need for capital is quite large. And so, I don't think, there's very many people that can -- that have those advantages. And so, we're in a very small group. And so, it's going to be a really interesting capability that not a lot of other people have. Yes. At this point, it\u2019s about 3%. And I think that right now, we've -- obviously, as we mentioned in the last call, we definitely took a hit in energy. And then, we've had one or two other situations that have been -- are in COVID affected industries, certainly restaurants being front and centre. And those have all been marked down and therefore -- or marked to zero. And that's part of what Martin is talking about, or pretty much all of what Martin's talking about on the $0.26. So, going forward, we don't see a lot of issues. I mean, obviously -- and works and sort of -- so we expect the portfolio to improve from here, subject to -- and head in a very positive direction, subject to obviously, kind of an economic downturn that goes the other way, which we don't really forecast right now. So, we think kind of a lot of our issues are behind us, and we're going to build value from here. Yes. I mean, I think, like basically we're building out -- we have a significant origination at midcap that's in the lower middle market. And then, we're making significant hires in the middle and upper market. And this all relates to the sort of withdraw or sort of the pullback of the banks from being willing to make significant underwriting and capital commitment. And we set up a situation where we have both client balance sheets that are able to hold as well as a vehicle that allows us to underwrite and then sell. And so, we're building up kind of a whole team, to do that. And we've already made a series of hires and expect that team to be in excess of 20 to just be out calling on companies and on sponsors. It's really that simple. And then, we're building up a capital markets effort. We're adding to our broker dealer and our capital markets effort to be able to kind of syndicate a little bit where we're committing to a little more than we ultimately want to own for our clients. And so, the ability to underwrite and sort of quickly underwrite up to $2 billion loan is something that is going to be unique or amongst a very small group of people. And so, we expect that to be highly needed in the marketplace. And so, we're hiring on both fronts, capital markets and origination. And ultimately, we expect there to be a lot of action there. And, I mean, it's no different. I mean, you literally are just calling on companies and calling on sponsors and it's a lot of the same skill sets. We have -- and across our platform because we're integrated, we have hundreds of professionals in private equity and credit that are -- now have just greater tools in their toolkits. So, because of the integration across our firm, private equity credit, real estate, this just -- we now have a lot more capability, private equity, a team member that might be calling on a company now knows, well, maybe you don't want to go private, maybe you don't want to sell your company, but we've got this other opportunity to offer you. And so, increasingly, under the leadership of Scott and Jim, we're seeing the whole firm, all 500 of our investment professionals, taking part in this. And so, we are building up unique people to do this, but it's across our platform. And our integrated platform is very different than how other people run their businesses. So, it's big deals and it's also like our ability to navigate complexity and structure, bespoke solutions to tackle, big insurance portfolios that might not be discreetly fixed annuity or discreetly variable annuity. And so, it's broad set of -- our broad set of capabilities, and then, it's our asset management capability. So it's all three of those things that make us unique. But, Gary, do you want to add to that. We have more permanent capital than anyone other than Berkshire Hathaway. And the truth of the matter is, we're so deep and so well-known in the insurance space, and our regulatory relationships are positive that all of these things create a franchise for us that is unparalleled. And, we're tracking -- the ability to track talent is probably positively impacted by that."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "I'll finish that -- he's at the tail end. I'll finish his comments and then go into mine. So being well underway to surpassing $600 billion of AUM over a five-year period and growing our FRE mid-teens average annual rate, as we outlined in last November's Investor Day. To help achieve these goals, we continue to invest meaningfully across the platform, building out our investment talent and infrastructure. So, it's Martin. I\u2019ll pick up on the comments. I\u2019d firstly like to echo Josh\u2019s appreciation for all our employees whose hard work has resulted in a seamless transition into our current remote working environment. So, on dividend, FRE&D. For the second quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.49 per share supported by our after tax FRE. Our reliable FRE stream supports the dividend at a level above our stated minimum of $0.40 per quarter. And in quarters of more meaningful transaction fees the dividend can be substantially higher, even without the benefit of performance fees. We generated FRE of $0.59 per share on a pretax basis for the quarter, driven by growth in management fees and some higher transaction fees. Transaction and advisory fees were $62 million in the quarter, driven by transactions including tech data, as well as Albertsons and other capital solutions transactions. The increase in compensation cost reflects continued investment in building out our capabilities across the areas of growth that Josh highlighted, including in infrastructure, our hybrid capital business and FRE [ph] platform, as well as in technology and various support functions across the firm. Turning to incentive realizations. We had a very low level of gross realized performance fees in the quarter, which drove negative pretax incentive earnings for the quarter after accounting for the profit share interests in realized carry and financing costs associated with our debt and preferred securities. As a result, our dividend of $0.49 per share for the quarter was fully supported by our after-tax FRE. On AUM, as Leon and Josh both referenced, we saw growth of $98 billion in AUM, as a result of the strategic growth at Athene and Athora, as well as strong fundraising, organic growth at Athene and positive mark-to-market adjustments. For the second quarter, fee generating AUM grew by 36% or $88 billion to $330 billion, supported by those same factors, as well as robust capital deployment. Gross redemptions in the first half of the year were just $1.2 billion or well less than 1% of our AUM through a period of significant volatility, reflecting the largely long-dated nature of our funds capital. Moving on to investment performance during the second quarter. Our private equity funds portfolio appreciated by 12%, primarily due to strong performance across our fund\u2019s public holdings. The portfolio remains in good shape overall, despite the challenging economic environment. Fund VIII is now out of holdback having appreciated by 17% during the quarter. We invested Fund VIII with an emphasis on durable business models and strong free cash flow and with the focus on purchase price. Fund VIII portfolio companies were bought at a 6.5 times enterprise value to EBITDA multiple on average, excluding cost savings with only 3.6 times of leverage on average, well below industry levels. Given our value orientation and the high quality of our fund\u2019s portfolio companies, we remain confident in our platform's ability to generate meaningful realized returns over time. We recorded impairment charges of approximately $1 billion during the second quarter, across a handful of investments that we had previously identified on our watch list. These investments were focused on energy or were heavily impacted by COVID. We are required to recruit patient payments before future performance fees may be distributed. We continue to expect that gross realized performance fees will be very modest over the course of 2020 as portfolio companies manage the impacts of COVID on their operations and as we prioritize the return of LP capital, as a consequence of the impairments. In credit, our fund\u2019s aggregate portfolio appreciated by 7.4% during the quarter supported by the rebound in public credit markets. On a year-to-date basis, our credit fund\u2019s portfolio in aggregate is down 2.5%, outperforming both the S&P Leveraged Loan Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Index by roughly 2%. Our credit strategies fund is also up by 68% year-to-date. In real assets, our overall return for the quarter was positive 1.4%. Energy continued to have a de minimis impact on our portfolio performance in both, private equity and credit this quarter. Our net economic balance sheet value at the end of the second quarter after debt, preferred equity financing obligations was approximately $2 per share, growing meaningfully from the prior quarter. Our net performance fee receivable increased by approximately $0.40 per share, reflecting in part the full reversal of holdback in Fund VIII. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.75 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. In June, we raised $500 million through a debt offering to further bolster our capital position in light of accommodating in attractively priced markets. Our dry powder for investments across our fund complex was $47 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $6 billion driven by fundraising during the quarter. And with that, we'll now turn the call back to the operator and open the line for any of your questions. Yes. Sure, Bill. So, the $1 billion is specific to Fund VIII and it's also contained to the -- we provided a statistic last call, last quarter that approximately 5% of Fund VIII was on a watch list. These impairments relate exclusively to that. And it also includes an impairment that we referenced two quarters ago on our Q4 call. So, combined, the impact of all the impairments or a delay in carry distributions of about $0.25 a share. And as I said in my comments, it's partly energy, and it's partly one or two other names that have just been severely affected by the pandemic. And then, as far as your second question, when we raise capital, we either -- manage fees as it's committed, which is typical for most drawdown funds, including Fund VIII, Fund IX, or we earn management fees as we deploy the capital. And so, the $18 billion that you reference is capital that\u2019s been committed to us but the one that management fees until it\u2019s invested and that's more specific to the credit business. The remainder of the dry powder has been committed and is earning management fees and is typically in drawdown funds, fund line being the most prominent example of it. Yes. That's right, Patrick. It's a timing in fact. So, the next set of realizations that are required to fill or cover that impairment are devoted exclusively to the LPs and thereafter it would then flow back into DE and the distribution. And so, everything else being unchanged, it pays down LP capital more quickly and then creates more carry after that to the fund. Yes. I mean, next 12 to 24 months, we would expect that the -- to be redeploying Athora\u2019s assets into higher yielding assets and Apollo will be sub-advising more of those assets. We haven't really set specifically or put a target our there specifically, but what we've ultimately said is that the economics, there are lots of nuances and differences between Athene and Athora. And what we've ultimately said is that the economics on the AUM of Athora to Apollo should be similar to Athene. And we\u2019ve left ourselves 24 months or so to get there. Yes. So, that's a zero or negligible. So very little, I mean, there may have been something that went into the existing portfolio. So, I want to say very little has gone into the existing portfolio and nearly a 100% has been on offense. So, when we talk about the 3%, we're not -- we haven't had to deploy into existing situations across the company."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Gary Parr",
            "content": "Yes, I'd be happy to. And, I need to address the second one first. And that is just the activity level that could be available. There's several ways to look at it. One is the market opportunity, and the second is how Apollo is positioned to address the issue. The market opportunity today is as robust as it has been over the last four years. The low interest rates continue to put a lot of pressure on traditional companies. Notably, the tight spreads on public securities make it very difficult in the spread business for other companies. We of course, invest so much in originating good investments and creating extra spread. The others, their capital rules continue to create pressure. Particularly in Europe Solvency II is problematic for some back books, the old books of companies. And lastly, a lot of companies continue try to focus more on lines where they can win business or just be winners. And that means they're exiting lines of business or entire geographies, and we're seeing that level of flow. So, I'd say, sitting today, comparing to any point in time in last four years, we are in is many substantive conversations, we have no idea exactly what the timing of transactions will be. But, as an overall backdrop, it's everybody as attractive today, is it spending at any point in time in the last four years? And in that four years, we've announced five material transactions, three in the U.S., two in Europe. You asked about the capacity. We said that -- as we said, it\u2019s over $85 billion of buying power. And that basically relates to the excess capital at Athene, plus borrowing capacity. ADIP of course still has quite a lot of capacity and Athora also has about a 0.5 billion of capacity of equity. And I think the last point on this growth potential, that's our existing capacity to do transactions, so over 85 billion. But, as a reminder, as we said in Investor Day, we're very appreciative our investors believe in us. We've raised over $12 billion in the last three and a half years of equity capital to do transactions. And we continue to see that as our ability to raise capital. When we see opportunities, we think we have the credibility, at least up to this point and we've proven it and we think we will continue to. I can do a part of it and then hand off to Martin. A few things. As you know, our arrangement with Athora is that we have a standard fee, our base fee, where we provide a variety of services to Athora and all the parts of Athora authority for asset liability management, risk management, mergers and acquisitions and so on. So, that base fee is in place. As it relates to the rest of Athora and the various parts of Athora, we sub-advise on various asset classes where we have expertise. And a big headline, of course, is that in Europe, roughly 50% of an insurer\u2019s balance sheet is going to be sovereign\u2019s, government\u2019s. And that's just a part of managing asset liability and Solvency II. So that's not something that we do or apply. So, by definition, there's a smaller pool of the total of assets, but that's exactly then what we can provide our expertise. And over time, assets -- in those segments of expertise we have, touch wood, VIVAT will be and Athora generally, will be looking to us to provide. Maybe Martin, I know you, as to how we communicated certain numbers... Just briefly to say that we view our breadth of expertise and our size as indeed one of our big competitive advantage. We have six segments of expertise, U.S. spread business, European spread, variable capability, life settlements and structure settlements as in fund FCI and we have property casualty runoff and then P&C flow. With all those skills, we can then go to larger companies and talk about solutions. So, your question somewhat relates to, I think Glenn asked it earlier about comparative advantages in these transactions? Are there common themes? And if you take the three U.S. transactions, [indiscernible] Jackson, a common theme was that these companies were looking for a solution to something. They actually weren't selling something per se, their business wasn't for sale, per se, but they were trying to solve for different strategic directions. And that's where we go in with our expertise and capital, and we work with them. So, the CEO dialogue actually, if you would enjoy being in the room to hear the dialogue, because the CEO is talking about what they're trying to accomplish in their company, Prudential being the most recent in our conversations with Mike Wells, which were delightful and productive, but us trying to figure out win-win-win solutions. And by that we mean that -- in that instance Prudential, Athene, and Apollo stocks all outperformed their respective peers on the announcement of a transaction. The same happened in Voya, one of you all actually wrote about that. So, that's what prompts a CEO to want to engage is -- and now we actually have a track record. So, relative to our competition, we've now established this singular track record of creating value for multiple parties involved in a transaction. That's a competitive advantage that we will continue to in these substantive conversations we're having today. That's the kind of conversation we have."

During today's presentation, all callers will be placed in a listen-only mode and following management's prepared remarks, the conference call will be open for questions. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings, including the 8-K Apollo filed this morning, for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also, note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Gary Stein, Head of Investor Relations.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks operator. Good morning and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. We hope you and your families are staying safe in these challenging times. Joining me this morning are Leon Black, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Josh Harris, Co-Founder and Senior Managing Director and Martin Kelly, Chief Financial Officer and Co-Chief Operating Officer. Our Co-President, Jim Zelter, is also on the line and will be available during the Q&A session. Earlier this morning, we reported distributable earnings of $0.37 per common share, pretax fee-related earnings of $0.52 per share and a cash dividend of $0.42 per share for the first quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Leon Black.\nLeon Black: Good morning. Thanks Gary and thank you all for joining us. I would like to focus my comments this morning on the unprecedented circumstances we are collectively facing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. What began as a virus has become a global health and economic crisis of enormous proportions and we, first and foremost, like to extend our thanks to all of the healthcare professionals and frontline workers for their extraordinary dedication through these difficult times. I would also like to thank our Apollo employees for their continued hard work and commitment to the firm over the past couple of months. The enduring strength of our business is a testament to all of their individual contributions. On behalf of the management team, we extend our appreciation. As the crisis began to unfold a couple of months ago, our first order of business was to ensure the safety, health and wellness of our employees and their families and we continue to monitor their wellbeing provide ongoing support. We then quickly turned our attention to preserving business continuity across the firm. Apollo has rapidly adjusted to working remotely further embracing technology to ensure a relatively seamless transition to work from home environment across the firm's 15 offices around the world. Additionally, over the past couple of months, we have spent a great deal of time with the portfolio companies in the various funds we manage. In early March, we created a portfolio crisis response team, which has been meeting daily and remains in constant communication with the management of our funds portfolio companies ensuring best practices are shared across areas such as healthcare, business operations and capital management. With respect to the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program or PPP, none of the companies controlled by Apollo or the funds we manage will be utilizing this program. Similarly, although we are still reviewing the guidance recently announced by the Federal Reserve, we do not anticipate that the Main Street Lending Program will provide any relief or financial assistance to companies controlled by us or our funds. We have been able to leverage the knowledge across the Apollo platform to provide advice and support to these businesses. As Josh will discuss in greater detail shortly, the investment portfolios remain in good shape due to our consistent focus on value pricing discipline, conservative underwriting and use of the less leveraged than the industry. In considering the tremendous pressure that COVID has placed on our society as we unite to fight this pandemic, we have also placed an emphasis on identifying how we can support and empower the communities around us. Between Apollo and current portfolio companies, our shared efforts amount to over $50 million in relief effort contributions globally to-date. Various portfolio companies have also stepped up to provide aid in other ways. As an example, Diamond Resorts is providing free lodging to healthcare workers and first responders while LifePoint as partnered with authorities to set up a temporary hospital and has participated in drive-by COVID testing events. McGraw-Hill Education is offering free access to online Higher Ed coursework and training professors and students to transition to digital learning platform. And Shutterfly and Amissima, among others, secured, funded and donated items such as masks, ventilators and hospital supplies. These are just a handful example out of many and I could not be more proud of our employees and those in our funds' portfolio companies who have assisted and championed these efforts. Amid these challenging circumstances, we have been able to demonstrate the resiliency of the Apollo model. Now more than ever, Apollo is well-positioned to preserve and drive exceptional value to our investors, which include pension funds representing teachers, firefighters, police officers and government workers, among many others, some of which are on the front lines of the pandemic. We take our fiduciary responsibility to them extremely seriously. Core to Apollo's investment philosophy is our ability to both preserve capital and create value for our investors across cycles, especially during economic uncertainty. Apollo founders have been through five cycles over the past 30 years and each downturn presents unique opportunities as we navigate the dislocation and identify misprice risk. Our platform is resilient. Our FRE is durable and growing and we are playing offense utilizing our decades of experience in times of dislocation. In fact, one of the hallmarks of the Apollo brand has been to perform at extraordinary levels in times of market and economic volatility. Our investments have been positioned defensively and our funds portfolio companies remain in good shape. Offensively, we have been investing opportunistically and during the quarter, gross purchases were $40 billion across the platform with another approximate $10 billion in April. We have successfully created value through prior market dislocations by playing both defense and offense. And as Josh will described in greater detail shortly, we expect to continue to do so through the challenging economic environment we see ahead. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Josh to provide an overview of our business operations for the first quarter.\nJosh Harris: Thanks Leon. First, I would like to express my heartfelt wishes to everyone listening at this time to you and the families healthy and safe. For the last few months, we have seen our global workforce come together seamlessly, as Leon mentioned, ensure that our people and portfolio companies are supported through a rapidly changing environment. I am incredibly impressed with the way everyone has risen to the occasion. Thank you to all of our employees. You have done a great job. Turning to the business. I am going to spend some time discussing how we reacted to the significant market volatility that began in late February. But first, let's discuss several critical objectives that we have been accomplishing. Apollo's growth remains a continued focus of management and notwithstanding the difficult first quarter mark-to-market adjustments, we still feel highly confident that we will grow fee related revenues, FRE and AUM in 2020. Notably, as we presented in Investor Day last fall, we believe that FRE and stable FRE margins have durability that are stable, FRE and FRE margins have durability in adverse market environments. Certainly, 2020 is probing us out. Our robust FRE is supported by locked-up and long-duration assets, as over 90% of our AUM is in permanent capital vehicles or have a contractual life of five years or more from inception. In April, Athora closed on the acquisition of VIVAT, adding an incremental $45 billion of assets under management and bringing pro forma assets under management at March 31 to $360 billion. In addition, during Investor Day, we announced that minimum dividend of $0.40 per quarter, which we exceeded this quarter and expect to continue to meet or exceed in subsequent quarters, supported solely by a highly durable FRE base. Lastly on performance fees. These will be realized over a cycle. While we can't predict timing, we are still very confident in the quality of our investment portfolios and returns that they will generate over time. That said, due to the market environment, the portfolio has experienced unrealized mark-to-market volatility during the quarter, which Martin will discuss a bit later. However these portfolios remain in good shape and we don't expect much in the way of impairments over time. While a near term delay in realized performance fees is to be expected as a result of the volatility, we still believe that there will be significant performance fees generated over time. In the meantime, FRE will continue to underpin cash generation and drive our dividend. Given our value orientation heading into this market dislocation, our portfolios were invested in a defensive manner with the expectation of an economic downturn following a decade long bull market. For example, Private Equity Fund VIII portfolio companies were acquired at a 6.5 times enterprise to EBITDA multiple on average, excluding any cost savings and they had only 3.6 times debt to EBITDA or leverage on average, well below industry levels. We invested with an emphasis on durable business model with strong free cash flow and despite the challenging economic environment, we remain confident that Fund VIII will perform well over time. We recently created a watch list that includes companies in stressed situations. As of March 31, these companies represented less than 5% of the current value of Fund VIII. We continue to work with these companies to support their operations and preserve value. Looking back to the last crisis provides some context. At their lowest point, Fund VI and Fund VII are 2006 and 2009 vintage funds, were marked at 0.6 times and 0.5 times at the multiple of net committed capital, respectively at their low points which reflected sharply negative but temporary, I underscore temporary, unrealized marks on existing investments and also created a market environment in which we were able to deploy a lot of new capital at very attractive rates of return. Through March 31, 2020, on that same basis, we have achieved multiples on both of those funds of greater than two times. As of the end of the first quarter, Fund VIII was marked at 1.3 times multiple despite the negative unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the first quarter. As we previously discussed, with respect to credit, as the credit cycle was aging, we have positioned the portfolio towards higher-quality senior secured credit. We had also proactively decreased our exposure to energy and retail. These allocation decisions were particularly beneficial during the first quarter as our credit business meaningfully outperformed the broader credit indices, down 9% in aggregate compared to negative 13% performance for the S&P Leveraged Loan Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index. Of note, credit strategies are multibillion-dollar credit hedge funds was up nearly 10% year-to-date through Wednesday. Deployment. Since the portfolios we manage will defensively positioned, we were able to quickly pivot to offense in the first quarter. During the quarter, we were extremely active and as Leon mentioned, we had gross purchases of approximately $40 billion or roughly double that of a typical quarter, with the majority in March. This is a testament to the strength of our global integrated platform and our broad investment expertise across markets and capital structures. Roughly two-thirds of these gross purchases were concentrated in performing credit mandates with the remaining one-third in opportunistic vehicles. Both of those strategies providing liquidity to the broader markets and certain individual companies. We remained very active in April with approximately $10 billion of gross purchases, aggregating roughly $50 billion of purchases over the last four months. And we continue to monitor a very, very strong pipeline of opportunities across private equity, credit and real assets as the market environment continues to evolve. Our deployment activity during the quarter was indicative of the market backdrop as the Fed moved quickly to enact various monetary and the fiscal authority stimulus programs to support market liquidity and functionality. Markets stabilized across the board. In our view, some portions of the market moved above fundamental value. As pricing in high-grade credit markets recovered, we reduced exposure locking in substantial gains for our clients and are currently repositioning that capital into more idiosyncratic opportunities to capture very attractive risk return opportunities for our clients. In general, while we believe that the broad markets are ahead of fundamentals, there are still a large number of companies that are over levered and in need of restructuring or additional capital, notwithstanding the supportive efforts of the government. With the world's largest alternative credit platform, Apollo is uniquely positioned at the intersection of investors seeking yield and companies looking to borrow funds. We are now increasingly focused on dislocation, direct origination and providing capital solutions for franchised assets. For example, in the last week we announced two capital solutions transactions for our Hybrid Value Fund, including a $1.2 billion preferred equity financing led by Apollo for Expedia, a leading travel platform and a $300 million secured note for Cimpress, a leading global e-commerce provider of customized print, signage, merchandise and other marketing products. These investments highlight what we believe is a true advantage of Apollo's integrated platform combining origination, capital markets and deep industry expertise across the firm to deliver attractive risk return opportunities to investors during volatile times. Fundraising. Moving to fundraising. Apollo's investment capabilities during challenging market conditions is well recognized by our global investor base. To address pockets of market dislocation, we are increasing the target size for certain funds, accelerating the timeline for other fundraisers and launching new strategies. $2 billion dollars of fund raising across several strategies targeting dislocation, origination and capital solutions. The number of incoming calls we are receiving from investors is increasing rapidly. As an example, in the last month, our third Accord fund, which focuses primarily on dislocated corporate credit, called capital and became fully invested within seven business days and we swiftly launched and have already closed on a new $1.5 billion dollars for Accord III B. We expect fundraising for Accord IV will follow shortly. In addition, our Hybrid Value franchise has been highly active in providing capital for great businesses. And we expect to launch Hybrid Value Fund II later this year. Finally, we remain in the market for real assets related to strategies such as infrastructure equity and U.S. and Asian real estate, all of which are seeing attractive opportunities emerge in distressed, stressed and capital solutions. To conclude, since our founding 30 years ago, Apollo has built its reputation on navigating all market environments, but particularly challenging ones. It's very successful on the half of its investors. While our first priority has been and continues to be the wellbeing of the Apollo community and the world at large, we also remain keenly focused on delivering attractive risk return opportunities for our investors and on delivering earnings growth and attractive dividends for our shareholders. With that, I will hand the call over to Martin to cover some of the financial highlights of the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks Josh. As Leon and Josh mentioned, we have seen a tremendous response from all of our employees through this challenging environment. We quickly moved towards a fully remote work construct to ensure the health and safety of all our employees leaning heavily on our technology platform and robust operational processes. We have been very pleased with the seamless transition of our workforce to this new model of working from home, which coincided with one of the most active investing environments that Apollo has ever seen. We announced a dividend of $0.42 per share for the quarter, which is fully supported by our after-tax FRE. During the first quarter, we generated fee related earnings of $0.52 per share on a pretax basis. As Josh mentioned, this quarter underscored the strength and stability of our fee related revenues. Management fees declined by just $5 million or 1.4% during the quarter as realization activity in private equity lowered the fee paying AUM base. The modest impact to management fees resulting from credit and real asset mark-to-market adjustments was offset by capital deployment. The run rate impact on management fees of the widening and credit spreads in March is consistent with the impact we outlined at our Investor Day in November. Costs remain well-controlled, which in conjunction with durable management fees, helped support our FRE margin of 54%, in line with the prior quarter. Notably, over the last 12 months, FRE totaled $2.21 on a per share basis and grew by 8.5% on a dollar basis, driven by 10.6% growth in management fees. Turning to the incentive business. Notwithstanding the $68 million of gross realized performance fees, our pretax incentive earnings were negative for the quarter. In addition to the traditional costs associated with direct profit share interests in realized carry and financing costs associated with that debt and preferred securities, we incurred one-time costs to wind down our managed account arrangement and we funded our incentive pool with a portion of the realized performance fees. AUM declined by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $316 billion, a result of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on our portfolio, offset in part by fundraising. The impact to fee generating AUM during the quarter was more modest, a 2% decline to $242 billion, as our management fee base is largely insulated from unrealized mark-to-market movements. Having said this, on April 1, Athora closed on the acquisition of VIVAT, adding an incremental $45 billion of assets under management for the second quarter and bringing pro forma AUM at March 31 to approximately $360 billion. Of this, permanent capital vehicles amount to more than $200 billion or 57% of our total pro forma AUM. During the quarter, organic inflows continued to be healthy and in line with previous years at $7 billion, particularly in a quarter without an opportunistic flagship fundraise or a strategic platform acquisition. Flows included capital raised by Athora to fund its acquisition of VIVAT, organic growth at Athene and positive flows across a number of credit funds and managed accounts. Gross redemptions, which was 0.1% of beginning of. AUM, reflecting the largely long-dated nature of our funds' capital. These redemptions were more than offset by inflows into those same strategies. Turning to investment performance for the quarter. In private equity, price declines of 21.6% were in line with declines in the broad equity markets. Our energy exposure in private equity remains modest at just 4% of invested assets. In credit and real assets, our overall returns of minus 9% and minus 6.5% outperformed their respective market indices as a result of sector allocation decisions and careful security selection. Our balance sheet was impacted by unrealized negative marks in two respects in the quarter. First, we continue to market our investment in Athene to market, including the additional shares accumulated during the quarter under the equity swap transaction between Apollo and Athene. Since these shares are subject to sale restriction for three years, we take a further discount to the quoted market price to reflect this lock-up. The aggregate impact on our balance sheet of these components was approximately $3 per share. Second, price declines in our investment portfolios reduced our net carry receivable and created a mark-to-market obligation to return carry of $1.31 per share. Ultimately, we believe this obligation is temporary and will not be realized as we remain confident in Fund VIII and more broadly our platform's ability to generate meaningful realized returns over time. Fund VIII would require an approximate 11% appreciation in value from March 31 to remove this obligation, approximately equal to changes in the broad equity markets in April. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to make a few comments regarding liquidity across the firm and our expectations for index inclusion. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. In addition, our dry powder position was robust at the end of the quarter at $41 billion. And as Josh discussed, we see opportunities to raise incremental capital for numerous strategies. Finally, as it relates to index inclusion, we have amended the company's charter and bylaws to reflect the change in the voting rights of our Class A shareholders. We believe these changes should make us eligible for inclusion in the Russell indices as part of their upcoming June rebalance. With that, we will now turn the call back to the operator and open the line for any of your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nLeon Black: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: First, just starting with the FRE stability. Can you walk us through the sources of potential future FRE downside, if any? And I am thinking about marks on NAV based vehicles, CLO management fees and performance revenues. And just help us think about if there could be any downside from these sources of the next few quarters?\nLeon Black: Why don't you --?\nMartin Kelly: Sure. It's Martin. Yes, I will take that. Hi Craig. So as I mentioned in the comments, sensitivity that we outlined at the Investor Day to downward marks has sort of proven out to be de minimis number. Probably that's reflected in the Q1 numbers on their part because it could occurred halfway through the quarter. But as I mentioned, deployment and inflows have mitigated that downdraft. So I use the frame of reference and assumptions that you want to make around where the markets go from here to, as I mentioned, what the impact on management fees looks like. But it's entirely consistent with what was laid out. On CLOs, the structure of our CLO vehicles is such that we are not, most of our fees are protected and in base management fees, we don't have a lot of variability to performance fees in the event of the downgrades on CLOs. So I would sort of, as I mentioned, that as low single digit million dollar range for the balance of the year, even assuming there is downgrades ahead of us. And then in terms of performance revenues, it's low right now. And so, I would sort of assume the current run rate is appropriate for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi. Good morning. Sorry. Josh, when you were kind of going through the view that you would be raising bigger funds and accelerating funds, your line I think cut out for everyone, right when you gave the number in terms of AUM. Could you go through that again? The AUM number.\nJosh Harris: Yes. I think we are looking at lodging strategies that we expect will accumulate $20 billion over the next quarter. And well, I think the other thing I was saying is that and I was talking about them being broadly across many, many credit strategies, everything from capital solutions, hybrid value to market dislocation strategies such as Accord to stressed and distressed strategies. And so that's what I had said. And a number of other origination strategies. And even though, obviously, the Fed has stabilized the markets and broadly the markets, I think what I said were maybe ahead of fundamentals. So there is a lot of opportunities in a lot of great companies that need capital. And so we are there across the board with the broadest alternative credit platform.\nPatrick Davitt: You cut out just on the number. And the number was $20 billion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks. Hi. Good morning everybody. So I wanted to ask you guys on the interplay between deployment and fundraising in today's cycle relative to the financial crisis. I am really thinking about what's the same, what's different, where do you see a big opportunity perhaps today for deployment versus the financial crisis? And then zoning in specifically for Fund IX, I think that Fund is over third committed or deployed. What are your expectations specifically for Fund IX deployment over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months at which point maybe we will starting think about the successor fund? Thanks.\nJosh Harris: Yes. So, we have seen, let's start with the last part of it, like Fund IX has obviously shifted almost entirely into credit kind of distressed for control, stressed investing and we have seen the pace of that fund go up significantly in the last month-and-a-half. And that's continuing into April. And so we would expect acceleration of the pace of Fund IX and we would expect a shift from traditional private equity to a more distressed for control private equity as we allow for our investors to achieve greater risk return in this market environment. In terms of the investors, the investors actually, from our point of view and I think this makes us unique, I was just on the phone with our private equity team right before this and we are getting a tremendous amount of, most people are playing defense and we are getting a tremendous amount of incoming from our investors who have identified us as being uniquely positioned in this environment to take advantage of risk return that exists in the marketplace. And so we are getting a lot of incoming. And unlike the financial crisis where people were generally focused on everyone in the industry, I will talk industry-wide, not calling capital. At least in our case, we are not seeing that at all and maybe with the learning of the financial crisis. But we are seeing people actually calling us up and saying, what new funds are you thinking about? Do you have any co-invest opportunities? In terms of the evolution of our platform and the industry from the financial crisis, I would say on the industry side, the financial crisis was just a massive market dislocation and a breakdown in the markets and then followed by a recession. But there were many, many securities were broad markets were mispriced because of a lack of liquidity in the markets. In this particular crisis, with the appropriate actions of the Federal Reserve and the government, there's a lot of liquidity in the marketplace. But the economic destruction that's occurring because of the unfortunate virus is likely to lead to a longer economic cycle, more of an L than a V. And so there are many, many companies and many, many situations where the leverage isn't appropriate or they need capital. And so we are seeing much more idiosyncratic opportunities to invest on a security-by-security, company-by-company, asset-by-asset basis. And that exists, probably it's going to require patience and take some time and very, very deep detailed and deep industry and company and asset expertise. Jim, do you want to add anything?\nJim Zelter: No. I think I would just add, the evolution of the markets and capital markets and the role we play is just broader and broader. And as Josh mentioned earlier, our fundraising is going to be on dislocation strategies, capital solutions and distressed. He hit the distressed. But certainly I would say in terms of, we have been saying for a few years that the biggest risk out there was the market structure and hence the activity that we put forth on our Accord and our other drawdown vehicles in the quarter that were trigger-based. And also, as we think about our large cap origination potential platform and the success of Hybrid Value [indiscernible] through relatively newer strategies that we have developed over the last five to seven years. So we have a lot more tools in our toolbox from which to be a very active participant in the markets today.\nLeon Black: Just as we...\nJosh Harris: Yes. As I have mentioned, well, go ahead.\nLeon Black: Just to underscore what Josh and Jim have just said and give you a little historical perspective. We have now been through four and this is our fifth down cycle in 30 years. And I think one of the unique things about Apollo in basically setting up the firm 30 years ago as \"a firm of fund for all seasons\" is able to play cycles whether they are going up, down or level. And if you put in perspective, right after the market dislocation 13 years ago, was our Fund VII in private equity. That fund was two-thirds invested in distress. Fund VIII subsequently was less than 5% distressed. So that is the bandwidth vis-\u00e0-vis distress for control that can come out of the private equity funds. And as Josh has said, our expectation is that over the next two years, there are going to be a lot more distressed opportunities. But also to echo what Jim said, we are a very different firm than we were in the first few market dislocations. And our credit platform, the alternative credit platform, just in the last 13 years has grown from $20 billion to something like $240 billion and private equity is now about a quarter of what the firm does. So both the distressed opportunities in private equity, but even as importantly, if not more importantly, what Jim is saying in terms of the opportunities in the alternative credit platform side, we think are going to be massive given the global economic environment.\nJosh Harris: Importantly, 80% of our credit platform is performing. So even though we have always been known as a distressed or stressed from 80% of what we are doing in credit is not that. It's a capital solution that is providing capital to great companies and helping them either deal with a stressful situation or grow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions and all the detailed disclosure. Just sticking with the elevated pace of deployment that you have cited, could you help me understand the waterfall between that incremental pickup and how that might be through fee paying AUM or asset gathering? I am just trying to understand how the economics would then sort of play through to earnings?\nLeon Black: Martin, you want to take it?\nMartin Kelly: Sure. Yes. Bill, I will take that, sure. So let me just frame a few numbers that might help. So we have used this gross purchases, gross price data this quarter in view of the environment that we are in and also just to demonstrate the scale and the breadth of the platform and how active we have been. I view this as a supplementary disclosure this quarter to our typical deployment, which you can see in the documents, which is around $5 billion for the quarter and that's sort of run rate with what's it been. And that lower number is a narrow definition that's specific to some opportunistic drawdown funds that are the flagships. So of the $40 billion, around a third of that, as Josh mentioned, is in funds that are pursuing higher return targets. Most of that was done after the dislocation started to impact us in mid-February on. And the other two-thirds was in performing vehicles which supports the market through a volatile period. You can see the impact of all the activity in the ending fee-gen AUM. So that's the best I could point to look at. And you can also sort of triangulate that with how dry powder has changed relative to inflows over the quarter. But I would say, the $40 billion represents some repositioning. There's some sales in there. Some of that's on leverage. But it all sort of translates itself into what you can see as the fee base in the AUM tables.\nLeon Black: But most of the $40 billion rate or a lot of it would be on behalf of our big insurance clients or in our performing credit vehicles...\nJosh Harris: Correct.\nLeon Black: Which it would not be in the $5 billion and generally that obviously would not ultimately affect fee paying, fee generating AUM for the most part. So you are going to have to pick up incremental capital in those performing credit vehicles to generate the fee paying AUM. And you are going to have to see asset growth in the insurance entities. But on an underlying basis, we feel like that was enormously productive, enormously. So just because it's not translating into fee generating AUM, it's going to translate into a much stronger performance for all those vehicles relative to peers and therefore ultimately into fundraising, which is where you come back around to the $20 billion number and ultimately the opportunity for our insurance platforms to grow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. Two quick ones, one PE, one insurance. On the PE side, I am going to aggregate a bunch of comments you said. But portfolio strong, low entry, more close, low leverage, reduce energy, reduce retail and you defined less than 5% as stressed. So I am sure, the mark on the quarter obviously was almost 22%. I am curious what you think where the market overreacted to? And then, if you could talk about April improvement because it was good month in the market at Athene and ADT obviously got better. But just curious if you could sum that all together for us\nLeon Black: Yes. I mean, our marks are basically a function, our short term marks are a function to a large extent, are driven by like market volatility. And so obviously we have many, many different ways of valuing companies. But certainly, we are a prisoner to how the market looks at things on a very short term basis in the short term relative to unrealized marks going forward. So that's really the sum of it. I mean it's not that the underlying companies are, like I said, I believe our portfolio is in very, very good shape. And the underlying companies themselves, the 5% number is meant to connote how we really feel that we don't really feel like we have a lot of issues. And as we look at and we listen to our investors and try to assess what's going on out there in the world away from us, we think we are in very, very good shape. And we are spending a lot of time, I mean, working on new investments. And obviously, we are not ignoring our portfolio. But the truth of the matter is the marks are for the most part driven by the public markets in a variety of industries and that's not something we can control in the short term. I would say, the 11% that Martin threw out of the S&P rise would get rid of the clawback. And you can look at our public companies. You will see it's ahead of the S&P. And so you get the same reversion on the upside as you do on the downside and that's just unfortunately how the accounting works. But I don't think it's really that consistent in the short run with how the positive nature of how we see our portfolio is doing.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. And I would just underscore, we use public comps extensively. Most of our book is comped against public data. And the dispersion in the marks this quarter was really wide depending on what sector, what industry vertical our portfolio companies set in. So a very volatile period. March 31 didn't catch it at the lows, but it was certainly a lot lower than it is today. And so we expect that to translate into ups. Obviously, in our private books when we go through that process at the end of this quarter as it's coming through to publish.\nLeon Black: Yes. As of March 31, there's a real lack of differentiation in the stock market. Everything just came down. And things, you are a prisoner to that in terms of how you mark your books. That's how you mark it to a large extent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell of Barclays.\nJeremy Campbell: Hi. Thanks guys. I just wanted to clarify one thing on that Martin question. Martin, when you said 11% to remove the impairments on Fund VIII, were you talking about quarter-end? And with the S&P up about 11%, we are kind of already there. And then Josh, I know you have mentioned just now that your book, you think, is ahead. So I am just trying to triangulate that to where we might be sitting today on the marks and the impairment level.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So the clawback or the negative carry, if you like, is a mark-to-market concept and it will reverse and eliminate with an uplift in valuations. And so across the whole portfolio, we would need 11%. It so happens that the broad equity markets are also up by the same number as a guide or as a proxy up. And as Josh mentioned, our public positions are up by more. And we will see where the privates end up for the quarter once we go through that process. But 11% is what's needed to take the clawback back to zero and that takes that issue off the table.\nJim Zelter: I would also like to just add something Josh said about the market not differentiating. Look, there have been many roads to Rome in terms of our industry. We have taken a much more conservative road than many of our peers. There is a real difference in playing growth and paying an average of 11 to 12 times EBITDA and levering it seven times versus what we have done in our model which is to buy companies at 6.5 times and lever them at 3.5 times. We just haven't played the same levered growth model as many others in our industry. And when a sharp correction comes like this, you have to be almost into it and obviously you have to look at it on a case-by-case method, which is what we do. But that's why when we look at our portfolio, there's only 5% of the names that we have put on our watch list. That portfolio is in very good shape.\nLeon Black: Right. We clearly have a very, on a detailed basis, company-by-company, industry-by-industry, we have a very different view of the valuation of our portfolio over time than the market is currently reflecting as of March 31.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. A Form 4 hit on Wednesday night on insider selling a bit over $20 million worth of stock. I know this is just a drop in the bucket in terms of management ownership. But can you talk about how the 10b-5 plans work. And since ESG is getting so much more attention these days, how much control insiders have in terms of selling stock in the days immediately preceding an earnings release?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. I will comment on that. It was a 10b5-1 that was filed last year and with different price points embedded within the grid. And so it took effect in the last week based on where prices were. So it was all predetermined and submitted some time back.\nJosh Harris: Yes. I would just add that the Apollo founders have restricted liquidity, given the notification, information text and other requirements that are put upon them as part of this process. So as Martin said, the sales were actually initiated last November. And then we will put into 10b5-1 which plays out over a long time based on price and volume considerations that are set well in advance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and I hope everyone is doing well. Can you just remind us on the VIVAT, the $45 billion kind of the fee impact, the economic impact? And then also, thinking of it being in Athora, I would certainly expect this environment should create opportunities eventually for them. Can you just remind us on their kind of capacity for transactions over the coming year or so and available capital?\nLeon Black: Sure. So Rob, I will take the first one and then Josh, maybe you take the second one. So VIVAT closed into Athora on April 1, $45 billion. So that fee, all of those assets are fee paying from that date. The fee construct for Athora is similar to how it has been with Athene, in the sense that there's a base management fee, which is lower than it was at Athene given the flexibility or the lower flexibility on managing assets in a European regulatory context. And then there's a sub-advisory component to it. And so the sum of the two are important to the overall economics. The sub-advisory will be low and it will grow over time. And so over time, over a period of years, I would expect that the economics will approximate that of Athene on a dollar-to-dollar basis. But the speed at which that occurs is really dependent on how quickly the sub-advisory asset base grows and in what asset classes.\nJosh Harris: Yes. But when you go out two or three years, we would expect it to be similar to Athene once it ramps on a profitability per AUM basis. So that maybe at least gives you a flavor. But it's going to take a little while to get there depending on our sub-advisory. So going into your first question. Look, the insurance industry, right, has been a very good area in terms of acquisitions for us and for our platforms. And that's just to remind everyone that's because there's been a lot of regulatory pressure on capital. And so big insurance companies have been selling books of business and kind of rightsizing their own businesses. And there has been a tremendous pressure on people's ability to generate yield. And when I look at this environment and pressure on capital, so when I look at this environment, I think this environment will enhance and magnify all those trends. Athora just closed on VIVAT and it used up all its capital. But I will say that it closed in a really unique position. That entity closed in a really unique position having a pristine balance sheet. And so it's a very well-positioned to create yield. And our investors have been very supportive of providing more capital to the extent opportunities arise and I think there will be more opportunities. I think Athene has been going back to, we were talking a lot about. We raised the ADIP fund to invest side-by-side with Athene. And we were talking about a number of about $70 billion in possible dry powder there. And so, we do see the ability to, we think that the industry pressures are going to magnify and we think that we will have opportunities over time. I think, in a period of volatility like this, usually it takes people some period of time, a quarter or two quarters or however long, to sort out like the volatility and rethink their strategies. And so in the short run, you might see a little slowdown. But like, we do think long run, that's going to continue to be a really good area for our platforms and for us.\nLeon Black: And I would just say, Athora raised additional capital in the first quarter, which you can see in the numbers. And so part of that was to complete the funding necessary for VIVAT. But there's still about EUR1 billion of excess capital that has been committed to Athora for other acquisitions over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning everyone. My question is really about kind of the shifting tides here more broadly in the landscape. It sounds like there's going to be a lot to do across your organization. But in these moments, there can be kind of new structural opportunities that get created, like Athene coming out of the last crisis. And so I am just thinking about maybe what some of those could look like? Real estate has been a difficult area for the firm to scale. But that landscape is shifting. Potentially some distressed opportunities coming out of this moment. And so I am curious kind of where real estate fits today as an opportunity to potentially substantially scale or acquire a platform? And maybe same question on infrastructure or anything else I am not thinking about. But it would just seem that you guys typically are pretty smart in these moments when you have pretty extreme dislocation. And so maybe there are some things that could be bigger structural opportunities.\nLeon Black: I will start and I will turn it over to Jim. I mean, I would say broadly across the board whether it be infrastructure, whether it be real estate, I mean, obviously, when the opportunity turns from more of a growth and high valuation growth environment to a more opportunistic credit-driven environment, we tend to scale our platforms, whether it be on yield where we have been doing really well on real estate anyway or even in the more opportunistic funds, we tend to shift the dial from buying equities in a traditional way to doing more so-called distressed for control or stressed. And so across the board, we are going to see opportunities and all of our platforms are going to scale in a positive way relative to kind of the other environment. But Jim, why don't you get into more specifics?\nJim Zelter: Yes. I would say that it's our view that like we saw in 2008, changing evolution, what makes our business interesting is, we can obviously invest in assets and we can also be a rescue or a variety of capital solution for a company. So to your point, there are opportunities for us to play both sides of that. And I would suspect in real estate, we have a large business in the debt side, less from the equity side. So that ability to originate, whether it's broadly more in the triple-net lease space or other areas on real estate, I think you will see us expand. We obviously put our foot in the ground about 24 months ago with the purchase of the infrastructure platform from GE. That's been very well received and the performance has been terrific. So, I think what you are going to see for us strategically expanding now is our robust model tells us that origination in a variety of areas, whether it's credit, real estate, infrastructure, we can continue to expand. And I do think that there are some things, I will give you one little nugget to think about. There certainly is going to be an impact in the CLO market with what's going on with CCC baskets. There's going to be a limitation on CLOs being a solution provider. And therefore, we think about the breadth of the $20 billion that Josh and Leon have talked about, our ability to have vehicles that can fill those cracks and fill those opportunities is really critical to our business. So yes, whenever there's a period like this of dislocation, the sands of origination change, the sands of platforms change and I suspect we will be not only providing solutions for companies and pools of assets, but also holistically which will endure too and order of the benefit of APO as the platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Just a couple of clarifications and then a question for Josh. Just Martin, on the clawback, is that just simply mathematical? If you would reverse that if the returns got above the hurdle or would you use a lower allocation rate and be more conservative against future downturns? And then, just on the timing of the $20 billion fundraising cash, if you could give us the time frame on that? I don't know if I missed that or not. But the broader question, Josh, is on the $40 billion or really $50 billion of gross purchases, taking opportunities in this environment on the performing credit. How would you compare this to the environment in 1Q 2016 where we also had a dislocation albeit it that was quite brief? And so do you see more opportunities in this environment? Or just the Fed credit backstop sort of also make this more of a short-lived performing credit opportunity?\nJosh Harris: So I mean on the second one, I think it would be much longer lived because at the end of the day, the economy itself is really, really hurting. And when the Federal Reserve steps in, obviously that creates great market functionality. But what it can't do is, it can't throw, there's a lot of companies that have no revenues. I was looking at the consensus, GDP estimates in the second quarter down 30%. No one knows. But when you add, when you take all the averages, you are talking about down 30%. And then how fast and we don't really see, like I said in some of my other comments, I think this is going to take a while. Consumer behavior is going to change. I don't think as the opening itself will take a while and be very staged, there will be ups and downs to it. And unfortunately, we are going to go through in a difficult economy for a decent longer term period of time. And so ultimately a lot of the leverage that existed in the system is too high for cash flows that don't exist over a medium term. And therefore there's going to have to be a deleveraging of the system where capital is key and providing liquidity is key. So I think it will be a much longer situation than you saw in 2016, which was pretty much of a V and sort of more sentiment-based. In terms of the $20 billion, go ahead. Go ahead, Jim.\nJim Zelter: I am sorry. Go ahead, Josh. Sorry.\nJosh Harris: No. In terms of the $20 billion, we said we are going to, we expect it's over the next year is what we said.\nJim Zelter: And I would add one thing. As Josh said, 2016, 2015, 2016 was about oil and Chinese growth. This is much longer lasting. And I think the theme that we have been talking about and addressing in our platform is, yes, the IG market is open. For the best companies, whether it's Boeing yesterday, massive liquidity because of the Fed programs in the IG marketplace. But in the broad economy, the asset-backed-businesses, franchise finance, SME lending, those industries and those funding vehicles are still, I don't want to say they are broken, but there's sand in the gears and there's underlying economic concerns. So when we think about the breadth of our platform and what's going on in the headlines in the last few weeks, very interesting. The Fed and Treasury and the government's done a great job. But as Josh and I are talking about, just the extensive impact, you can shut the economy down in a few days, it takes weeks, months and quarters to restart it. And it's that type of environment that we will be active in the breadth of our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara of Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Perhaps just one on kind of the insurance business and sort of the impact of this sort of low rate environment, how you kind of see that growing, I guess, on an organic basis? And then if memory serves, the liquidity discount that was cited in this quarter with respect to Athene, is that sort of it comes down over time, if I am recalling that correctly? But perhaps, you could kind of refresh us on how that works from a valuation perspective going forward? Thank you.\nLeon Black: Martin, do you want to grab that?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So Gerry, that's quick one. So yes, the discount is just a term of the lockup and the volatility in the stock. So it's formulaic. It's like an option pricing model. It burns off with time, subject to where it all goes from here. So if vol was flat, you would expect to see a straight line drop off, but it will do whatever vol does between now and three years from now.\nLeon Black: I mean, generally I would say, the insurance companies continue to grow organically. You can look at the first quarter and see that. But the low rates really should pressure. It can create a lot of more strategic transactions, sales of books of business, sales of businesses, the ability to buy large chunks of liabilities as some of the other trends that I talked about earlier start to impact the industry at large. And so those people that have capital and those people that have the ability to invest add a little bit of a higher return in a appropriate risk-adjusted way. Those companies and we count our platforms among those companies will be there to be helpful and supportive of the industry in terms how the industry itself is going to restructure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.\nChris Harris: Thanks. Hi guys. if we are sitting here six months from now and COVID is still around and there are no meetings or limited travel, how might that impact your ability to fundraise going forward? And in particular, wondering about the successor to Fund IX?\nLeon Black: Yes. So I mean I have been actually amazed. I mean I have been on just many, many Zoom calls with Asia, with States, with other geographies around the globe. And there have been a number of annual meetings that have been over video, over Zoom or other services. And like I said, we have been closing capital. The investors, other people have been where they have fundraisings and process has been continuing to close. And so the industry at large has moved very quickly online. And so I mean I would say, it hasn't really missed a beat, which is surprising to say that but at least that's my observation so far. And like I said earlier also, unlike the financial crisis where we did have a small number even for us but there was a broader number for others of LPs that said, look, if you don't have to make a capital call, don't make a capital call and we are not open for business. We really haven't seen that. Certainly, from our point of view, we are seeing like people go the other way and say, do you have co-invest? What new funds are you raising like? And I mentioned the Accord III B fund where we literally in a month or three weeks after we have spend Accord III much more quickly than we thought closed $1.5 billion. And that was a lot of incoming and that was way ahead. When we started it, we had penciled it in to take another 30 or 60 days longer and people were just moving much more quickly. So, we haven't seen the concern that you are raising has not manifested itself. And if anything, I see it sort of slightly going the other way.\nMartin Kelly: I would amplify on that. I mean, why do institutions give us money? They give us money, one, for performance. And, two, they give us money because we have created a chemistry of trust and a relationship over time. We have been at this 30 years now. We have a AAA group of institutional investors. And as long as we keep performing, the world, I mean, in the last few years has broken up to the haves and have-nots. The large private equity funds that have been in business and have created this chemistry have garnered outsized percentages of the money that's out there. And there's a lot of capital out there. In an ultra-low interest rate environment, there is a lot of cash still around looking for yields, looking for returns. And so I would agree with Josh. If anything, this will continue to play to our benefit as long as we perform because we already do have 30-year relationships with the large pools of capital that exists. More specifically to Fund IX, again we are bullied. Look, I have been able to perform in good times and bad. But clearly distressed environments have played in our favor historically over the last 30 years with five downcycles. But in Fund IX, we are about a third invested. That was a $25 billion fund. So even with outsized opportunities that's probably is going to be at least 18 to 24 months before we are out fundraising again there.\nOperator: Your next question --\nJim Zelter: Right. And I have heard, just to underscore Leon's point, like I have heard from a lot of investors that the bigger branded players in general, the trusted players like, it's much harder now. If you don't know someone you are trying to raise a first time fund and you are trying to do the first meeting or resume or the second or third or the fifth, it's much harder. But for someone you have been in business with for many years, we are benefiting and the large branded funds are benefiting from that trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a bigger picture question. Curious for your views or perspectives, what sort of changes we could see the consumer and corporate behavior on the other side of this crisis? And also given the growing deficits and concerns around state and local budget shortfalls and central bank actions, I guess, what sort of implications do you see for inflation, tax rates and the investing landscape?\nJosh Harris: Well, I will start and maybe Jim or Leon can pile on. I would say that certainly consumer behavior, I mean, consumers represent 70% of the U.S. GDP. And clearly everything from all types of services, certainly restaurants, certainly events, people, Disney is talking about the capacity of their parks being lower. So kind of restaurants, events, meetings, there will be a significant change in the consumer behavior in terms of people's willingness to interact with others for some period of time unless there's a vaccination or a cure found, which I think is more hopeful. But it continues to be unclear whether that's going to happen. So you are going to see a lot of that. You are going to see an acceleration of what people do online obviously. And so those would be some of the considerations that I would talk about. In terms of inflation, there's just really no hint of inflation right now. There's just a massive lack of demand because consumers are just not buying what they were buying. And so even though you would expect that when there's this massive influx of money and massive fiscal stimulus there might be inflation. It's well below the targets that have been laid out there by the Federal Reserve and others. And there's a lot of slack in the global economy and a lot of slack in the U.S. economy. And so you might see it selectively. But it's just not showing up right now. And you can just look at the price of oil and commodities, right and see certainly that part of it which tends to correlate is way down. So I don't know, Jim or Leon, if you have any other comments?\nLeon Black: I think you hit them, Josh. I think the idea of higher rates any time soon, let's say, for this decade we are going to be in a very low rate environment. And there's going to be, the government were piling on a lot of debt. But I think Josh really hit the two most important points.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America.\nMike Carrier: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just a question on the private versus public. So on the public market, there's a bounce back and sort of interesting policy moves and some hopes on reopening. But the economic outlook of private company fundamentals seem to paint a different outlook. And it looks like you were able to take advantage and create value on the public side in March and April. Can you provide some more color? And just what way we can try to assess the portfolio companies bridge the gap until the economy returns to like a new normal including how much capital is in reserve in the funds?\nJosh Harris: Yes. Look, I will start probably and then, Martin, I don't know how much of those numbers that we released. But I would say that, look, we came into this with very low leverage and a lot of liquidity and very few covenants and very low maturities or amortization and a lot of flexibility in our credit documents. So we sort of did a lot of the planning in advance. We have been, I think publicly saying for a while that we foresaw that something, we didn't know what but that we worried about volatility and economic downturns and something could happen. And so our portfolio today from a liquidity and from an amortization standpoint is in very good shape. And the fact that we bought it at very low multiples is serving us very well. And the cash flows themselves are not uniformly but hanging in there pretty significantly. And we are underweight energy. We are underweight retail. And a lot of the sectors that have been hit the hardest, travel and all that and things like that, we just didn't have a lot of that leisure hotels. And so, like we are very well positioned right now from a portfolio standpoint. Obviously what you would do and should do is think about how do you preserve liquidity? What can you do to do that? And raising capital and a marketplace that we think is technically driven and ahead of itself. And so we are looking at opportunities to do that. I mean, Martin, I don't know if you want to add on the fund liquidity. We have ample liquidity. I mean we spend a lot of time on this. I don't know what it really is. But we are very focused on funding liquidity. There's ample liquidity. We have more than enough liquidity for any sort of issues. And what we are now spending a lot of time on, enormous time on is like how do we spend the excess liquidity and funding on offense. And so that's how we are spending our time. I don't know if we released the numbers.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. I think that covers it\nLeon Black: And if I could just add. I think that question, Josh, obviously addressed it for us, but it's the other side of that coin that gets us being very thoughtful and optimistic about our landscape because many other firms, investors, companies out there are probably a bit more levered and whether it's the solutions we brought to Expedia or Cimpress this past week, many, many, many tools we have will allow us to be that provider of solution capital. So again, well, it may not be as relevant to Apollo because of our discipline and value, it's certainly relevant for many, many other swaths of the economy.\nJosh Harris: Yes. And we are obviously ahead of, because we have been playing so much offense. We are looking across the landscape and we have 40 just in private equity alone and Jim can take the credit, we have 40 open to buys. We have reviewed hundreds and hundreds of companies and not everyone was thinking the way we were thinking. And so that provides, we are going to have opportunities and not just private equity based companies but public companies. It was really hard to predict. The fact that, I mean, no one predicted the kind of revenue loss that has existed. And basically in many, many industries, when you have no revenues and you have fixed costs, like there's a need for cash to get over the hump at a minimum. And so we have a very large funnel of opportunities to take advantage of.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.\nChris Kotowski: Yes. Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to go back to slide 12 and the clawback liability because last quarter you had the realized loss in Constellis. And then you said, okay, the next whatever it was $100 million or so of realized gains would be dedicated there. And years ago, KKR had this concept of a netting hole of mark-to-market positions that could only be refilled with realized gains. But what you are saying is, this $1.31 of clawback liability that just goes away even with unrealized appreciation. And so if you had 11% or more appreciation and then had realized gains, that would generate distributable earnings then?\nLeon Black: Yes, Chris, for sure. So it's a point in time mark-to-market. It's the same on the negative side on the clawback or the payable side as it is on the upside. And so we determined what we think are the appropriate valuations for all the companies in the fund and the portfolio. And then we impute carry off that. And this arises because Fund VIII has made prior distributions of carry. And so at a point in time at March 31, using those unrealized marks, that would be the imputed repayment. But it reverses itself with unrealized appreciation at the same way that normal carry is sort of created and booked with appreciation. So it's symmetrical.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our final question for this morning. I will now return the call to Gary Stein for any additional or closing comments.\nGary Stein: Great. Thanks operator and thanks everyone. Appreciate spending time with us this morning and we look forward to speaking with you again shortly. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me or Ann. Thanks.\nLeon Black: Stay healthy.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Apollo Global Management's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Josh Harris",
            "content": "Thanks Leon. First, I would like to express my heartfelt wishes to everyone listening at this time to you and the families healthy and safe. For the last few months, we have seen our global workforce come together seamlessly, as Leon mentioned, ensure that our people and portfolio companies are supported through a rapidly changing environment. I am incredibly impressed with the way everyone has risen to the occasion. Thank you to all of our employees. You have done a great job. Turning to the business. I am going to spend some time discussing how we reacted to the significant market volatility that began in late February. But first, let's discuss several critical objectives that we have been accomplishing. Apollo's growth remains a continued focus of management and notwithstanding the difficult first quarter mark-to-market adjustments, we still feel highly confident that we will grow fee related revenues, FRE and AUM in 2020. Notably, as we presented in Investor Day last fall, we believe that FRE and stable FRE margins have durability that are stable, FRE and FRE margins have durability in adverse market environments. Certainly, 2020 is probing us out. Our robust FRE is supported by locked-up and long-duration assets, as over 90% of our AUM is in permanent capital vehicles or have a contractual life of five years or more from inception. In April, Athora closed on the acquisition of VIVAT, adding an incremental $45 billion of assets under management and bringing pro forma assets under management at March 31 to $360 billion. In addition, during Investor Day, we announced that minimum dividend of $0.40 per quarter, which we exceeded this quarter and expect to continue to meet or exceed in subsequent quarters, supported solely by a highly durable FRE base. Lastly on performance fees. These will be realized over a cycle. While we can't predict timing, we are still very confident in the quality of our investment portfolios and returns that they will generate over time. That said, due to the market environment, the portfolio has experienced unrealized mark-to-market volatility during the quarter, which Martin will discuss a bit later. However these portfolios remain in good shape and we don't expect much in the way of impairments over time. While a near term delay in realized performance fees is to be expected as a result of the volatility, we still believe that there will be significant performance fees generated over time. In the meantime, FRE will continue to underpin cash generation and drive our dividend. Given our value orientation heading into this market dislocation, our portfolios were invested in a defensive manner with the expectation of an economic downturn following a decade long bull market. For example, Private Equity Fund VIII portfolio companies were acquired at a 6.5 times enterprise to EBITDA multiple on average, excluding any cost savings and they had only 3.6 times debt to EBITDA or leverage on average, well below industry levels. We invested with an emphasis on durable business model with strong free cash flow and despite the challenging economic environment, we remain confident that Fund VIII will perform well over time. We recently created a watch list that includes companies in stressed situations. As of March 31, these companies represented less than 5% of the current value of Fund VIII. We continue to work with these companies to support their operations and preserve value. Looking back to the last crisis provides some context. At their lowest point, Fund VI and Fund VII are 2006 and 2009 vintage funds, were marked at 0.6 times and 0.5 times at the multiple of net committed capital, respectively at their low points which reflected sharply negative but temporary, I underscore temporary, unrealized marks on existing investments and also created a market environment in which we were able to deploy a lot of new capital at very attractive rates of return. Through March 31, 2020, on that same basis, we have achieved multiples on both of those funds of greater than two times. As of the end of the first quarter, Fund VIII was marked at 1.3 times multiple despite the negative unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the first quarter. As we previously discussed, with respect to credit, as the credit cycle was aging, we have positioned the portfolio towards higher-quality senior secured credit. We had also proactively decreased our exposure to energy and retail. These allocation decisions were particularly beneficial during the first quarter as our credit business meaningfully outperformed the broader credit indices, down 9% in aggregate compared to negative 13% performance for the S&P Leveraged Loan Index and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index. Of note, credit strategies are multibillion-dollar credit hedge funds was up nearly 10% year-to-date through Wednesday. Deployment. Since the portfolios we manage will defensively positioned, we were able to quickly pivot to offense in the first quarter. During the quarter, we were extremely active and as Leon mentioned, we had gross purchases of approximately $40 billion or roughly double that of a typical quarter, with the majority in March. This is a testament to the strength of our global integrated platform and our broad investment expertise across markets and capital structures. Roughly two-thirds of these gross purchases were concentrated in performing credit mandates with the remaining one-third in opportunistic vehicles. Both of those strategies providing liquidity to the broader markets and certain individual companies. We remained very active in April with approximately $10 billion of gross purchases, aggregating roughly $50 billion of purchases over the last four months. And we continue to monitor a very, very strong pipeline of opportunities across private equity, credit and real assets as the market environment continues to evolve. Our deployment activity during the quarter was indicative of the market backdrop as the Fed moved quickly to enact various monetary and the fiscal authority stimulus programs to support market liquidity and functionality. Markets stabilized across the board. In our view, some portions of the market moved above fundamental value. As pricing in high-grade credit markets recovered, we reduced exposure locking in substantial gains for our clients and are currently repositioning that capital into more idiosyncratic opportunities to capture very attractive risk return opportunities for our clients. In general, while we believe that the broad markets are ahead of fundamentals, there are still a large number of companies that are over levered and in need of restructuring or additional capital, notwithstanding the supportive efforts of the government. With the world's largest alternative credit platform, Apollo is uniquely positioned at the intersection of investors seeking yield and companies looking to borrow funds. We are now increasingly focused on dislocation, direct origination and providing capital solutions for franchised assets. For example, in the last week we announced two capital solutions transactions for our Hybrid Value Fund, including a $1.2 billion preferred equity financing led by Apollo for Expedia, a leading travel platform and a $300 million secured note for Cimpress, a leading global e-commerce provider of customized print, signage, merchandise and other marketing products. These investments highlight what we believe is a true advantage of Apollo's integrated platform combining origination, capital markets and deep industry expertise across the firm to deliver attractive risk return opportunities to investors during volatile times. Fundraising. Moving to fundraising. Apollo's investment capabilities during challenging market conditions is well recognized by our global investor base. To address pockets of market dislocation, we are increasing the target size for certain funds, accelerating the timeline for other fundraisers and launching new strategies. $2 billion dollars of fund raising across several strategies targeting dislocation, origination and capital solutions. The number of incoming calls we are receiving from investors is increasing rapidly. As an example, in the last month, our third Accord fund, which focuses primarily on dislocated corporate credit, called capital and became fully invested within seven business days and we swiftly launched and have already closed on a new $1.5 billion dollars for Accord III B. We expect fundraising for Accord IV will follow shortly. In addition, our Hybrid Value franchise has been highly active in providing capital for great businesses. And we expect to launch Hybrid Value Fund II later this year. Finally, we remain in the market for real assets related to strategies such as infrastructure equity and U.S. and Asian real estate, all of which are seeing attractive opportunities emerge in distressed, stressed and capital solutions. To conclude, since our founding 30 years ago, Apollo has built its reputation on navigating all market environments, but particularly challenging ones. It's very successful on the half of its investors. While our first priority has been and continues to be the wellbeing of the Apollo community and the world at large, we also remain keenly focused on delivering attractive risk return opportunities for our investors and on delivering earnings growth and attractive dividends for our shareholders. With that, I will hand the call over to Martin to cover some of the financial highlights of the quarter in greater detail. Thank you. Yes. I think we are looking at lodging strategies that we expect will accumulate $20 billion over the next quarter. And well, I think the other thing I was saying is that and I was talking about them being broadly across many, many credit strategies, everything from capital solutions, hybrid value to market dislocation strategies such as Accord to stressed and distressed strategies. And so that's what I had said. And a number of other origination strategies. And even though, obviously, the Fed has stabilized the markets and broadly the markets, I think what I said were maybe ahead of fundamentals. So there is a lot of opportunities in a lot of great companies that need capital. And so we are there across the board with the broadest alternative credit platform. Yes. So, we have seen, let's start with the last part of it, like Fund IX has obviously shifted almost entirely into credit kind of distressed for control, stressed investing and we have seen the pace of that fund go up significantly in the last month-and-a-half. And that's continuing into April. And so we would expect acceleration of the pace of Fund IX and we would expect a shift from traditional private equity to a more distressed for control private equity as we allow for our investors to achieve greater risk return in this market environment. In terms of the investors, the investors actually, from our point of view and I think this makes us unique, I was just on the phone with our private equity team right before this and we are getting a tremendous amount of, most people are playing defense and we are getting a tremendous amount of incoming from our investors who have identified us as being uniquely positioned in this environment to take advantage of risk return that exists in the marketplace. And so we are getting a lot of incoming. And unlike the financial crisis where people were generally focused on everyone in the industry, I will talk industry-wide, not calling capital. At least in our case, we are not seeing that at all and maybe with the learning of the financial crisis. But we are seeing people actually calling us up and saying, what new funds are you thinking about? Do you have any co-invest opportunities? In terms of the evolution of our platform and the industry from the financial crisis, I would say on the industry side, the financial crisis was just a massive market dislocation and a breakdown in the markets and then followed by a recession. But there were many, many securities were broad markets were mispriced because of a lack of liquidity in the markets. In this particular crisis, with the appropriate actions of the Federal Reserve and the government, there's a lot of liquidity in the marketplace. But the economic destruction that's occurring because of the unfortunate virus is likely to lead to a longer economic cycle, more of an L than a V. And so there are many, many companies and many, many situations where the leverage isn't appropriate or they need capital. And so we are seeing much more idiosyncratic opportunities to invest on a security-by-security, company-by-company, asset-by-asset basis. And that exists, probably it's going to require patience and take some time and very, very deep detailed and deep industry and company and asset expertise. Jim, do you want to add anything? Yes. As I have mentioned, well, go ahead. Importantly, 80% of our credit platform is performing. So even though we have always been known as a distressed or stressed from 80% of what we are doing in credit is not that. It's a capital solution that is providing capital to great companies and helping them either deal with a stressful situation or grow. Correct. Yes. I would just add that the Apollo founders have restricted liquidity, given the notification, information text and other requirements that are put upon them as part of this process. So as Martin said, the sales were actually initiated last November. And then we will put into 10b5-1 which plays out over a long time based on price and volume considerations that are set well in advance. Yes. But when you go out two or three years, we would expect it to be similar to Athene once it ramps on a profitability per AUM basis. So that maybe at least gives you a flavor. But it's going to take a little while to get there depending on our sub-advisory. So going into your first question. Look, the insurance industry, right, has been a very good area in terms of acquisitions for us and for our platforms. And that's just to remind everyone that's because there's been a lot of regulatory pressure on capital. And so big insurance companies have been selling books of business and kind of rightsizing their own businesses. And there has been a tremendous pressure on people's ability to generate yield. And when I look at this environment and pressure on capital, so when I look at this environment, I think this environment will enhance and magnify all those trends. Athora just closed on VIVAT and it used up all its capital. But I will say that it closed in a really unique position. That entity closed in a really unique position having a pristine balance sheet. And so it's a very well-positioned to create yield. And our investors have been very supportive of providing more capital to the extent opportunities arise and I think there will be more opportunities. I think Athene has been going back to, we were talking a lot about. We raised the ADIP fund to invest side-by-side with Athene. And we were talking about a number of about $70 billion in possible dry powder there. And so, we do see the ability to, we think that the industry pressures are going to magnify and we think that we will have opportunities over time. I think, in a period of volatility like this, usually it takes people some period of time, a quarter or two quarters or however long, to sort out like the volatility and rethink their strategies. And so in the short run, you might see a little slowdown. But like, we do think long run, that's going to continue to be a really good area for our platforms and for us. So I mean on the second one, I think it would be much longer lived because at the end of the day, the economy itself is really, really hurting. And when the Federal Reserve steps in, obviously that creates great market functionality. But what it can't do is, it can't throw, there's a lot of companies that have no revenues. I was looking at the consensus, GDP estimates in the second quarter down 30%. No one knows. But when you add, when you take all the averages, you are talking about down 30%. And then how fast and we don't really see, like I said in some of my other comments, I think this is going to take a while. Consumer behavior is going to change. I don't think as the opening itself will take a while and be very staged, there will be ups and downs to it. And unfortunately, we are going to go through in a difficult economy for a decent longer term period of time. And so ultimately a lot of the leverage that existed in the system is too high for cash flows that don't exist over a medium term. And therefore there's going to have to be a deleveraging of the system where capital is key and providing liquidity is key. So I think it will be a much longer situation than you saw in 2016, which was pretty much of a V and sort of more sentiment-based. In terms of the $20 billion, go ahead. Go ahead, Jim. No. In terms of the $20 billion, we said we are going to, we expect it's over the next year is what we said. Well, I will start and maybe Jim or Leon can pile on. I would say that certainly consumer behavior, I mean, consumers represent 70% of the U.S. GDP. And clearly everything from all types of services, certainly restaurants, certainly events, people, Disney is talking about the capacity of their parks being lower. So kind of restaurants, events, meetings, there will be a significant change in the consumer behavior in terms of people's willingness to interact with others for some period of time unless there's a vaccination or a cure found, which I think is more hopeful. But it continues to be unclear whether that's going to happen. So you are going to see a lot of that. You are going to see an acceleration of what people do online obviously. And so those would be some of the considerations that I would talk about. In terms of inflation, there's just really no hint of inflation right now. There's just a massive lack of demand because consumers are just not buying what they were buying. And so even though you would expect that when there's this massive influx of money and massive fiscal stimulus there might be inflation. It's well below the targets that have been laid out there by the Federal Reserve and others. And there's a lot of slack in the global economy and a lot of slack in the U.S. economy. And so you might see it selectively. But it's just not showing up right now. And you can just look at the price of oil and commodities, right and see certainly that part of it which tends to correlate is way down. So I don't know, Jim or Leon, if you have any other comments? Yes. Look, I will start probably and then, Martin, I don't know how much of those numbers that we released. But I would say that, look, we came into this with very low leverage and a lot of liquidity and very few covenants and very low maturities or amortization and a lot of flexibility in our credit documents. So we sort of did a lot of the planning in advance. We have been, I think publicly saying for a while that we foresaw that something, we didn't know what but that we worried about volatility and economic downturns and something could happen. And so our portfolio today from a liquidity and from an amortization standpoint is in very good shape. And the fact that we bought it at very low multiples is serving us very well. And the cash flows themselves are not uniformly but hanging in there pretty significantly. And we are underweight energy. We are underweight retail. And a lot of the sectors that have been hit the hardest, travel and all that and things like that, we just didn't have a lot of that leisure hotels. And so, like we are very well positioned right now from a portfolio standpoint. Obviously what you would do and should do is think about how do you preserve liquidity? What can you do to do that? And raising capital and a marketplace that we think is technically driven and ahead of itself. And so we are looking at opportunities to do that. I mean, Martin, I don't know if you want to add on the fund liquidity. We have ample liquidity. I mean we spend a lot of time on this. I don't know what it really is. But we are very focused on funding liquidity. There's ample liquidity. We have more than enough liquidity for any sort of issues. And what we are now spending a lot of time on, enormous time on is like how do we spend the excess liquidity and funding on offense. And so that's how we are spending our time. I don't know if we released the numbers. Yes. And we are obviously ahead of, because we have been playing so much offense. We are looking across the landscape and we have 40 just in private equity alone and Jim can take the credit, we have 40 open to buys. We have reviewed hundreds and hundreds of companies and not everyone was thinking the way we were thinking. And so that provides, we are going to have opportunities and not just private equity based companies but public companies. It was really hard to predict. The fact that, I mean, no one predicted the kind of revenue loss that has existed. And basically in many, many industries, when you have no revenues and you have fixed costs, like there's a need for cash to get over the hump at a minimum. And so we have a very large funnel of opportunities to take advantage of."

            "name": "Leon Black",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks Gary and thank you all for joining us. I would like to focus my comments this morning on the unprecedented circumstances we are collectively facing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. What began as a virus has become a global health and economic crisis of enormous proportions and we, first and foremost, like to extend our thanks to all of the healthcare professionals and frontline workers for their extraordinary dedication through these difficult times. I would also like to thank our Apollo employees for their continued hard work and commitment to the firm over the past couple of months. The enduring strength of our business is a testament to all of their individual contributions. On behalf of the management team, we extend our appreciation. As the crisis began to unfold a couple of months ago, our first order of business was to ensure the safety, health and wellness of our employees and their families and we continue to monitor their wellbeing provide ongoing support. We then quickly turned our attention to preserving business continuity across the firm. Apollo has rapidly adjusted to working remotely further embracing technology to ensure a relatively seamless transition to work from home environment across the firm's 15 offices around the world. Additionally, over the past couple of months, we have spent a great deal of time with the portfolio companies in the various funds we manage. In early March, we created a portfolio crisis response team, which has been meeting daily and remains in constant communication with the management of our funds portfolio companies ensuring best practices are shared across areas such as healthcare, business operations and capital management. With respect to the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program or PPP, none of the companies controlled by Apollo or the funds we manage will be utilizing this program. Similarly, although we are still reviewing the guidance recently announced by the Federal Reserve, we do not anticipate that the Main Street Lending Program will provide any relief or financial assistance to companies controlled by us or our funds. We have been able to leverage the knowledge across the Apollo platform to provide advice and support to these businesses. As Josh will discuss in greater detail shortly, the investment portfolios remain in good shape due to our consistent focus on value pricing discipline, conservative underwriting and use of the less leveraged than the industry. In considering the tremendous pressure that COVID has placed on our society as we unite to fight this pandemic, we have also placed an emphasis on identifying how we can support and empower the communities around us. Between Apollo and current portfolio companies, our shared efforts amount to over $50 million in relief effort contributions globally to-date. Various portfolio companies have also stepped up to provide aid in other ways. As an example, Diamond Resorts is providing free lodging to healthcare workers and first responders while LifePoint as partnered with authorities to set up a temporary hospital and has participated in drive-by COVID testing events. McGraw-Hill Education is offering free access to online Higher Ed coursework and training professors and students to transition to digital learning platform. And Shutterfly and Amissima, among others, secured, funded and donated items such as masks, ventilators and hospital supplies. These are just a handful example out of many and I could not be more proud of our employees and those in our funds' portfolio companies who have assisted and championed these efforts. Amid these challenging circumstances, we have been able to demonstrate the resiliency of the Apollo model. Now more than ever, Apollo is well-positioned to preserve and drive exceptional value to our investors, which include pension funds representing teachers, firefighters, police officers and government workers, among many others, some of which are on the front lines of the pandemic. We take our fiduciary responsibility to them extremely seriously. Core to Apollo's investment philosophy is our ability to both preserve capital and create value for our investors across cycles, especially during economic uncertainty. Apollo founders have been through five cycles over the past 30 years and each downturn presents unique opportunities as we navigate the dislocation and identify misprice risk. Our platform is resilient. Our FRE is durable and growing and we are playing offense utilizing our decades of experience in times of dislocation. In fact, one of the hallmarks of the Apollo brand has been to perform at extraordinary levels in times of market and economic volatility. Our investments have been positioned defensively and our funds portfolio companies remain in good shape. Offensively, we have been investing opportunistically and during the quarter, gross purchases were $40 billion across the platform with another approximate $10 billion in April. We have successfully created value through prior market dislocations by playing both defense and offense. And as Josh will described in greater detail shortly, we expect to continue to do so through the challenging economic environment we see ahead. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Josh to provide an overview of our business operations for the first quarter. Good morning. Why don't you --? Just as we... Just to underscore what Josh and Jim have just said and give you a little historical perspective. We have now been through four and this is our fifth down cycle in 30 years. And I think one of the unique things about Apollo in basically setting up the firm 30 years ago as \"a firm of fund for all seasons\" is able to play cycles whether they are going up, down or level. And if you put in perspective, right after the market dislocation 13 years ago, was our Fund VII in private equity. That fund was two-thirds invested in distress. Fund VIII subsequently was less than 5% distressed. So that is the bandwidth vis-\u00e0-vis distress for control that can come out of the private equity funds. And as Josh has said, our expectation is that over the next two years, there are going to be a lot more distressed opportunities. But also to echo what Jim said, we are a very different firm than we were in the first few market dislocations. And our credit platform, the alternative credit platform, just in the last 13 years has grown from $20 billion to something like $240 billion and private equity is now about a quarter of what the firm does. So both the distressed opportunities in private equity, but even as importantly, if not more importantly, what Jim is saying in terms of the opportunities in the alternative credit platform side, we think are going to be massive given the global economic environment. Martin, you want to take it? But most of the $40 billion rate or a lot of it would be on behalf of our big insurance clients or in our performing credit vehicles... Which it would not be in the $5 billion and generally that obviously would not ultimately affect fee paying, fee generating AUM for the most part. So you are going to have to pick up incremental capital in those performing credit vehicles to generate the fee paying AUM. And you are going to have to see asset growth in the insurance entities. But on an underlying basis, we feel like that was enormously productive, enormously. So just because it's not translating into fee generating AUM, it's going to translate into a much stronger performance for all those vehicles relative to peers and therefore ultimately into fundraising, which is where you come back around to the $20 billion number and ultimately the opportunity for our insurance platforms to grow. Yes. I mean, our marks are basically a function, our short term marks are a function to a large extent, are driven by like market volatility. And so obviously we have many, many different ways of valuing companies. But certainly, we are a prisoner to how the market looks at things on a very short term basis in the short term relative to unrealized marks going forward. So that's really the sum of it. I mean it's not that the underlying companies are, like I said, I believe our portfolio is in very, very good shape. And the underlying companies themselves, the 5% number is meant to connote how we really feel that we don't really feel like we have a lot of issues. And as we look at and we listen to our investors and try to assess what's going on out there in the world away from us, we think we are in very, very good shape. And we are spending a lot of time, I mean, working on new investments. And obviously, we are not ignoring our portfolio. But the truth of the matter is the marks are for the most part driven by the public markets in a variety of industries and that's not something we can control in the short term. I would say, the 11% that Martin threw out of the S&P rise would get rid of the clawback. And you can look at our public companies. You will see it's ahead of the S&P. And so you get the same reversion on the upside as you do on the downside and that's just unfortunately how the accounting works. But I don't think it's really that consistent in the short run with how the positive nature of how we see our portfolio is doing. Yes. As of March 31, there's a real lack of differentiation in the stock market. Everything just came down. And things, you are a prisoner to that in terms of how you mark your books. That's how you mark it to a large extent. Right. We clearly have a very, on a detailed basis, company-by-company, industry-by-industry, we have a very different view of the valuation of our portfolio over time than the market is currently reflecting as of March 31. Sure. So Rob, I will take the first one and then Josh, maybe you take the second one. So VIVAT closed into Athora on April 1, $45 billion. So that fee, all of those assets are fee paying from that date. The fee construct for Athora is similar to how it has been with Athene, in the sense that there's a base management fee, which is lower than it was at Athene given the flexibility or the lower flexibility on managing assets in a European regulatory context. And then there's a sub-advisory component to it. And so the sum of the two are important to the overall economics. The sub-advisory will be low and it will grow over time. And so over time, over a period of years, I would expect that the economics will approximate that of Athene on a dollar-to-dollar basis. But the speed at which that occurs is really dependent on how quickly the sub-advisory asset base grows and in what asset classes. And I would just say, Athora raised additional capital in the first quarter, which you can see in the numbers. And so part of that was to complete the funding necessary for VIVAT. But there's still about EUR1 billion of excess capital that has been committed to Athora for other acquisitions over time. I will start and I will turn it over to Jim. I mean, I would say broadly across the board whether it be infrastructure, whether it be real estate, I mean, obviously, when the opportunity turns from more of a growth and high valuation growth environment to a more opportunistic credit-driven environment, we tend to scale our platforms, whether it be on yield where we have been doing really well on real estate anyway or even in the more opportunistic funds, we tend to shift the dial from buying equities in a traditional way to doing more so-called distressed for control or stressed. And so across the board, we are going to see opportunities and all of our platforms are going to scale in a positive way relative to kind of the other environment. But Jim, why don't you get into more specifics? Martin, do you want to grab that? I mean, generally I would say, the insurance companies continue to grow organically. You can look at the first quarter and see that. But the low rates really should pressure. It can create a lot of more strategic transactions, sales of books of business, sales of businesses, the ability to buy large chunks of liabilities as some of the other trends that I talked about earlier start to impact the industry at large. And so those people that have capital and those people that have the ability to invest add a little bit of a higher return in a appropriate risk-adjusted way. Those companies and we count our platforms among those companies will be there to be helpful and supportive of the industry in terms how the industry itself is going to restructure. Yes. So I mean I have been actually amazed. I mean I have been on just many, many Zoom calls with Asia, with States, with other geographies around the globe. And there have been a number of annual meetings that have been over video, over Zoom or other services. And like I said, we have been closing capital. The investors, other people have been where they have fundraisings and process has been continuing to close. And so the industry at large has moved very quickly online. And so I mean I would say, it hasn't really missed a beat, which is surprising to say that but at least that's my observation so far. And like I said earlier also, unlike the financial crisis where we did have a small number even for us but there was a broader number for others of LPs that said, look, if you don't have to make a capital call, don't make a capital call and we are not open for business. We really haven't seen that. Certainly, from our point of view, we are seeing like people go the other way and say, do you have co-invest? What new funds are you raising like? And I mentioned the Accord III B fund where we literally in a month or three weeks after we have spend Accord III much more quickly than we thought closed $1.5 billion. And that was a lot of incoming and that was way ahead. When we started it, we had penciled it in to take another 30 or 60 days longer and people were just moving much more quickly. So, we haven't seen the concern that you are raising has not manifested itself. And if anything, I see it sort of slightly going the other way. I think you hit them, Josh. I think the idea of higher rates any time soon, let's say, for this decade we are going to be in a very low rate environment. And there's going to be, the government were piling on a lot of debt. But I think Josh really hit the two most important points. And if I could just add. I think that question, Josh, obviously addressed it for us, but it's the other side of that coin that gets us being very thoughtful and optimistic about our landscape because many other firms, investors, companies out there are probably a bit more levered and whether it's the solutions we brought to Expedia or Cimpress this past week, many, many, many tools we have will allow us to be that provider of solution capital. So again, well, it may not be as relevant to Apollo because of our discipline and value, it's certainly relevant for many, many other swaths of the economy. Yes, Chris, for sure. So it's a point in time mark-to-market. It's the same on the negative side on the clawback or the payable side as it is on the upside. And so we determined what we think are the appropriate valuations for all the companies in the fund and the portfolio. And then we impute carry off that. And this arises because Fund VIII has made prior distributions of carry. And so at a point in time at March 31, using those unrealized marks, that would be the imputed repayment. But it reverses itself with unrealized appreciation at the same way that normal carry is sort of created and booked with appreciation. So it's symmetrical. Stay healthy."

            "content": "Great. Thanks Josh. As Leon and Josh mentioned, we have seen a tremendous response from all of our employees through this challenging environment. We quickly moved towards a fully remote work construct to ensure the health and safety of all our employees leaning heavily on our technology platform and robust operational processes. We have been very pleased with the seamless transition of our workforce to this new model of working from home, which coincided with one of the most active investing environments that Apollo has ever seen. We announced a dividend of $0.42 per share for the quarter, which is fully supported by our after-tax FRE. During the first quarter, we generated fee related earnings of $0.52 per share on a pretax basis. As Josh mentioned, this quarter underscored the strength and stability of our fee related revenues. Management fees declined by just $5 million or 1.4% during the quarter as realization activity in private equity lowered the fee paying AUM base. The modest impact to management fees resulting from credit and real asset mark-to-market adjustments was offset by capital deployment. The run rate impact on management fees of the widening and credit spreads in March is consistent with the impact we outlined at our Investor Day in November. Costs remain well-controlled, which in conjunction with durable management fees, helped support our FRE margin of 54%, in line with the prior quarter. Notably, over the last 12 months, FRE totaled $2.21 on a per share basis and grew by 8.5% on a dollar basis, driven by 10.6% growth in management fees. Turning to the incentive business. Notwithstanding the $68 million of gross realized performance fees, our pretax incentive earnings were negative for the quarter. In addition to the traditional costs associated with direct profit share interests in realized carry and financing costs associated with that debt and preferred securities, we incurred one-time costs to wind down our managed account arrangement and we funded our incentive pool with a portion of the realized performance fees. AUM declined by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $316 billion, a result of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on our portfolio, offset in part by fundraising. The impact to fee generating AUM during the quarter was more modest, a 2% decline to $242 billion, as our management fee base is largely insulated from unrealized mark-to-market movements. Having said this, on April 1, Athora closed on the acquisition of VIVAT, adding an incremental $45 billion of assets under management for the second quarter and bringing pro forma AUM at March 31 to approximately $360 billion. Of this, permanent capital vehicles amount to more than $200 billion or 57% of our total pro forma AUM. During the quarter, organic inflows continued to be healthy and in line with previous years at $7 billion, particularly in a quarter without an opportunistic flagship fundraise or a strategic platform acquisition. Flows included capital raised by Athora to fund its acquisition of VIVAT, organic growth at Athene and positive flows across a number of credit funds and managed accounts. Gross redemptions, which was 0.1% of beginning of. AUM, reflecting the largely long-dated nature of our funds' capital. These redemptions were more than offset by inflows into those same strategies. Turning to investment performance for the quarter. In private equity, price declines of 21.6% were in line with declines in the broad equity markets. Our energy exposure in private equity remains modest at just 4% of invested assets. In credit and real assets, our overall returns of minus 9% and minus 6.5% outperformed their respective market indices as a result of sector allocation decisions and careful security selection. Our balance sheet was impacted by unrealized negative marks in two respects in the quarter. First, we continue to market our investment in Athene to market, including the additional shares accumulated during the quarter under the equity swap transaction between Apollo and Athene. Since these shares are subject to sale restriction for three years, we take a further discount to the quoted market price to reflect this lock-up. The aggregate impact on our balance sheet of these components was approximately $3 per share. Second, price declines in our investment portfolios reduced our net carry receivable and created a mark-to-market obligation to return carry of $1.31 per share. Ultimately, we believe this obligation is temporary and will not be realized as we remain confident in Fund VIII and more broadly our platform's ability to generate meaningful realized returns over time. Fund VIII would require an approximate 11% appreciation in value from March 31 to remove this obligation, approximately equal to changes in the broad equity markets in April. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to make a few comments regarding liquidity across the firm and our expectations for index inclusion. Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. In addition, our dry powder position was robust at the end of the quarter at $41 billion. And as Josh discussed, we see opportunities to raise incremental capital for numerous strategies. Finally, as it relates to index inclusion, we have amended the company's charter and bylaws to reflect the change in the voting rights of our Class A shareholders. We believe these changes should make us eligible for inclusion in the Russell indices as part of their upcoming June rebalance. With that, we will now turn the call back to the operator and open the line for any of your questions. Sure. It's Martin. Yes, I will take that. Hi Craig. So as I mentioned in the comments, sensitivity that we outlined at the Investor Day to downward marks has sort of proven out to be de minimis number. Probably that's reflected in the Q1 numbers on their part because it could occurred halfway through the quarter. But as I mentioned, deployment and inflows have mitigated that downdraft. So I use the frame of reference and assumptions that you want to make around where the markets go from here to, as I mentioned, what the impact on management fees looks like. But it's entirely consistent with what was laid out. On CLOs, the structure of our CLO vehicles is such that we are not, most of our fees are protected and in base management fees, we don't have a lot of variability to performance fees in the event of the downgrades on CLOs. So I would sort of, as I mentioned, that as low single digit million dollar range for the balance of the year, even assuming there is downgrades ahead of us. And then in terms of performance revenues, it's low right now. And so, I would sort of assume the current run rate is appropriate for the foreseeable future. Sure. Yes. Bill, I will take that, sure. So let me just frame a few numbers that might help. So we have used this gross purchases, gross price data this quarter in view of the environment that we are in and also just to demonstrate the scale and the breadth of the platform and how active we have been. I view this as a supplementary disclosure this quarter to our typical deployment, which you can see in the documents, which is around $5 billion for the quarter and that's sort of run rate with what's it been. And that lower number is a narrow definition that's specific to some opportunistic drawdown funds that are the flagships. So of the $40 billion, around a third of that, as Josh mentioned, is in funds that are pursuing higher return targets. Most of that was done after the dislocation started to impact us in mid-February on. And the other two-thirds was in performing vehicles which supports the market through a volatile period. You can see the impact of all the activity in the ending fee-gen AUM. So that's the best I could point to look at. And you can also sort of triangulate that with how dry powder has changed relative to inflows over the quarter. But I would say, the $40 billion represents some repositioning. There's some sales in there. Some of that's on leverage. But it all sort of translates itself into what you can see as the fee base in the AUM tables. Yes. And I would just underscore, we use public comps extensively. Most of our book is comped against public data. And the dispersion in the marks this quarter was really wide depending on what sector, what industry vertical our portfolio companies set in. So a very volatile period. March 31 didn't catch it at the lows, but it was certainly a lot lower than it is today. And so we expect that to translate into ups. Obviously, in our private books when we go through that process at the end of this quarter as it's coming through to publish. Yes. So the clawback or the negative carry, if you like, is a mark-to-market concept and it will reverse and eliminate with an uplift in valuations. And so across the whole portfolio, we would need 11%. It so happens that the broad equity markets are also up by the same number as a guide or as a proxy up. And as Josh mentioned, our public positions are up by more. And we will see where the privates end up for the quarter once we go through that process. But 11% is what's needed to take the clawback back to zero and that takes that issue off the table. Yes. I will comment on that. It was a 10b5-1 that was filed last year and with different price points embedded within the grid. And so it took effect in the last week based on where prices were. So it was all predetermined and submitted some time back. Yes. So Gerry, that's quick one. So yes, the discount is just a term of the lockup and the volatility in the stock. So it's formulaic. It's like an option pricing model. It burns off with time, subject to where it all goes from here. So if vol was flat, you would expect to see a straight line drop off, but it will do whatever vol does between now and three years from now. I would amplify on that. I mean, why do institutions give us money? They give us money, one, for performance. And, two, they give us money because we have created a chemistry of trust and a relationship over time. We have been at this 30 years now. We have a AAA group of institutional investors. And as long as we keep performing, the world, I mean, in the last few years has broken up to the haves and have-nots. The large private equity funds that have been in business and have created this chemistry have garnered outsized percentages of the money that's out there. And there's a lot of capital out there. In an ultra-low interest rate environment, there is a lot of cash still around looking for yields, looking for returns. And so I would agree with Josh. If anything, this will continue to play to our benefit as long as we perform because we already do have 30-year relationships with the large pools of capital that exists. More specifically to Fund IX, again we are bullied. Look, I have been able to perform in good times and bad. But clearly distressed environments have played in our favor historically over the last 30 years with five downcycles. But in Fund IX, we are about a third invested. That was a $25 billion fund. So even with outsized opportunities that's probably is going to be at least 18 to 24 months before we are out fundraising again there. Yes. I think that covers it"
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Jim Zelter",
            "content": "No. I think I would just add, the evolution of the markets and capital markets and the role we play is just broader and broader. And as Josh mentioned earlier, our fundraising is going to be on dislocation strategies, capital solutions and distressed. He hit the distressed. But certainly I would say in terms of, we have been saying for a few years that the biggest risk out there was the market structure and hence the activity that we put forth on our Accord and our other drawdown vehicles in the quarter that were trigger-based. And also, as we think about our large cap origination potential platform and the success of Hybrid Value [indiscernible] through relatively newer strategies that we have developed over the last five to seven years. So we have a lot more tools in our toolbox from which to be a very active participant in the markets today. I would also like to just add something Josh said about the market not differentiating. Look, there have been many roads to Rome in terms of our industry. We have taken a much more conservative road than many of our peers. There is a real difference in playing growth and paying an average of 11 to 12 times EBITDA and levering it seven times versus what we have done in our model which is to buy companies at 6.5 times and lever them at 3.5 times. We just haven't played the same levered growth model as many others in our industry. And when a sharp correction comes like this, you have to be almost into it and obviously you have to look at it on a case-by-case method, which is what we do. But that's why when we look at our portfolio, there's only 5% of the names that we have put on our watch list. That portfolio is in very good shape. Yes. I would say that it's our view that like we saw in 2008, changing evolution, what makes our business interesting is, we can obviously invest in assets and we can also be a rescue or a variety of capital solution for a company. So to your point, there are opportunities for us to play both sides of that. And I would suspect in real estate, we have a large business in the debt side, less from the equity side. So that ability to originate, whether it's broadly more in the triple-net lease space or other areas on real estate, I think you will see us expand. We obviously put our foot in the ground about 24 months ago with the purchase of the infrastructure platform from GE. That's been very well received and the performance has been terrific. So, I think what you are going to see for us strategically expanding now is our robust model tells us that origination in a variety of areas, whether it's credit, real estate, infrastructure, we can continue to expand. And I do think that there are some things, I will give you one little nugget to think about. There certainly is going to be an impact in the CLO market with what's going on with CCC baskets. There's going to be a limitation on CLOs being a solution provider. And therefore, we think about the breadth of the $20 billion that Josh and Leon have talked about, our ability to have vehicles that can fill those cracks and fill those opportunities is really critical to our business. So yes, whenever there's a period like this of dislocation, the sands of origination change, the sands of platforms change and I suspect we will be not only providing solutions for companies and pools of assets, but also holistically which will endure too and order of the benefit of APO as the platform. I am sorry. Go ahead, Josh. Sorry. And I would add one thing. As Josh said, 2016, 2015, 2016 was about oil and Chinese growth. This is much longer lasting. And I think the theme that we have been talking about and addressing in our platform is, yes, the IG market is open. For the best companies, whether it's Boeing yesterday, massive liquidity because of the Fed programs in the IG marketplace. But in the broad economy, the asset-backed-businesses, franchise finance, SME lending, those industries and those funding vehicles are still, I don't want to say they are broken, but there's sand in the gears and there's underlying economic concerns. So when we think about the breadth of our platform and what's going on in the headlines in the last few weeks, very interesting. The Fed and Treasury and the government's done a great job. But as Josh and I are talking about, just the extensive impact, you can shut the economy down in a few days, it takes weeks, months and quarters to restart it. And it's that type of environment that we will be active in the breadth of our business. Right. And I have heard, just to underscore Leon's point, like I have heard from a lot of investors that the bigger branded players in general, the trusted players like, it's much harder now. If you don't know someone you are trying to raise a first time fund and you are trying to do the first meeting or resume or the second or third or the fifth, it's much harder. But for someone you have been in business with for many years, we are benefiting and the large branded funds are benefiting from that trend."

During today\u2019s discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode. And following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference call will be opened for questions. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone to our call this morning. Our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results reported earlier today reflect Apollo's financial results on a standalone basis, before consideration of our recent merger with Athene, which closed on January 1. That said, we will briefly touch on key highlights from Athene's results, which were issued separately this morning. In addition, we posted a financial supplement on our website, which updates our fourth quarter and full year results in our new post-merger financial construction. Beginning next quarter, this will be our primary view, including contributions from our three new segments, and will illustrate our combined earnings power. Fee-related earnings reached a quarterly record of $309 million or $0.67 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion or $2.68 per share for full year 2021. In terms of distributable earnings, we reported $1.05 of DE per share for the fourth quarter and an annual record of $4.56 per share for full year 2021, which is more than double the level we earned in 2020. Joining me this morning to discuss all the business momentum we are seeing at Apollo and our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. We look forward to addressing all your questions following the conclusion of our prepared remarks. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Thank you for spending time with us. As I often say, I'm fortunate to lead a company in an industry that gets better every day. Our industry is driven by powerful trends, demographics, generational transfer of wealth, low rates and the extreme correlation and indexification of equity and fixed income markets. I am even more fortunate to lead a company with tremendous momentum and with a unique business model in the alternatives industry. 2021 was a transformational year for Apollo. AUM is a record; fundraising, a record; modernizations, a record; origination, a record; 424 people joined our platform, another record; and turnover was the lowest it's been in a very long time. We achieved 15% year-over-year FRE growth without any sizable inorganic activity and without a flagship fund, which, as all of you know, is in the cards for 2022. As excited as I was for 2021, 2022 should be even brighter. At our very detailed Investor Day in October, we communicated a strategic vision and financial plan. In just a few short months, we have made significant progress against that plan; recall the three pillars of that plan or the three key bets as we like to say. One was the growth in our retail business and retail franchise, which I will touch on, and Jim Zelter will spend more time on, the second, origination, which is the capacity to originate investments and, therefore, continue to provide above-average rates of return per unit of risk for our clients and the third, in our Capital Markets segment. Let me take a second and just briefly touch on each of those three bets. In origination, we originated $37 billion in the fourth quarter. We're now running well over $100 billion on an annual basis. Recall why this is important, our market sometimes loses sight of what's in short supply. Capital as a general matter is plentiful, and it is assets that offer appropriate risk rewards that are in short supply. So therefore, we are incredibly focused on growing our capacity to originate, assets that offer attractive risk rewards. They are, in fact, the limiter on our growth rather than the capacity to raise money. Every attractive asset that we originate across our platform has a home in a fund, in a co-invest, on a retirement services balance sheet or through syndication. In short, it is never capital that is in short supply, it is assets, and we are micro focused on scaling origination. Platforms, which are recurring originations, are a very significant portion of our strategy. In the fourth quarter alone, we added Aqua Finance in Consumer, Petros PACE Finance in solar, Alliant Inventory Solutions in partnership with BNP, and the momentum continues. No one is doing what we are doing at the size and scale, and we've talked a lot in our industry about permanent capital. I'm much more interested in talking with you about permanent origination. In Global Wealth, as you know, we announced the acquisition of Griffin. Griffin Capital is a meaningful accelerator to wealth platform. We also made, during the quarter, strategic investments in two technology companies to facilitate the growth of our distribution businesses. CASE and ICAP are two of the leading technology platforms, helping financial advisers, access alternative strategies. Tech-enabled distribution is a must-have for anyone hoping to serve this market. We also saw early product success in the channel. Our BDC, Apollo Debt Solutions, is off to a very strong start, which Jim Zelter will take you through. I continue to believe that democratization of finance is one of the most powerful tailwinds driving our platform. If you think about our industry and us, in particular, we, in the alternatives industry, have spent better than 30 years, on the cutting edge of creating products and services, primarily for large global institutions who are not taxpayers. We have an opportunity now as a result of increasing sophistication of retail investors, increasing technology, increased democratization and legalization of opportunity and this massive generational transfer of wealth, to take that brainpower and focused on creating products and services that are bespoke for this particular channel. Early iterations of serving this channel have been very successful, but really are the first step. They are nothing more than the institutionalization of products that already exist. I view the real steps here as creating unique products and services that are designed for this channel. And given our experience with Athene, which you will hear, we have tremendous insight into what it takes at a granular level to make be successful in this channel. On Capital Solutions, again, Jim will go in more detail. Suffice it to say, 2021 revenues in Capital Solutions were up 20% year-over-year. And as you know, our plan that we've communicated is a doubling of capital solutions revenue over the next five years. Significant landmark transaction, which I know Jim will touch on in the fourth quarter, is SoftBank, which will help you imagine where we're going with Capital Solutions. Noah touched briefly on our quarterly reporting. This is the last quarter that we will report on a standalone basis with the Athene merger having closed on January 1. Athene had an awesome 2021. As good a year as Apollo had, Athene had an even better year: record profitability, earning more than $2 billion; record organic inflows, more than $37 billion of organic inflows, not only record inflows across all four of its business channels, but the returns at which this new business was underwritten, significantly exceeded the compelling mid-teens target that we have. With the merger closed and collaboration and creativity ongoing, I see nothing but upside from the combination that closed just a month ago. I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on the market. Everywhere I go, people want to understand the impact of current market trends on our business. My standard answer, if you think about the environment, we've been in for the past 10 years, purchase price has not mattered. The more risk you took, the more outrageous, generally the higher the payoff. We have seen a significant correction across equity markets as a result of revaluations. We have also seen a significant change in fixed income markets as a result of Central Bank activity. Our platform is built for purchase price matters. We have achieved amazing results over the past decade in a market that has not necessarily been kind to our strategy and where our patient value-oriented, disciplined approach to capital deployment has not been rewarded. I believe we are in the right place at the right time. I believe the 2022 fund raise for APOLLO 10, that will be very successful as we offer our large institutional clients a different approach to how to get return in a market that is -- seems to have lost a bit of the go-go spirit. Let me pivot to merger and governance, as I get ready to hand over to Jim Zelter, who is chomping at the bit to take over. The merger with Athene closed on January 1. The next chapter is very exciting, low risk of execution, as we know each other incredibly well, having worked together for the past 12, 13 years. We are adding the 1,400-person Athene team to the roughly 2,000 Apollo employees; pro forma 3,500 total employees, approximately $40 billion of market cap. In addition to the Mira merger, this was an opportunity for us to complete the governance changes that we have had hinted at and been very explicit at throughout the last year. We are one share, one vote. We are a two-thirds independent Board. We have an independent Chair. And we have all of the requisite requirements to be eligible for broad index inclusion. Now let me conclude. I often say and I started our Strategy Day by really pointing out that culture beats strategy every day. We have built an incredible culture. The marketplace understands the long-term benefit of what we are building and is helping us to win the war on talent. People are attracted to the clear strategic vision, the authentic nature of the people they meet and our cultural values. As I suggested, we added 424 employees in 2021. While very exciting, we're not likely to repeat that in 2022, having made significant progress. These are senior hires across global wealth, origination, finance, Asia Pacific. We have incredible momentum going into 2022. The team is eager to execute the plan we have articulated for you. We're excited about the next chapter and a more profitable one Apollo and ready to take the hill. Let me now turn it over to my partner, Jim Zelter.\nJim Zelter: Thanks, Marc. 2021 was indeed a banner year for Apollo, as Marc described. We remain squarely focused on driving excess returns across the spectrum, from fixed income replacement up to private equity, in order to deliver the investment alpha that our clients entrust us to provide. Our record deployment activity exemplifies our ability to source recurring transactions at scale as well as the expanding diversification of the platform. In our Private Equity business, we committed and invested more capital over the last two years than in any other period in our history, totaling $20 billion. We believe, we can deploy capital at a similar rate in 2022, especially, as Marc described, the recent market volatility persists. Additionally, our committed but unfunded pipeline ended the quarter nearly $8 billion, primarily comprised of Lumen Technologies and the Venetian transaction. Our near-term pipeline of potential transactions, remain strong with Fund IX 78% committed at the end of the first quarter, and we have approximately $5 billion of dry powder to commit before the management fees from Fund X turn on. More recently, with the rotation from growth to value over the past several months, Apollo's vision itself as a solution provider in the marketplace, providing a differentiated tool kit to our clients. The recent dislocation and heightened volatility should create attractive capital deployment opportunities across numerous investor areas of the firm. Our hybrid value funds, the credit franchise, broadly speaking, and our partnership with Motiv allow us to provide creative, flexible solutions across the capital structure for companies in need. Moving on to debt origination. Total originations surged during the fourth quarter, as Marc said, reaching $37 billion. The uptick in fourth quarter origination volume was driven by strong high-grade alpha, middle market direct lending and commercial real estate volumes. Within high-grade alpha, a strategy where we can showcase our abilities as a solution provider, we generated particularly strong activity. In one notable transaction, we completed a $4 billion loan to SoftBank, secured by their second Vision Fund. Our ability to deliver this magnitude of capital in a relatively short time frame via discrete bilateral negotiation is exactly why our clients partner with us. You should expect to hear more about these types of large-scale transactions as our platform continues to expand. Higher levels of origination volumes are also driving higher transaction fees in our Capital Solutions business. Fourth quarter and full year fees of $94 million and $298 million, respectively, reached new heights. And it's worth noting that we completed approximately 80 ACS transactions in 2021, which is double the volume we created a year prior. As Marc touched on, we announced several new origination platform investments over the past few months that will help grow our supply of recurring origination volume. Importantly, Athene funded the equity commitment in all three of these investments, as part of their normal course investment strategy, demonstrating the capital efficiency of our model. One, we announced our pending acquisition of a controlling stake in consumer lender, Aqua Finance, which will extend our access to quality consumer loans. In 2021, Aqua originated nearly $2 billion of loans in the consumer arena, which represents a double over the past three years. We also announced and closed our acquisition of Petros PACE Finance, a platform that provides significant deployment opportunity for Apollo and Athene to support clean energy real estate transactions. PACE has originated over $700 million in long-term fixed rate financing since 2016, and we expect rapid growth in that sector as the market expands and we confront sustainable construction and regulatory climate mandates. Finally, an important transaction was our strategic announcement with BNP Paribas to create Eliant inventory solutions. Eliant provides domestic and multinational companies with strategic and responsive inventory capital solutions to better optimize their supply chain and balance sheets. Backed by strong client demand at launch, we expect the platform to generate a multibillion-dollar level of annual flows beginning this year. These three platforms really are great examples of our broader fixed income replacement vision at work. While we are excited about the progress we've already achieved to broaden our origination, there is still significant runway to scale our existing platforms and fill in additional growth white space. At the macro level, we believe the evolving interest rate backup will create tactical opportunities to position our client portfolios into more favorable higher-yielding assets. As the market confronts a potentially higher rate environment, financial conditions are indeed tightening and risk premiums are increasing. For the last several years, there have been many -- there have been concerned about our ability to generate attractive returns in a perpetually low-rate environment. However, we always found ways to be successful and leaned into origination, and now we have an expansive ecosystem ready to capitalize on a market with potentially higher rates and certainly higher risk premiums. As we've said before, the fixed income replacement trend is just getting started, and we are certainly well positioned regardless of the rate environment. Moving on to monetization activity. We had another strong year of realizations, totaling $4 billion, including more than $3 billion from our Private Equity platform. For the full year, Private Equity realizations reached an annual record of $19 billion, as Fund VIII and increasingly Fund IX are in harvesting mode. Looking forward, we expect our realization super cycle to continue. That said, if the current market correction persists, some of our planned term realizations may be pushed out to later in the year. Turning to investment performance. We had a strong year of performance across our entire franchise. Our Private Equity portfolio appreciated 48% in 2021, outperforming the S&P by over 20%. And additionally, our flagship fund performance remains exceptional, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 48% and 30% net. And I'll mention, Fund IX's portfolio is still relatively young, and we believe there is a lot of embedded value still to come. Our inaugural hybrid value fund continues to perform very well, generating a growth of 29% and 23% net. And in credit, our portfolio saw 1.6% of gross appreciation in the fourth quarter and more than 10% for the full year. Finally, our structured credit debt origination strategies had particularly strong performance, both outperforming their respective benchmarks by a remarkable 1,100 basis points in 2021. In terms of capital raising, total inflows of $24 billion in the fourth quarter were strong, bringing full year inflows to $67 billion. As Marc mentioned, we raised a record amount of capital from third-party clients in a non-flagship fundraising year with $23 billion of total inflows. Athene added $37 billion of inflows, including 9 in the fourth quarter alone. Third-party fundraising in the fourth quarter totaled $8 billion, increasing from $5 billion average pace through the third quarter. And fourth quarter fundraising included healthy inflows from Accord plus EPF IV, and our second infrastructure fund, which held its final close in the quarter. Importantly, we launched the fundraising for Fund X in January and are encouraged by the early reception. We feel confident in raising our targeted $25 billion in capital and think our differentiated investment strategy, grounded in value while embracing innovation resonates, particularly well in this current market backdrop. We successfully launched our nonlisted credit BDC, Apollo Debt Solutions, in November with a single platform in Asia and Europe, and expanded distribution to the domestic platform in the beginning of January. Early reception of our marketing efforts have been extremely positive, and we raised over $1 billion of equity proceeds to date since product launched two months ago. When our exclusivity period ends in March, we will broaden distribution to other wire houses, several RIAs and at the independent broker-dealer channel via our strategic distribution partnerships. Additionally, we've invested heavily in product development and are currently working on several other funds tailored for the mass-affluent market. In December, we did announce the agreement to acquire Griffin, which is strategically important in our accelerating our multipronged five-year global wealth strategy. A year ago, we were more limited in our global wealth capabilities, but with the launch of ADS as well as Griffin, we now have proof of concept on product and distribution capability. When Griffin closes, which is expected to occur in the first half of this year, we will have roughly 130 people working across the platform. With Griffin specifically, we expect to broaden our reach in the US wealth market and independent broker-dealers, providing us with new foothold in that channel. We're continuing to add the resources and capabilities across various retail distribution channels in conjunction with the Griffin team. In terms of our outlook for 2022, we feel comfortable meeting or exceeding our $80 billion organic inflow target that we communicated in the fall. We are seeing a robust pipeline in Athene and momentum across third-party fundraising initiatives, including a strong start at ADS, as I've previously mentioned; and incremental Griffin -- flow at Griffin gives us great comfort. Looking back to 2021, we couldn't be more excited about the evolution of the franchise. We continue to expand the dialogue with our global investor base and continue to provide solutions to companies seeking to raise capital. We have leading returns in flagship Private Equity. We've launched nascent strategies with strong early performance and client traction, including hybrid value in the infrastructure equity business. Our yield platform is expanding along with the continued build-out of our front-end origination platforms. We're syndicating more dollars alongside a growing capital solutions business, and we're seeing increased demand for our third-party retirement services. We are excited to demonstrate meaningful progress against our goals, which we laid out in the fall. With that, I'll turn it over to my partner, Martin, who will discuss our financial results.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll provide a brief overview of our standalone results and then bridge to our 2022 outlook for the combined businesses. Our full year after-tax DE of $2 billion was very strong and roughly doubled from 2020 levels, as Noah mentioned, driven by a sizable step-up in PE realization activity and mid-teens FRE growth. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year, which included more than 20% growth in our credit real assets businesses and transaction fees were up 19% year-over-year, while fee-related expenses grew 19%, reflecting our comp and non-comp-driven investment for growth. Our full year FRE margin of 54% was in line with our expectations. In mid-January, we filed a financial supplement containing historical information for our new post-merger segment reporting. And in late January, we filed an 8-K outlining merger-related updates and certain financial items. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will report results for three operating segments: asset management, retirement services and principal investing, with fee-related earnings, FRE; spread-related earnings, SRE; and principal investing income, PII, as their primary performance metrics looking forward. Strong results by Apollo and Athene in 2021 provide us with momentum as we head into 2022, positioning us well to achieve our five-year targets. As previously communicated, we expect after-tax DE of approximately $3.3 billion or $5.50 per share in 2022. We expect approximately 90% of these earnings to be comprised of highly stable and recurring FRE and SRE. In our Asset Management segment, we expect the following trends to drive our FRE in the year ahead. Fee-related revenues should see attractive growth in 2022, with management fee growth around the mid to high-teens level, and our plan suggests transaction fees growing at a faster pace than they did in 2021. In terms of fee-related expenses, as you know, we have been making significant investments in talent and infrastructure to drive higher FRE growth and capture the next significant leg of growth we believe is attainable. We've made many great additions across our platform and continued to attract high-caliber individuals. We are managing this growth in the context of the glide path we've laid out, which is for our comp ratio to start moving from roughly 30% toward our longer-term target of 25% over the next five years. On the non-comp side, we are in the midst of rebasing in 2022 as we absorb the infrastructure costs, including technology and occupancy of supporting our larger team. Putting the pieces together, we expect an FRE margin of approximately 54% to 55% in 2022, putting us on a path higher towards our 60% plus goal by 2026. We expect this will drive at least $1.4 billion of pre-tax FRE in 2022, or $2.35 per share. In our Retirement Services segment, we are on track to deliver our 2022 objectives outlined at our Investor Day. We expect low double-digit growth in net invested assets, driven by the healthy organic growth expectations that Jim mentioned. From these assets, less fully loaded funding costs and overhead, we expect the segment to generate a net spread of approximately 110 to 115 basis points. This spread translates to pre-tax SRE in excess of $2 billion in 2022 or approximately $3.35 per share. Embedded within this earnings profile is an expectation for a normalized return on Athene's alternative investments of approximately 10%, following a particularly strong return in 2021, amidst a robust market backdrop. In our Principal Investing segment, we believe we have a favorable tailwind at our back from having two, flagship Private Equity funds in harvesting mode. So as Jim mentioned earlier, the timing of realization can be impacted if the market correction persists. Our best expectation for the income contribution in PII heading into a new year is to align around our forecast over a multiyear horizon. This equates to approximately $500 million of pre-tax income or $0.80 per share on average over the next five years. You should think of us as net beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. Jim mentioned the opportunities created by a higher-rate environment, which we believe will benefit FRE. The only part of our revenue that is susceptible to a decline from rising rates, are management fees earned from net asset value rather than committed or invested capital. Historically, the most notable pool of assets with this basis was Athene's fixed income assets. Following a recently agreed-upon adjustment to the investment management agreement with Athene, our basis for earning management fees will now be book value for the vast majority of Athene's assets. This change will serve to mitigate management fee volatility from changes in rates or spreads. Further, with regard to potential SRE impacts from rising rates, approximately 20% of Athene's portfolio is in floating rate securities. While there are some offsets, we would expect a 25 basis point parallel shift up in the curve to drive an incremental $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE, representing low single-digit accretion on distributable earnings. Turning to capital allocation, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital for investment over the next five years as we discussed at our Investor Day, which is illustratively earmarked as $5 billion of capital to fund our expected annual base dividend of $1.60 per share, $5 billion of capital for dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases and another $5 billion of growth capital. The impact of the latter $10 billion is not reflected in our base targets. While we will evaluate opportunities on a case-by-case basis, we will most likely look to deploy the majority of the growth capital towards strategic ventures in the near-term that will accelerate FRE growth. We declared a dividend of $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter and have allocated approximately $1 billion to fund the annual dividend under this policy in 2022. In conjunction with the merger close, we announced a $1.5 billion opportunistic buyback authorization, along with another $1 billion for equity immunization. This new repurchase program provides additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders and drive accretion on an open-ended basis. We intend to prioritize strategic growth investments given the pipeline we see, many of which we expect will drive additional growth in fee-related earnings above and beyond our base plan, recent examples of iCapital Chase and incremental equity investment in Athora and our all-stock acquisition of Griffin. To conclude and punctuate our overall message this morning, our business is firing on all cylinders. Our fundamental business drivers are reaching record levels, and we're making huge strides in pursuit of our strategic goals. We had a very busy and successful 2021, and we're well positioned to execute on our clear strategic vision and deliver results for our shareholders and clients. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nQ - Glenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. Just a quick clarifier for -- first, did you say FRE of at least $1.4 billion, this is like 17% growth in 2022? I just want to make sure I heard right.\nMarc Rowan: That's right, Glen. Yeah, $1.4 billion, which is $2.35 per share.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Cool. I guess a lot of people are asking on insurance, so let's start there. I guess it's a twofold, and it has to do with S&P and regulation. So S&P is considering changing some of its capital rules, specifically for A and lower-rated securities and structures. So what impact would that have on the excess capital position you've been talking about at Athene? And then my as well, while we're talking insurance, to talk about any changes that you think might be brewing in terms of private equity ownership of life insurance, and whether or not there are changes coming. So I appreciate the twofold question.\nMarc Rowan: Great. Well, it's Marc. Why don't I take a shot at that, Glenn? So recall that in the last year, S&P has upgraded us to A+. And we hold substantially more capital than, I think, anyone else in the industry in terms of excess capital and reduce leverage. S&P, we also hold, as you know, primarily an investment-grade portfolio. S&P is now going through a process to update its model for the first time in 10 years. There's a lot of back and forth in an active dialogue. I think it's early to know whether there will be changes to the amount of excess capital. As a personal matter, it does not concern me. At the end of the day, we operate in an industry that is devoid of excess capital. We have been among the few. I mean, if you look at capital raised across the world, US and Europe, at least, we've raised most of the capital in the insurance industry for the past decade. Anything that puts pressure on capitalization, we tend to be in [Technical Difficulty]. Having said that, I don't expect much to come out of the S&P, but it's early days. As it relates to Private Equity in insurance, what's interesting is this is a journey we've been on for 12-plus years. We have paid an immense amount of tuition. And others who are interested in following what we do will quickly find out that this is not a trade. This is a lifestyle. And you have to build the infrastructure, capable navigating that you operate in a regulated business. But let's face it. All asset management business is a regulated business. We have a decade-plus of experience in working with regulators. Capital coming to the industry is generally a positive. Capital coming out of funds that have limited lives for a long-term asset is not generally viewed as a positive. New players coming to the business who understand that the primary risk, to putting risk on insurance company balance sheet through increased exposure to subordinated securities, are going to find out that that is not really going to be accepted broadly across the industry. What Jim articulated as fixed income replacement, which is maintaining the credit quality of the business while trying to earn excess spread, I believe, is the right strategy, certainly for us and probably for many others. But, I expect a lot of fits and starts on behalf of third parties as they try and figure it out.\nGlenn Schorr: I\u2019ll sure left for the next time. Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Glenn. I\u2019m sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is now open.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. So maybe, Marc, one for you. One of the questions we're coming up against with the flattening of the forward curve expectations and credit spreads starting to widen out a tad. The natural question is sort of potential for a credit cycle. So, I was wondering if you could sort of, address how you think you're positioned for that. What would be the pros and cons? And then for Martin, just a clarification. It sounds like you're at 5.70 for base earnings ex PAI. Is that -- did I hear that correctly? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: So, Jim and I will tag team on credit. I'll start by pointing out that. Look we've been in a decade-long period where taking risk has been rewarded. And I didn't just mean my comments for equity. I meant for credit as well. We, as a firm have generally not saw to position our portfolio that way. We have almost always been senior secured. And the way we have earned excess return is through origination or taking some amount of liquidity risk rather than subordination risk, credit risk or duration risk. I believe we are well positioned in the portfolio for widening of rates and for credit cycle. And I don't want to belabor it, because I think Jim lives this every day. So, I'm going to flip it over to Jim to follow-up.\nJim Zelter: Yes. I would just highlight, when we go through these origination platforms and people, really -- they still ask us what do you mean by fixing replacement. When we think about the Wheels, Donlen platform that we aggregate over the last 12 months, this is a company that's been around for 50 years, and it's been time-tested through the cycle with virtually negligible defaults. And they really are a large-scale auto fleet-finance business for many, many named consumer brand companies. Likewise, our inventory finance partnership with BNP, this is just providing capital where, in the past, investors had not had access to it. These were stuck on bank balance sheets. So when you talk about -- listen, we're students of the high yield and loan and leveraged loan in distressed markets. We are one of the preeminent players in the world. There probably would be some spread widening in those businesses, but that is not what's on the Athene and regulated balance sheets. We've been a pristine investor in those areas, and the performance in terms of the low defaults would really reflect that positioning.\nMarc Rowan: Yes. And Bill, the quick answer is yes. The numbers we're underlying today are consistent with Investor Day. We're on track. We're fully in line with what we laid out in October. So it's the numbers, 2.35, 3.35 on a pretax basis.\nBill Katz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. You just -- first, if I could just start off on the spread-related business in terms of that rate sensitivity. If we do, maybe just some perspective of whether that sensitivity is linear on the 25 basis points. And if the Fed tightened much more aggressively this year, maybe just some thoughts on the cadence of how that would run through that P&L and then into next year, say, if we have, let's say, six hikes or something like that?\nMarc Rowan: Yes, yes. Brian, it's pretty much linear. So, there's some floaters with floors, but we're above the floor. So think of it as 25, now 100 is four times 25 on that rate sensitivity. And in terms of how quickly that pulls through into earnings, about half of that is in three-month LIBOR and the other half is split between shorter and longer, one model and six equivalents.\nBrian Bedell: And then just, how many rate hikes are in your assumption for the -- for your '22 guidance on SRE?\nMartin Kelly: We don't think about it. We think about the forward curve from where it is right now, but we're not -- we don't run our business with a view of three hikes versus six versus seven. That's for macro investors, but we're a day-to-day. We've had a floating and experience for floating rate exposure around the size for the last several years. And it's just -- as I will remind you, we're duration mass on the overall assets and liabilities. So, we're not taking rate bets, but we have a natural hedge because of our floating rate exposure.\nBrian Bedell: Got it. Okay. That's good. And then just maybe on the retail strategy with Griffin. If you could talk about -- after you closed that and we get into later this year and then next year, just talk about the integration, whether you're running your retail -- you're thinking of running your retail strategy mostly through that entity or rather, are they going to be more integrated into the Apollo retail wealth distribution platform? And any insight on, where you think a sort of your percentage of fundraising could come from the retail side?\nMartin Kelly: Sure. As we've said, when we made the announcement, Griffin will be fully absorbed into Apollo. We have 100% acceptance rate of all the individuals who we brought on. In Investor Day, we laid out a five-year plan to have almost one-third of our fundraising be out of that channel. And certainly, what this does in aggregate is probably bringing our plan for a good 18, maybe even 24 months. I will also add, that has not gotten much notice along with the distribution, we're taking on a $5 billion real asset vehicle that has a long established track record and a more nascent credit product for the independent channel as well. So, people have that really brought those up, but certainly, those were benefits. What we're finding is, it's not just about having individuals, but it's the hundreds of selling agreements, the compliance agreements. The marketing infrastructure of launching and announcing a new fund, which they have 20 years of track record in doing so. So, we're extremely excited. We think it puts us -- when we think about where we were 12 to 18 months ago, it's a massive acceleration. We were very clear in our November meeting, our October meeting about what our objectives were, and we've really checked that off. I would ask, the next question is going to be, so where are you going with products? And Marc laid it out, but I think it's really important philosophically, what most folks are doing today is really repackaging the institutional products for the global wealth channel. And we're certainly going to do that. We have a track record and a brand across our platform in all of our areas, equity, hybrid and credit to allow us to be a very formidable competitor, which you're also going to see. And what Marc really touched on, which we're excited about and really plays across our platform, is the whole tax efficiency of these products. It's early days. But there really has been nothing done when one thinks about a lot of these products for high net worth individuals, there's not a great tax efficiency, especially in yield products. So we're excited about when we think about the intellectual capital of bringing Athene and their distribution and their product packaging, along with Apollo and doing it in an integrated fashion, which is happening today. We think the future is very bright to apply that.\nQ \u2013 Brian Bedell: That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nMichael Cyprys: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just continuing with the retail theme. I was hoping we could dig in a little bit more on the new private BDC that you guys launched. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how different or similar it is from an existing BDC that you guys have had for some new years that is publicly listed. I guess to what degree is there any sort of overlap with folks that are overseeing the BDC that you've had in terms of investment professionals? Maybe you could talk about the investment strategy, how it differs. And how big of an opportunity could this be with the new private BDC that you guys have? How big could that get?\nMartin Kelly: Well, Mike, we've been very clear in the last three years about large-cap direct origination. We were very vocal about it in 2019 and 2020. And certainly, with the advent of COVID, it's allowed us to do it. And as we said, I think at Investor Day, we talked about the multiple of billion-dollar commitments we made, in 2019, a handful; in 2020, about 20; and then the last year, more than 30. But to answer your specific question, the credit universe is a wide spectrum.  Our traditional business, as you know, we have mid-cap, a tremendous historic middle-market lender, the sponsor community. And that really is what our AINV strategy is doing today, a tremendous amount of overlap by that team. We also run our credit business in an integrated front-end fashion. And as we do so, we've been very focused on saying that ADS is really going to primarily focus on large-cap sponsor origination and large-cap corporate origination. So we think it's best not to operate in a silo, to run as an integrated toolbox across all the things that we offer sponsors, large and small, as well as not only leveraged finance loans, but all the other tools in the toolbox, whether it's fund finance, GP finance or otherwise. So to answer your question, we've been very clear, it's a large-cap strategy of ADS. We think very -- we think that's the way to go in terms of the future of the market and what's happening in terms of the dispersion and disruption of the syndicated market, and it works hand-in-hand in integrated fashion with our AINV and team.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Finian O'Shea from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. \nFinian O'Shea: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about the opportunity for platform acquisition, such as Aqua and PACE this quarter? How -- for one, how attractive is that category versus other components of high-grade alpha in the context of what you have to pay up for it? And how much of that stuff is still out there for you to continue to grow into through acquisition?\nMarc Rowan: It's Marc, and I'll take a shot at it, and then Jim will fill in where I miss. Think of origination as having three parts to it. One part calling effort, calling on large companies, the scale of our ecosystem. Remember, we have the largest private credit platform in the world, at least that I'm aware of, more than $350 billion. We have an incredible ecosystem. So we call on companies. And you've seen the results of that coming out of the things we've done with ADNOC, with Hertz and with so and so. The second part of it is a -- just by being such a large ecosystem and capital market participant, we benefit from capital markets-originated flows, think of SoftBank as something coming to us as a result of capital markets. The third is the notion of platforms. Platforms are companies that, in and of themselves, are attractive investments, but the business they pursue is the origination of credit, Wheels, Donlen and so on and so. So I believe we are still early days in the platform acquisition business. We have made significant inroads in fleet finance and aircraft finance, in senior secured middle-market finance, in inventory, in franchise fees and a number of other areas. And I think what you will see is, yes, we will continue to go into new areas. But I think what you're going to see is the existing platforms get scale. Just like Donlen and Wheels came together, I think you will see us this year, in particular, add scale to what we do. The resource commitment that we have in our internal FIG group, I predict our FIG and Strategy Group will be the size of our Private Equity group over the next few years. This is a full-court press, a full-time effort. Origination and recurring origination is among the most valuable things that we do. One last footnote on it. When we buy an origination platform, the we is generally Athene, Thora and our institutional limited-partner clients. They like in buying an origination because this is a perpetual machine that generally produces relatively safe low-teens recurring rates of return. It in some ways, it is a perfect alternative for large sovereign funds and for large retirement services balance sheets. But it is a two-fold, not only do we get an attractive alternative equity investment, which generally is funded, as I suggested, out of the Retirement Services balance sheet and a limited partner capital, we also get origination. Some of that origination is absorbed internally in Retirement Services balance sheets and credit funds, and some of it goes external through our capital markets and syndication business. This is a significant feeder to our ecosystem. Every day, the reinforcement of the ecosystem gets better and better through these platforms.\nFinian O'Shea: Thank you. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, if I may. I'm sorry if I missed this. Can you talk about the trade-off on the Athene fixed income mark-to-market fee arrangements? Did you have to take a concession on the fee for that exchange?\nJim Zelter: No. No. We've fixed it going through the close of the year. There's no impact.\nFinian O'Shea: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert A. Lee from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.\nRobert A. Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Just wanted to maybe ask on Athora a bit, I mean, I know you feel very good about the long-term opportunity there, but it feels like it's been pretty quiet since last year or so. I know that you wanted to kind of put that platform in the order once you acquire that big block of business. But what are your thoughts heading into 2022? Should we be thinking that, that business there's increased potential for more transactions coming out of Europe on that platform, now that you've you spent this past year maybe investing in it? So, just wanted to get some update there.\nMarc Rowan: Great. Robert, its Marc, I'll take a shot at this. I like your definition of quiet. The team in the room that works on Athora said, they'd like to understand what busy is then. So if you think about what's happened to Athora over the reasonable period of time, we obviously did a very large transaction in the Netherlands for VIVAT, adding some \u20ac40 billion to the balance sheet. We also did add-ons in Belgium, and we did a de novo in Italy this year, so another \u20ac8 million to \u20ac10 billion. That seemed like plenty, for the year. We are, as you suggested, absorbing. 2021 has been a year of absorbing. You should expect us to do a sizable capital raise at Athora at some point during the year. Apollo led that off with a \u20ac250 million upsize in a safe, pending the future capital raise. What we're also starting to see is, people turning themselves to new business. Very often what happens in -- particularly in something like the Netherlands, is it takes a while to understand exactly what the opportunity is on a go-forward basis. And so we've started to see the equivalent of a pension risk transfer market really developed in Europe. In terms of what's going to happen in Europe this year, I believe it will be an incredibly active year. All indications tell me that there will be sizable blocks of business that change hands. The pickup in rates, in some ways, is actually helpful in reducing the embedded loss of a lot of these historic books of business to the legacy companies. So in short, I thought 2021 was very active, but I expect 2022 to be even more active, on a go-forward basis. And I'll make one final point. Whatever tuition needed to be paid in the U.S. over more than a decade, this is advanced chemistry. It is a much more complicated market. Solvency II is a much more complicated regime to operate in. Being able to speak both languages, RBC and Solvency II, is a huge advantage. You're seeing it. Japan is moving towards Solvency II, Hong Kong and the rest of Asia, moving towards Solvency II. And you've seen us across the platform, not just in Athora, but also in Athene, be able to take the skill set of understanding how a Solvency II balance sheet works and do the first couple of reinsurance transactions in Japan for Athene. So I expect this to continue to be a very active area. And more than you want to know, but the commoditization of publicly traded fixed income and the inability of traditional market participants to earn excess return in fixed income is the driver that is pushing the disposition of these blocks of business. And I think this is going to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Blostein: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So first, Marc, maybe just a clarification on the change in management fee concession with Athene is going from market value to book value, what's the impact relative to the Q4 level? So maybe just kind of help us level-set what the Athene management fee to Apollo was in the fourth quarter under kind of the new methodology and the old methodology. And then when it comes to macro moves broadly, kind of heard your comments obviously around rising interest rates on SRE, but how should we think about sensitivity to wide-grade spreads within SRE as well?\nMarc Rowan: So Alex, there is no impact. There's no day one impact to the change in the fee basis. And as we go through purchase accounting and the PCAOB process, book value converges to market value at day one. So they -- the book value sort of becomes market value and resets in new basis going forward. And so it's the same asset value that you're using to reference the fee rate. And there's no other adjustments to the contract. So that's pretty clean, I think, and straightforward. And on the spread duration and the spread risk, I would think of that as having a similar profile to credit -- to rates. But obviously, it depends on turnover in the portfolio, rates reset every month, every quarter. Spreads reset as you buy and sell security. So it's kind of more prolonged impact on the pull-through.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. All right. Thanks for clarification. Bigger-picture question on fundraising. You guys sound pretty excited about 2022, $80 billion plus. Can you help break down what the latest assumptions are for maybe Fund X.? And then, Jim, to your point around potential upside to that $80 billion number, where do you guys see the areas of potential upside?\nJim Zelter: Well, I mean, I think we've been pretty clear over the last several months that we've been out in front with Fund X flagship, $25 billion. And Scott and the team are focused on that as the number one priority, but we have a variety of other institutional products between yield. And hybrid EPF is out there right now. Accord plus is out there right now. And so we're excited by the breadth of that. And certainly, when we think about what global wealth can do this year, we look at that contributing. In the past, it was sub-5% to 10%. And I think you're going to see in a number north of $5 billion or $6 billion on the global wealth part in addition. So we've got a lot of cylinders humming in the fundraising. And as we said, a $23 billion in 2021, ex the flagship, that's what gives us great comfort and confidence. Especially, I would add, what's really going on here for us, I know there's a tremendous amount of questions about rates in the curve, which are all critical to us. But what it really means for us it's the repricing of equity risk premium. And as Marc talked about, we've been in a decade where price didn't matter. And for us, as our strategy, all of this volatility in repricing risk premium, this is front and center of benefit of how we run our PE business. We're the classic leader in that global business in that field when there's market dispersion, hybrid value, tremendous product in that area as well. So, we feel very, very comfortable with it. If the macro moves, like we believe there will be more stock dispersion and what you've seen happen in certain growth areas, we just feel like that really plays right into our strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.\nRufus Hone: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about retirement services. And I was hoping you could discuss your thoughts around where you think the ROE of Athene can get to over time, and particularly as you bring on more third party capital and as you get the tailwind of higher interest rates feeding through to higher on the margin spreads. Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: I'll take a shot at it. It's Marc. So, for the -- from inception, Athene produced about a 17.7% return on book value. We continue to underwrite business, and we underwrote business in 2021 at north of 15% cash-on-cash. Our target in retirement services is that mid-teens rate of return on a sustainable basis. And we really -- rates themselves don't really matter. And I'm not convinced spreads matter, because the market adjusts to the pricing of new liabilities get added in the context of a competitive market. The ability to source assets is the primary driver of the growth and profitability of Retirement Services. And so, what we have done is we have, as you've been hearing for this call, made a massive bet over many years on origination that you're seeing that come to fruition and the kind of origination that benefits retirement services balance sheets. By going to third parties and opening up to third parties, that is a win-win on both sides. We also run a prudent diversified book. And we have absolutely no problem syndicating to other insurers, to other money managers and to other clients. For us, we get more flow, we get more diversification, we continue to build our ecosystem, and we get plenty of product to satisfy the internal needs from Athene and from Athora and from the various credit funds. On the other hand, if you're a client, you have the opportunity to invest side-by-side with us in an aligned fashion as where we're a principal, not just a broker, not an asset manager. Alignment is an unbelievably powerful tool in this particular area, and I think we're seeing the benefits of that.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing remarks.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thank you. Really appreciate everyone's interest in Apollo this morning and participating in our call. If you have any questions on anything we discuss on the call, please feel free to reach out to us. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll provide a brief overview of our standalone results and then bridge to our 2022 outlook for the combined businesses. Our full year after-tax DE of $2 billion was very strong and roughly doubled from 2020 levels, as Noah mentioned, driven by a sizable step-up in PE realization activity and mid-teens FRE growth. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year, which included more than 20% growth in our credit real assets businesses and transaction fees were up 19% year-over-year, while fee-related expenses grew 19%, reflecting our comp and non-comp-driven investment for growth. Our full year FRE margin of 54% was in line with our expectations. In mid-January, we filed a financial supplement containing historical information for our new post-merger segment reporting. And in late January, we filed an 8-K outlining merger-related updates and certain financial items. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will report results for three operating segments: asset management, retirement services and principal investing, with fee-related earnings, FRE; spread-related earnings, SRE; and principal investing income, PII, as their primary performance metrics looking forward. Strong results by Apollo and Athene in 2021 provide us with momentum as we head into 2022, positioning us well to achieve our five-year targets. As previously communicated, we expect after-tax DE of approximately $3.3 billion or $5.50 per share in 2022. We expect approximately 90% of these earnings to be comprised of highly stable and recurring FRE and SRE. In our Asset Management segment, we expect the following trends to drive our FRE in the year ahead. Fee-related revenues should see attractive growth in 2022, with management fee growth around the mid to high-teens level, and our plan suggests transaction fees growing at a faster pace than they did in 2021. In terms of fee-related expenses, as you know, we have been making significant investments in talent and infrastructure to drive higher FRE growth and capture the next significant leg of growth we believe is attainable. We've made many great additions across our platform and continued to attract high-caliber individuals. We are managing this growth in the context of the glide path we've laid out, which is for our comp ratio to start moving from roughly 30% toward our longer-term target of 25% over the next five years. On the non-comp side, we are in the midst of rebasing in 2022 as we absorb the infrastructure costs, including technology and occupancy of supporting our larger team. Putting the pieces together, we expect an FRE margin of approximately 54% to 55% in 2022, putting us on a path higher towards our 60% plus goal by 2026. We expect this will drive at least $1.4 billion of pre-tax FRE in 2022, or $2.35 per share. In our Retirement Services segment, we are on track to deliver our 2022 objectives outlined at our Investor Day. We expect low double-digit growth in net invested assets, driven by the healthy organic growth expectations that Jim mentioned. From these assets, less fully loaded funding costs and overhead, we expect the segment to generate a net spread of approximately 110 to 115 basis points. This spread translates to pre-tax SRE in excess of $2 billion in 2022 or approximately $3.35 per share. Embedded within this earnings profile is an expectation for a normalized return on Athene's alternative investments of approximately 10%, following a particularly strong return in 2021, amidst a robust market backdrop. In our Principal Investing segment, we believe we have a favorable tailwind at our back from having two, flagship Private Equity funds in harvesting mode. So as Jim mentioned earlier, the timing of realization can be impacted if the market correction persists. Our best expectation for the income contribution in PII heading into a new year is to align around our forecast over a multiyear horizon. This equates to approximately $500 million of pre-tax income or $0.80 per share on average over the next five years. You should think of us as net beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. Jim mentioned the opportunities created by a higher-rate environment, which we believe will benefit FRE. The only part of our revenue that is susceptible to a decline from rising rates, are management fees earned from net asset value rather than committed or invested capital. Historically, the most notable pool of assets with this basis was Athene's fixed income assets. Following a recently agreed-upon adjustment to the investment management agreement with Athene, our basis for earning management fees will now be book value for the vast majority of Athene's assets. This change will serve to mitigate management fee volatility from changes in rates or spreads. Further, with regard to potential SRE impacts from rising rates, approximately 20% of Athene's portfolio is in floating rate securities. While there are some offsets, we would expect a 25 basis point parallel shift up in the curve to drive an incremental $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE, representing low single-digit accretion on distributable earnings. Turning to capital allocation, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital for investment over the next five years as we discussed at our Investor Day, which is illustratively earmarked as $5 billion of capital to fund our expected annual base dividend of $1.60 per share, $5 billion of capital for dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases and another $5 billion of growth capital. The impact of the latter $10 billion is not reflected in our base targets. While we will evaluate opportunities on a case-by-case basis, we will most likely look to deploy the majority of the growth capital towards strategic ventures in the near-term that will accelerate FRE growth. We declared a dividend of $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter and have allocated approximately $1 billion to fund the annual dividend under this policy in 2022. In conjunction with the merger close, we announced a $1.5 billion opportunistic buyback authorization, along with another $1 billion for equity immunization. This new repurchase program provides additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders and drive accretion on an open-ended basis. We intend to prioritize strategic growth investments given the pipeline we see, many of which we expect will drive additional growth in fee-related earnings above and beyond our base plan, recent examples of iCapital Chase and incremental equity investment in Athora and our all-stock acquisition of Griffin. To conclude and punctuate our overall message this morning, our business is firing on all cylinders. Our fundamental business drivers are reaching record levels, and we're making huge strides in pursuit of our strategic goals. We had a very busy and successful 2021, and we're well positioned to execute on our clear strategic vision and deliver results for our shareholders and clients. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions. We don't think about it. We think about the forward curve from where it is right now, but we're not -- we don't run our business with a view of three hikes versus six versus seven. That's for macro investors, but we're a day-to-day. We've had a floating and experience for floating rate exposure around the size for the last several years. And it's just -- as I will remind you, we're duration mass on the overall assets and liabilities. So, we're not taking rate bets, but we have a natural hedge because of our floating rate exposure. Sure. As we've said, when we made the announcement, Griffin will be fully absorbed into Apollo. We have 100% acceptance rate of all the individuals who we brought on. In Investor Day, we laid out a five-year plan to have almost one-third of our fundraising be out of that channel. And certainly, what this does in aggregate is probably bringing our plan for a good 18, maybe even 24 months.

We remain squarely focused on driving excess returns across the spectrum, from fixed income replacement up to private equity, in order to deliver the investment alpha that our clients entrust us to provide. Our record deployment activity exemplifies our ability to source recurring transactions at scale as well as the expanding diversification of the platform. In our Private Equity business, we committed and invested more capital over the last two years than in any other period in our history, totaling $20 billion. We believe, we can deploy capital at a similar rate in 2022, especially, as Marc described, the recent market volatility persists. Additionally, our committed but unfunded pipeline ended the quarter nearly $8 billion, primarily comprised of Lumen Technologies and the Venetian transaction. Our near-term pipeline of potential transactions, remain strong with Fund IX 78% committed at the end of the first quarter, and we have approximately $5 billion of dry powder to commit before the management fees from Fund X turn on. More recently, with the rotation from growth to value over the past several months, Apollo's vision itself as a solution provider in the marketplace, providing a differentiated tool kit to our clients. The recent dislocation and heightened volatility should create attractive capital deployment opportunities across numerous investor areas of the firm. Our hybrid value funds, the credit franchise, broadly speaking, and our partnership with Motiv allow us to provide creative, flexible solutions across the capital structure for companies in need. Moving on to debt origination. Total originations surged during the fourth quarter, as Marc said, reaching $37 billion. The uptick in fourth quarter origination volume was driven by strong high-grade alpha, middle market direct lending and commercial real estate volumes. Within high-grade alpha, a strategy where we can showcase our abilities as a solution provider, we generated particularly strong activity. In one notable transaction, we completed a $4 billion loan to SoftBank, secured by their second Vision Fund. Our ability to deliver this magnitude of capital in a relatively short time frame via discrete bilateral negotiation is exactly why our clients partner with us. You should expect to hear more about these types of large-scale transactions as our platform continues to expand. Higher levels of origination volumes are also driving higher transaction fees in our Capital Solutions business. Fourth quarter and full year fees of $94 million and $298 million, respectively, reached new heights. And it's worth noting that we completed approximately 80 ACS transactions in 2021, which is double the volume we created a year prior. As Marc touched on, we announced several new origination platform investments over the past few months that will help grow our supply of recurring origination volume. Importantly, Athene funded the equity commitment in all three of these investments, as part of their normal course investment strategy, demonstrating the capital efficiency of our model. One, we announced our pending acquisition of a controlling stake in consumer lender, Aqua Finance, which will extend our access to quality consumer loans. In 2021, Aqua originated nearly $2 billion of loans in the consumer arena, which represents a double over the past three years. We also announced and closed our acquisition of Petros PACE Finance, a platform that provides significant deployment opportunity for Apollo and Athene to support clean energy real estate transactions. PACE has originated over $700 million in long-term fixed rate financing since 2016, and we expect rapid growth in that sector as the market expands and we confront sustainable construction and regulatory climate mandates. Finally, an important transaction was our strategic announcement with BNP Paribas to create Eliant inventory solutions. Eliant provides domestic and multinational companies with strategic and responsive inventory capital solutions to better optimize their supply chain and balance sheets. Backed by strong client demand at launch, we expect the platform to generate a multibillion-dollar level of annual flows beginning this year. These three platforms really are great examples of our broader fixed income replacement vision at work. While we are excited about the progress we've already achieved to broaden our origination, there is still significant runway to scale our existing platforms and fill in additional growth white space. At the macro level, we believe the evolving interest rate backup will create tactical opportunities to position our client portfolios into more favorable higher-yielding assets. As the market confronts a potentially higher rate environment, financial conditions are indeed tightening and risk premiums are increasing. For the last several years, there have been many -- there have been concerned about our ability to generate attractive returns in a perpetually low-rate environment. However, we always found ways to be successful and leaned into origination, and now we have an expansive ecosystem ready to capitalize on a market with potentially higher rates and certainly higher risk premiums. As we've said before, the fixed income replacement trend is just getting started, and we are certainly well positioned regardless of the rate environment. Moving on to monetization activity. We had another strong year of realizations, totaling $4 billion, including more than $3 billion from our Private Equity platform. For the full year, Private Equity realizations reached an annual record of $19 billion, as Fund VIII and increasingly Fund IX are in harvesting mode. Looking forward, we expect our realization super cycle to continue. That said, if the current market correction persists, some of our planned term realizations may be pushed out to later in the year. Turning to investment performance. We had a strong year of performance across our entire franchise. Our Private Equity portfolio appreciated 48% in 2021, outperforming the S&P by over 20%. And additionally, our flagship fund performance remains exceptional, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 48% and 30% net. And I'll mention, Fund IX's portfolio is still relatively young, and we believe there is a lot of embedded value still to come. Our inaugural hybrid value fund continues to perform very well, generating a growth of 29% and 23% net. And in credit, our portfolio saw 1.6% of gross appreciation in the fourth quarter and more than 10% for the full year. Finally, our structured credit debt origination strategies had particularly strong performance, both outperforming their respective benchmarks by a remarkable 1,100 basis points in 2021. In terms of capital raising, total inflows of $24 billion in the fourth quarter were strong, bringing full year inflows to $67 billion. As Marc mentioned, we raised a record amount of capital from third-party clients in a non-flagship fundraising year with $23 billion of total inflows. Athene added $37 billion of inflows, including 9 in the fourth quarter alone. Third-party fundraising in the fourth quarter totaled $8 billion, increasing from $5 billion average pace through the third quarter. And fourth quarter fundraising included healthy inflows from Accord plus EPF IV, and our second infrastructure fund, which held its final close in the quarter. Importantly, we launched the fundraising for Fund X in January and are encouraged by the early reception. We feel confident in raising our targeted $25 billion in capital and think our differentiated investment strategy, grounded in value while embracing innovation resonates, particularly well in this current market backdrop. We successfully launched our nonlisted credit BDC, Apollo Debt Solutions, in November with a single platform in Asia and Europe, and expanded distribution to the domestic platform in the beginning of January. Early reception of our marketing efforts have been extremely positive, and we raised over $1 billion of equity proceeds to date since product launched two months ago. When our exclusivity period ends in March, we will broaden distribution to other wire houses, several RIAs and at the independent broker-dealer channel via our strategic distribution partnerships. Additionally, we've invested heavily in product development and are currently working on several other funds tailored for the mass-affluent market. In December, we did announce the agreement to acquire Griffin, which is strategically important in our accelerating our multipronged five-year global wealth strategy. A year ago, we were more limited in our global wealth capabilities, but with the launch of ADS as well as Griffin, we now have proof of concept on product and distribution capability. When Griffin closes, which is expected to occur in the first half of this year, we will have roughly 130 people working across the platform. With Griffin specifically, we expect to broaden our reach in the US wealth market and independent broker-dealers, providing us with new foothold in that channel. We're continuing to add the resources and capabilities across various retail distribution channels in conjunction with the Griffin team. In terms of our outlook for 2022, we feel comfortable meeting or exceeding our $80 billion organic inflow target that we communicated in the fall. We are seeing a robust pipeline in Athene and momentum across third-party fundraising initiatives, including a strong start at ADS, as I've previously mentioned; and incremental Griffin -- flow at Griffin gives us great comfort. Looking back to 2021, we couldn't be more excited about the evolution of the franchise. We continue to expand the dialogue with our global investor base and continue to provide solutions to companies seeking to raise capital. We have leading returns in flagship Private Equity. We've launched nascent strategies with strong early performance and client traction, including hybrid value in the infrastructure equity business. Our yield platform is expanding along with the continued build-out of our front-end origination platforms. We're syndicating more dollars alongside a growing capital solutions business, and we're seeing increased demand for our third-party retirement services. We are excited to demonstrate meaningful progress against our goals, which we laid out in the fall. With that, I'll turn it over to my partner, Martin, who will discuss our financial results. Yes. I would just highlight, when we go through these origination platforms and people, really -- they still ask us what do you mean by fixing replacement. When we think about the Wheels, Donlen platform that we aggregate over the last 12 months, this is a company that's been around for 50 years, and it's been time-tested through the cycle with virtually negligible defaults. And they really are a large-scale auto fleet-finance business for many, many named consumer brand companies. Likewise, our inventory finance partnership with BNP, this is just providing capital where, in the past, investors had not had access to it. These were stuck on bank balance sheets. So when you talk about -- listen, we're students of the high yield and loan and leveraged loan in distressed markets. We are one of the preeminent players in the world. There probably would be some spread widening in those businesses, but that is not what's on the Athene and regulated balance sheets. We've been a pristine investor in those areas, and the performance in terms of the low defaults would really reflect that positioning. No. No. We've fixed it going through the close of the year. There's no impact.\nFinian O'Shea: Okay. Thanks so much. Well, I mean, I think we've been pretty clear over the last several months that we've been out in front with Fund X flagship, $25 billion. And Scott and the team are focused on that as the number one priority, but we have a variety of other institutional products between yield. And hybrid EPF is out there right now. Accord plus is out there right now. And so we're excited by the breadth of that. And certainly, when we think about what global wealth can do this year, we look at that contributing. In the past, it was sub-5% to 10%. And I think you're going to see in a number north of $5 billion or $6 billion on the global wealth part in addition. So we've got a lot of cylinders humming in the fundraising. And as we said, a $23 billion in 2021, ex the flagship, that's what gives us great comfort and confidence. Especially, I would add, what's really going on here for us, I know there's a tremendous amount of questions about rates in the curve, which are all critical to us. But what it really means for us it's the repricing of equity risk premium. And as Marc talked about, we've been in a decade where price didn't matter. And for us, as our strategy, all of this volatility in repricing risk premium, this is front and center of benefit of how we run our PE business. We're the classic leader in that global business in that field when there's market dispersion, hybrid value, tremendous product in that area as well. So, we feel very, very comfortable with it. If the macro moves, like we believe there will be more stock dispersion and what you've seen happen in certain growth areas, we just feel like that really plays right into our strategy."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Thank you for spending time with us. As I often say, I'm fortunate to lead a company in an industry that gets better every day. Our industry is driven by powerful trends, demographics, generational transfer of wealth, low rates and the extreme correlation and indexification of equity and fixed income markets. I am even more fortunate to lead a company with tremendous momentum and with a unique business model in the alternatives industry. 2021 was a transformational year for Apollo. AUM is a record; fundraising, a record; modernizations, a record; origination, a record; 424 people joined our platform, another record; and turnover was the lowest it's been in a very long time. We achieved 15% year-over-year FRE growth without any sizable inorganic activity and without a flagship fund, which, as all of you know, is in the cards for 2022. As excited as I was for 2021, 2022 should be even brighter. At our very detailed Investor Day in October, we communicated a strategic vision and financial plan. In just a few short months, we have made significant progress against that plan; recall the three pillars of that plan or the three key bets as we like to say. One was the growth in our retail business and retail franchise, which I will touch on, and Jim Zelter will spend more time on, the second, origination, which is the capacity to originate investments and, therefore, continue to provide above-average rates of return per unit of risk for our clients and the third, in our Capital Markets segment. Let me take a second and just briefly touch on each of those three bets. In origination, we originated $37 billion in the fourth quarter. We're now running well over $100 billion on an annual basis. Recall why this is important, our market sometimes loses sight of what's in short supply. Capital as a general matter is plentiful, and it is assets that offer appropriate risk rewards that are in short supply. So therefore, we are incredibly focused on growing our capacity to originate, assets that offer attractive risk rewards. They are, in fact, the limiter on our growth rather than the capacity to raise money. Every attractive asset that we originate across our platform has a home in a fund, in a co-invest, on a retirement services balance sheet or through syndication. In short, it is never capital that is in short supply, it is assets, and we are micro focused on scaling origination. Platforms, which are recurring originations, are a very significant portion of our strategy. In the fourth quarter alone, we added Aqua Finance in Consumer, Petros PACE Finance in solar, Alliant Inventory Solutions in partnership with BNP, and the momentum continues. No one is doing what we are doing at the size and scale, and we've talked a lot in our industry about permanent capital. I'm much more interested in talking with you about permanent origination. In Global Wealth, as you know, we announced the acquisition of Griffin. Griffin Capital is a meaningful accelerator to wealth platform. We also made, during the quarter, strategic investments in two technology companies to facilitate the growth of our distribution businesses. CASE and ICAP are two of the leading technology platforms, helping financial advisers, access alternative strategies. Tech-enabled distribution is a must-have for anyone hoping to serve this market. We also saw early product success in the channel. Our BDC, Apollo Debt Solutions, is off to a very strong start, which Jim Zelter will take you through. I continue to believe that democratization of finance is one of the most powerful tailwinds driving our platform. If you think about our industry and us, in particular, we, in the alternatives industry, have spent better than 30 years, on the cutting edge of creating products and services, primarily for large global institutions who are not taxpayers. We have an opportunity now as a result of increasing sophistication of retail investors, increasing technology, increased democratization and legalization of opportunity and this massive generational transfer of wealth, to take that brainpower and focused on creating products and services that are bespoke for this particular channel. Early iterations of serving this channel have been very successful, but really are the first step. They are nothing more than the institutionalization of products that already exist. I view the real steps here as creating unique products and services that are designed for this channel. And given our experience with Athene, which you will hear, we have tremendous insight into what it takes at a granular level to make be successful in this channel. On Capital Solutions, again, Jim will go in more detail. Suffice it to say, 2021 revenues in Capital Solutions were up 20% year-over-year. And as you know, our plan that we've communicated is a doubling of capital solutions revenue over the next five years. Significant landmark transaction, which I know Jim will touch on in the fourth quarter, is SoftBank, which will help you imagine where we're going with Capital Solutions. Noah touched briefly on our quarterly reporting. This is the last quarter that we will report on a standalone basis with the Athene merger having closed on January 1. Athene had an awesome 2021. As good a year as Apollo had, Athene had an even better year: record profitability, earning more than $2 billion; record organic inflows, more than $37 billion of organic inflows, not only record inflows across all four of its business channels, but the returns at which this new business was underwritten, significantly exceeded the compelling mid-teens target that we have. With the merger closed and collaboration and creativity ongoing, I see nothing but upside from the combination that closed just a month ago. I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on the market. Everywhere I go, people want to understand the impact of current market trends on our business. My standard answer, if you think about the environment, we've been in for the past 10 years, purchase price has not mattered. The more risk you took, the more outrageous, generally the higher the payoff. We have seen a significant correction across equity markets as a result of revaluations. We have also seen a significant change in fixed income markets as a result of Central Bank activity. Our platform is built for purchase price matters. We have achieved amazing results over the past decade in a market that has not necessarily been kind to our strategy and where our patient value-oriented, disciplined approach to capital deployment has not been rewarded. I believe we are in the right place at the right time. I believe the 2022 fund raise for APOLLO 10, that will be very successful as we offer our large institutional clients a different approach to how to get return in a market that is -- seems to have lost a bit of the go-go spirit. Let me pivot to merger and governance, as I get ready to hand over to Jim Zelter, who is chomping at the bit to take over. The merger with Athene closed on January 1. The next chapter is very exciting, low risk of execution, as we know each other incredibly well, having worked together for the past 12, 13 years. We are adding the 1,400-person Athene team to the roughly 2,000 Apollo employees; pro forma 3,500 total employees, approximately $40 billion of market cap. In addition to the Mira merger, this was an opportunity for us to complete the governance changes that we have had hinted at and been very explicit at throughout the last year. We are one share, one vote. We are a two-thirds independent Board. We have an independent Chair. And we have all of the requisite requirements to be eligible for broad index inclusion. Now let me conclude. I often say and I started our Strategy Day by really pointing out that culture beats strategy every day. We have built an incredible culture. The marketplace understands the long-term benefit of what we are building and is helping us to win the war on talent. People are attracted to the clear strategic vision, the authentic nature of the people they meet and our cultural values. As I suggested, we added 424 employees in 2021. While very exciting, we're not likely to repeat that in 2022, having made significant progress. These are senior hires across global wealth, origination, finance, Asia Pacific. We have incredible momentum going into 2022. The team is eager to execute the plan we have articulated for you. We're excited about the next chapter and a more profitable one Apollo and ready to take the hill. Let me now turn it over to my partner, Jim Zelter. That's right, Glen. Yeah, $1.4 billion, which is $2.35 per share. Great. Well, it's Marc. Why don't I take a shot at that, Glenn? So recall that in the last year, S&P has upgraded us to A+. And we hold substantially more capital than, I think, anyone else in the industry in terms of excess capital and reduce leverage. S&P, we also hold, as you know, primarily an investment-grade portfolio. S&P is now going through a process to update its model for the first time in 10 years. There's a lot of back and forth in an active dialogue. I think it's early to know whether there will be changes to the amount of excess capital. As a personal matter, it does not concern me. At the end of the day, we operate in an industry that is devoid of excess capital. We have been among the few. I mean, if you look at capital raised across the world, US and Europe, at least, we've raised most of the capital in the insurance industry for the past decade. Anything that puts pressure on capitalization, we tend to be in [Technical Difficulty]. Having said that, I don't expect much to come out of the S&P, but it's early days. As it relates to Private Equity in insurance, what's interesting is this is a journey we've been on for 12-plus years. We have paid an immense amount of tuition. And others who are interested in following what we do will quickly find out that this is not a trade. This is a lifestyle. And you have to build the infrastructure, capable navigating that you operate in a regulated business. But let's face it. All asset management business is a regulated business. We have a decade-plus of experience in working with regulators. Capital coming to the industry is generally a positive. Capital coming out of funds that have limited lives for a long-term asset is not generally viewed as a positive. New players coming to the business who understand that the primary risk, to putting risk on insurance company balance sheet through increased exposure to subordinated securities, are going to find out that that is not really going to be accepted broadly across the industry. What Jim articulated as fixed income replacement, which is maintaining the credit quality of the business while trying to earn excess spread, I believe, is the right strategy, certainly for us and probably for many others. But, I expect a lot of fits and starts on behalf of third parties as they try and figure it out. Thank you, Glenn. I\u2019m sure. So, Jim and I will tag team on credit. I'll start by pointing out that. Look we've been in a decade-long period where taking risk has been rewarded. And I didn't just mean my comments for equity. I meant for credit as well. We, as a firm have generally not saw to position our portfolio that way. We have almost always been senior secured. And the way we have earned excess return is through origination or taking some amount of liquidity risk rather than subordination risk, credit risk or duration risk. I believe we are well positioned in the portfolio for widening of rates and for credit cycle. And I don't want to belabor it, because I think Jim lives this every day. So, I'm going to flip it over to Jim to follow-up. Yes. And Bill, the quick answer is yes. The numbers we're underlying today are consistent with Investor Day. We're on track. We're fully in line with what we laid out in October. So it's the numbers, 2.35, 3.35 on a pretax basis. Yes, yes. Brian, it's pretty much linear. So, there's some floaters with floors, but we're above the floor. So think of it as 25, now 100 is four times 25 on that rate sensitivity. And in terms of how quickly that pulls through into earnings, about half of that is in three-month LIBOR and the other half is split between shorter and longer, one model and six equivalents. It's Marc, and I'll take a shot at it, and then Jim will fill in where I miss. Think of origination as having three parts to it. One part calling effort, calling on large companies, the scale of our ecosystem. Remember, we have the largest private credit platform in the world, at least that I'm aware of, more than $350 billion. We have an incredible ecosystem. So we call on companies. And you've seen the results of that coming out of the things we've done with ADNOC, with Hertz and with so and so. The second part of it is a -- just by being such a large ecosystem and capital market participant, we benefit from capital markets-originated flows, think of SoftBank as something coming to us as a result of capital markets. The third is the notion of platforms. Platforms are companies that, in and of themselves, are attractive investments, but the business they pursue is the origination of credit, Wheels, Donlen and so on and so. So I believe we are still early days in the platform acquisition business. We have made significant inroads in fleet finance and aircraft finance, in senior secured middle-market finance, in inventory, in franchise fees and a number of other areas. And I think what you will see is, yes, we will continue to go into new areas. But I think what you're going to see is the existing platforms get scale. Just like Donlen and Wheels came together, I think you will see us this year, in particular, add scale to what we do. The resource commitment that we have in our internal FIG group, I predict our FIG and Strategy Group will be the size of our Private Equity group over the next few years. This is a full-court press, a full-time effort. Origination and recurring origination is among the most valuable things that we do. One last footnote on it. When we buy an origination platform, the we is generally Athene, Thora and our institutional limited-partner clients. They like in buying an origination because this is a perpetual machine that generally produces relatively safe low-teens recurring rates of return. It in some ways, it is a perfect alternative for large sovereign funds and for large retirement services balance sheets. But it is a two-fold, not only do we get an attractive alternative equity investment, which generally is funded, as I suggested, out of the Retirement Services balance sheet and a limited partner capital, we also get origination. Some of that origination is absorbed internally in Retirement Services balance sheets and credit funds, and some of it goes external through our capital markets and syndication business. This is a significant feeder to our ecosystem. Every day, the reinforcement of the ecosystem gets better and better through these platforms.\nFinian O'Shea: Thank you. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, if I may. I'm sorry if I missed this. Can you talk about the trade-off on the Athene fixed income mark-to-market fee arrangements? Did you have to take a concession on the fee for that exchange? Great. Robert, its Marc, I'll take a shot at this. I like your definition of quiet. The team in the room that works on Athora said, they'd like to understand what busy is then. So if you think about what's happened to Athora over the reasonable period of time, we obviously did a very large transaction in the Netherlands for VIVAT, adding some \u20ac40 billion to the balance sheet. We also did add-ons in Belgium, and we did a de novo in Italy this year, so another \u20ac8 million to \u20ac10 billion. That seemed like plenty, for the year. We are, as you suggested, absorbing. 2021 has been a year of absorbing. You should expect us to do a sizable capital raise at Athora at some point during the year. Apollo led that off with a \u20ac250 million upsize in a safe, pending the future capital raise. What we're also starting to see is, people turning themselves to new business. Very often what happens in -- particularly in something like the Netherlands, is it takes a while to understand exactly what the opportunity is on a go-forward basis. And so we've started to see the equivalent of a pension risk transfer market really developed in Europe. In terms of what's going to happen in Europe this year, I believe it will be an incredibly active year. All indications tell me that there will be sizable blocks of business that change hands. The pickup in rates, in some ways, is actually helpful in reducing the embedded loss of a lot of these historic books of business to the legacy companies. So in short, I thought 2021 was very active, but I expect 2022 to be even more active, on a go-forward basis. And I'll make one final point. Whatever tuition needed to be paid in the U.S. over more than a decade, this is advanced chemistry. It is a much more complicated market. Solvency II is a much more complicated regime to operate in. Being able to speak both languages, RBC and Solvency II, is a huge advantage. You're seeing it. Japan is moving towards Solvency II, Hong Kong and the rest of Asia, moving towards Solvency II. And you've seen us across the platform, not just in Athora, but also in Athene, be able to take the skill set of understanding how a Solvency II balance sheet works and do the first couple of reinsurance transactions in Japan for Athene. So I expect this to continue to be a very active area. And more than you want to know, but the commoditization of publicly traded fixed income and the inability of traditional market participants to earn excess return in fixed income is the driver that is pushing the disposition of these blocks of business. And I think this is going to continue. So Alex, there is no impact. There's no day one impact to the change in the fee basis. And as we go through purchase accounting and the PCAOB process, book value converges to market value at day one. So they -- the book value sort of becomes market value and resets in new basis going forward. And so it's the same asset value that you're using to reference the fee rate. And there's no other adjustments to the contract. So that's pretty clean, I think, and straightforward. And on the spread duration and the spread risk, I would think of that as having a similar profile to credit -- to rates. But obviously, it depends on turnover in the portfolio, rates reset every month, every quarter. Spreads reset as you buy and sell security. So it's kind of more prolonged impact on the pull-through. I'll take a shot at it. It's Marc. So, for the -- from inception, Athene produced about a 17.7% return on book value. We continue to underwrite business, and we underwrote business in 2021 at north of 15% cash-on-cash. Our target in retirement services is that mid-teens rate of return on a sustainable basis. And we really -- rates themselves don't really matter. And I'm not convinced spreads matter, because the market adjusts to the pricing of new liabilities get added in the context of a competitive market. The ability to source assets is the primary driver of the growth and profitability of Retirement Services. And so, what we have done is we have, as you've been hearing for this call, made a massive bet over many years on origination that you're seeing that come to fruition and the kind of origination that benefits retirement services balance sheets. By going to third parties and opening up to third parties, that is a win-win on both sides. We also run a prudent diversified book. And we have absolutely no problem syndicating to other insurers, to other money managers and to other clients. For us, we get more flow, we get more diversification, we continue to build our ecosystem, and we get plenty of product to satisfy the internal needs from Athene and from Athora and from the various credit funds. On the other hand, if you're a client, you have the opportunity to invest side-by-side with us in an aligned fashion as where we're a principal, not just a broker, not an asset manager. Alignment is an unbelievably powerful tool in this particular area, and I think we're seeing the benefits of that."

It's my pleasure to start out and outline another quarter of very strong results. DE for the quarter was $1.71 per share, our highest quarter on record. FRE of $300 million or $0.68 a share, very strong performance. FRE for the first 9 months, $2.01 per share, up 16% year-over-year for the same period. And as you will hear from Scott, we're seeing strong momentum across all fronts, whether it's investment, deployment, realization or fundraising. Year-to-date organic Athene inflows plus third-party fundraising were $44 billion, and we expect them to exceed $55 billion for the year. Importantly, this will be a record year of organic growth at Athene; and, equally as important, this will be a record year of fundraising in a non-flagship year for Apollo, and this again is despite headwinds from the end of 2020. We are well positioned to execute on our long-term targets and deliver for our shareholders. Let me now pivot from the quarter and focus on next year and the next 5 years. Two weeks ago, many of you endured 5 hours of us walking you through our strategic plan. We enjoyed the opportunity to share our road map and to show you how we are positioned to drive the business forward. Rather than rehearse or repeat 5 hours' worth of material, for those who are interested, let's hit the cliff notes. We're in a growth business, driven by the need for retirement income in an anemic market. Our addressable market is the largest among our alternative peers focused, in particular, on fixed income replacement. Athene is a competitive differentiator and a growth accelerant. Our model is highly capital efficient, and I will focus a little bit on this quarter's activities and show you just how efficient. And we have a strong momentum behind a fully aligned industry-leading team and continue to add amazing talent. A reminder, our business is not about just scale. It is not about AUM. It is about delivering excess return per unit of risk to our clients. That is the promise of alternatives. And so long as we do that, we will continue to grow. And the reminder to everyone in our firm is that AUM growth is the reward for good performance. It is not the goal. As many of you took away from the 5-hour dialogue, our plan embeds 3 key bets. One, an expansion into retail following the democratization of finance; the second, growth in capital solutions; and the third, direct origination and scaling of direct origination from roughly $80 billion on an annual basis run rate this year to $150 billion 5 years out. While progress was made against all 3 objectives, this quarter was all about origination with numerous platform additions within our ecosystem. The team, led by Chris Edson, is laser-focused on continuing to scale our origination, which ultimately is 1 of the drivers of growth in our fixed income replacement business and our yield business. Just to highlight 3 additions to our ecosystem announced or closed this quarter. The first was MaxCap. MaxCap is an Australian CRE, financier and fund manager. The second is Newfi. Newfi is a technology-driven multichannel mortgage lender. And the third is Wheels, which will be merged with our existing Donlin fleet platform, creating combined fleet business with $5 billion of pro forma assets and 550,000 customers. Each of these 3 will drive significant amounts of investment-grade, private and spread enhancing origination. Origination, and the ability to find spread without taking on increased risk, is the driver to success in our yield business. Importantly, none of the capital to add to these 3 platforms or to acquire these 3 platforms was required from the Apollo Holding Company. As many of you who teamed into our Investor Day understand, we run an incredibly capital efficient business and are able to scale these origination platforms without capital from the holding company, leaving us free to deploy that capital towards growth initiatives or to return to shareholders. In summary, our business is changing rapidly. Markets, rates and technology and democratization of finance are all sources of this change. Rather than fear this change, we embrace this change. We're going to continue to lead into technology and innovation and capitalize on these disruptive trends. The platform continues to attract incredibly high-quality talent, and I'd highlight just 2 for this quarter. First, Bill Lewis, joining us as Senior Partner and a member of Apollo's management committee; and the second, Dave Stangis, our new Chief Sustainability Officer, also a member of Apollo's Management Committee. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott to review the quarter in more detail.\nScott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As you've heard us say before, our strategic differentiator is our ability to source excess returns across the risk-reward spectrum. The breadth and scale of our platform gives us confidence in our ability to originate attractive investment opportunities for our clients and deploy capital in a variety of environments. For the third quarter, total deployment of over $28 billion set another quarterly record. Year-to-date deployment volume is tracking nearly $81 billion compared with $88 billion for full year 2020 and $75 billion for full year 2019. These figures indicate the tremendous amounts of investment activity taking place across our platform. In our Private Equity business, drawdown funds invested $5 billion, including for Yahoo! Great Canadian and W.R. Grace, and committed to invest an additional $6.5 billion as of quarter end. Additionally, investing activity for Athene accelerated significantly from second quarter levels as cash was put to work. Moving on to debt origination. Total origination volume of $19 billion in the third quarter is run rating at the $80 billion level that we disclosed at Investor Day. Our origination machine continues to build momentum, led by robust MidCap volume, Redding Ridge CLO formation and strength out of our Europe platform. We also have line of sight into a healthy high-grade alpha pipeline over the next couple of quarters. While we spend most of our time sourcing incremental investment opportunities, today's environment has been accommodative to harvest ripe investments within our portfolio. You can see from our results that we're in the midst of a robust realization cycle, with overlap from Fund VIII and Fund IX monetization activity. We're delivering tremendous value back to our LPs while, at the same time, generating attractive performance fees for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $8.8 billion of capital to fund our -- to our fund investors, including $6.2 billion from our Private Equity funds. Year-to-date, Private Equity realizations have reached $16 billion, which compares to $5 billion for all of 2020. Looking out over the next several quarters, the realization pipeline remains strong for our flagship Private Equity funds. As Marc highlighted earlier, overall investment performance remains solid within the PE portfolio, up 4.8%, and core credit up 2.1% during the quarter. In Private Equity, we saw divergence in returns between our funds private and public positions, which is not uncommon given the volatility in public markets. Private markets were up 12%, while public holdings, representing roughly 20% of our portfolio, declined 12%. Additionally, our Private Equity portfolio has appreciated 58% over the last 12 months. Overall, our flagship Private Equity Fund performance remains quite strong, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 47% and 28% net. Our inaugural hybrid value fund also continues to deliver exceptional performance, with a gross IRR of 32% and 26% net. In Credit, we saw particularly good gross returns in direct origination, up 3.2%, and in structured credit, up 2.9% during the quarter. Overall, we continue to be positioned cautiously across the portfolio. But with that said, we continue to see substantial demand for fixed income replacement assets. Moving to capital raising. We're encouraged by recent LP conversations and new strategic mandate wins as third quarter AUM increased $9 billion sequentially. Total inflows were quite strong at $18 billion, up from $12 billion in the second quarter, and were broad-based. We continue to see impressive organic growth from Athene, driven by the diversity of their low-cost funding origination capabilities as we recently highlighted at our Investor Day. Gross inflows from Athene totaled $12 billion in the third quarter and $28 billion year-to-date, and we still expect approximately $35 billion of gross inflows for the full year 2021. Third-party inflows exceeded $5 billion in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $15 billion. Third quarter activity was driven by nearly $2.5 billion from high-grade alpha mandates, bringing total high-grade alpha SMAs to over $4 billion. As we communicated at Investor Day, we expect to raise approximately $23 billion of third-party capital for full year '21, which implies a pickup in fourth quarter fundraising levels. The near-term fundraising pipeline includes fundraising for Accord Plus EPF 4 and [Revolver 2]. Additionally, with Fund IX 75% committed as of quarter end, we expect to launch the formal fundraising process for Fund X in the first quarter of 2022. In conclusion, we're encouraged by the progress we've already made to execute on our vision for tomorrow's Apollo. As Marc emphasized, we're continuing to build out our origination ecosystem to capitalize on a larger fixed income addressable market. The upcoming merger with Athene is key to this strategy, especially as a provider of a growing stream of low-cost funding. So with that, I'll hand it over to Martin to go through this quarter's financial results in more detail.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks, Scott. From a financial perspective, today's results provided a strong and supportive first step towards our multiyear goals that we laid out at our recent Investor Day. In the third quarter, we generated record after-tax distributable earnings of $752 million or $1.71 per share. DE was up sharply quarter-over-quarter, driven by Private Equity net realized performance fees of $0.74 per share and realized investment income of $0.66 per share. Robust net realized performance fees of $312 million were up $90 million sequentially, primarily related to strong realization activity in Fund VIII with notable transactions, including OneMain Financial, Double Eagle Energy and Apollo Education; and the first realized carry distribution from Fund IX, driven by Tech Data and Smart & Final. Particularly strong realized investment income during the quarter was driven by the monetization of our platform investment in Venerable, which was sold to certain funds we manage, and Athora. This mutually beneficial transaction allowed Apollo to redeploy capital into other strategic priorities while presenting a compelling investment opportunity at an attractive entry valuation for Athora and our fund investors. Our record DE result in the quarter was also attributable to our strong and consistent fee-related earnings, which amounted to $300 million or $0.68 per share. Despite strong realization activity, management fees continued to demonstrate growth, increasing 9% year-over-year. We generated $65 million of transaction and advisory fees during the third quarter, primarily driven by our Private Equity business and reflecting transaction fees in connection with a number of portfolio investments, including co-investment activity on the Yahoo! transaction. As we discussed at Investor Day, with an increasing focus on building and leveraging our capital solutions capabilities, you should expect the annual revenue contribution from transaction and advisory fees to increase meaningfully over the coming years. Fees related -- fee-related performance fees rose $12 million sequentially. As a reminder, these fees represent incentive-based fees from platforms or permanent capital vehicles, including Redding Ridge, the public BDC we manage and MidCap. The third quarter level is a reasonable approximation for the quarterly revenue we expect going forward. Fee-related expenses were relatively flat sequentially despite continued hiring due to start date timing. We expect fee-related expenses, both comp and non-comp costs, to increase in the fourth quarter related to this elevated hiring trend, in line with our full year 2021 margin target of approximately 54%. We expect the pace of headcount and compensation growth to normalize as we move through 2022, and the accelerated investment spend is fully incorporated into our run rate. As we explained at Investor Day, we are focused on completing a significant compensation reset that will create better alignment with investment performance and drive our future FRE compensation ratio downward. These changes will create strong alignment with shareholders and serve to increase our highest value earnings streams. As a result of this reset, we expect to experience an accelerated stock-based compensation charge around the time the merger closes. This number was reflected in the pro forma share count of approximately 600 million total shares we presented at Investor Day and does not change any of our forward earnings goals. We expect this noncash item will impact our GAAP net income, but not our operating results. Turning to AUM. Total AUM of $481 billion was up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 11% year-over-year, driven by $18 billion of inflows, which Scott detailed, and solid investment performance, partially offset by higher realizations. We declared a dividend of $0.50 per share, in line with our previous guidance, as we continue to glide path to our new fixed dividend policy. We retained excess DE of approximately $500 million for continued growth opportunities, which funded our investments of approximately $350 million in the quarter in Motive and Challenger. We expect the fourth quarter dividend, paid in February, to reflect our new dividend policy of $0.40 per quarter or $1.60 per year. Our net balance sheet value in the third quarter increased to $5.1 billion, up from $4.8 billion in the second quarter, and our cash on hand increased to $2.1 billion. Additionally, we expect to exceed the $4 DE per share guidance for 2021 that we communicated on our prior earnings call, in light of the $3.51 DE per share we've reported year-to-date. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by reiterating how much we all enjoyed the opportunity to outline our strategic vision and financial targets at our recent Investor Day. We feel confident in achieving our base plan over the next 5 years, which includes growing fee-related revenue by 2.25x driven by growth in AUM and capital solutions; FRE by 2.5x due to positive operating leverage; and SRE by 1.75x, as the retirement services platforms continue to scale with the benefit of third-party capital. Overall, our goal is to more than double our DE to more than $9 per share by 2026, even before driving accretion from investing $5 billion of growth capital or executing share repurchases. We hope our strong Q3 results provide you early confidence in our ability to execute on this plan, with trailing 12-month FRE and DE, up 16% and 81% year-over-year, respectively. While certain quarterly or annual periods may show lower or higher growth, particularly as we wrap up our accelerated investments across the platform, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goal of 18% compound growth in FRE and 60%-plus margins over the next 5 years. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I just wanted to come back to some of the strategic mandate wins that you alluded to earlier. I think this was in Credit. I was just hoping you could maybe give us an update on how much capital you manage in some of these strategic mandates today? And maybe if you could elaborate on where you're seeing some of the strength of flows coming into these mandates? And if you could just also talk about how you think about scaling these sort of customized mandates over time?\nMartin Kelly: Mike, it's Martin. So we spoke to mandates, which were specific in the quarter to high-grade alpha, but this has been a focus of ours for a long time. And we have over $30 billion in mandates across the platform today, and that number continues to increase as we bring new mandates on, which are customized for individual LPs and provide access to investments across the platform.\nMarc Rowan: It's Marc. I'll expand on it for 1 second. Martin is right, he's given you all the numbers, but let me kind of describe what it is we're trying to do. Strategic mandate definitionally is with a large account who's prepared to invest across the platform. But what is it they're trying to achieve? Really what they're trying to achieve is alignment. And so we are a pro forma for the merger with Athene, an immense investor in our own products. There is nothing more comforting for another large strategic account than to have us invested side-by-side. I think you will see us more and more emphasize the notion of alignment, both in the fixed income area and increasingly in the equity area, as no other firm will have the kind of alignment and, therefore, investment in products side by side with our clients that we will pro forma.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So I just want to dig into the expansion into retail. For you all, I wouldn't mind getting a little bit more about what you think in terms of product development. You've mentioned [cash drop in ACRA], but tough timing, focus and key attributes that will differentiate your products there. And then just while we have it, I'll just give my follow-up as well. Since Investor Day, we've seen 2 deals, and I would just describe them as traditional asset managers buying their way into the alternatives world, they have retail distribution and now they're getting products. I'm curious to get your thoughts on that reverses commute as opposed to you with product building out distribution.\nScott Kleinman: Sure. So I'll take the first part of that. So as we described in Investor Day, we are in the midst of dramatically building out our retail capabilities. By year-end, we'll have about 30 professionals on our way to about 100 over the next couple of years. That's going to really help us move a number of products, both purpose-built for retail type products as well as further driving retail components of our traditional institutional products. One of the first products coming to market is our private BDC, which will be fully in the market by the beginning of the year. That's going to be our expectation, 1 of our flagship retail products, given the strength of our credit capabilities. But over the course of the year, we're going to have a few other products coming out as well. So we're incredibly optimistic on what our retail capabilities will be and the product development behind it.\nMarc Rowan: First, thanks for tuning after suffering through 5 hours. But I guess I'd give you the following perspective. The thing that's in short supply is assets. Yes, building out [supply] is assets. Yes, building out and reaching a retail channel is -- requires effort and requires infrastructure. But ultimately, every asset that offers a good risk/reward has a home. There is no shortage of capital to find those assets. To reach a retail audience, one needs the retail audience to accept some amount of illiquidity. That is ultimately what moving into an alternative is. Increasingly, we've seen better acceptance of high net worth and retail investors of this amount of illiquidity, whether it's a private BDC, a private REIT or a true alternative in terms of the equity area. The big firms, the traditional asset managers that are buying in, in many ways, are simply validating what's there, which is the traditional markets cannot offer sustainable alpha and sustainable outperformance. And so they are recognizing that they have to go and purchase that. Ultimately, this trend -- the ability of a retail firm to distribute these products will depend in part on their -- the capacity of their retail system. Many of these traditional retail systems are not set up to offer illiquid products. And so everyone is essentially building toward this market in retail. But I come back to the place I started. Generating assets that offer attractive risk/rewards is ultimately the key to success. They will go to retail. They will go to institutional. They will go to capital solutions. They will go to retirement services balance sheets. And we want to serve all of those. We currently serve 3 of those very well, and we're building on the fourth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research\nPatrick Davitt: On Australia, you mentioned MaxCap in the prepared remarks, and I think there's news that you've hired a bunch of other senior origination type people there this week. Could you update us on the opportunity there to maybe build something like it feels like you're starting to build a portfolio of origination capability there, perhaps specifically for something similar. So any thoughts around what the opportunity there is? And can we start thinking about this being something like Athene in Australia?\nScott Kleinman: Yes. Look, as we highlighted at Investor Day, Asia is probably the biggest untapped market for us on the retirement services side, massive market, very fragmented, different regulatory environments, so really plays to the strengths of Apollo. We've started entering that market in a few different ways. We've made investments in a couple of large established retirement service platforms over there. We've also been entering into a number of flow reinsurance agreements in Asia as well as another way to play to our strength. I think over time, you'll see more activity out of us in this, both on the asset and liability side and could ultimately create a consolidated platform for ourselves. But right now, the strategy is really getting into the market through some well-established players.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.\nWilliam Katz: I may have missed it, I apologize. Can you just sort of go back and sort of talk through the sizable investment income on -- in the quarter? I think you mentioned that there was maybe some intercompany sale going on. Just sort of wondering what that was and sort of how I think about the go-forward impact of that?\nMartin Kelly: Yes, Bill, it's Martin. So that earnings related to our investment in Venerable, which was the variable annuity platform that we set up some years back, it was not an intercompany sale. We sold to fund investors into Athora. And it was -- this was a great investment, and it was something that was ultimately not intended to be part of the Apollo ecosystem. And so we realized a great return, and we're recycling that capital back into other uses.\nMarc Rowan: And Bill, it's Marc. I'll probably just expand on it. Venerable was a private entity that Apollo, Athene and 2 other private equity firms bought -- created really some number of years ago in connection with the acquisition of Voya's Variable Annuity business. In our view, Variable is not a great product to be part of a public company, given the inherent volatility of GAAP results if business is run properly. Having said that, it's been an amazing investment, all around. In the last year, a second block of business was added in connection with the Equitable transaction. And Equitable became an investor in the platform, side by side with the existing private equity firms and with Apollo and with Athene. At the Equitable mark, Apollo sold its position in Venerable to 1 of its funds and to Athora. There was obviously demand from other entities, including the other private equity firms, for that same stake. But this -- again, this was a great investment, and it's a great tool to have in our toolbox to offer the industry complete solutions in connection with delevering their insurance and retirement services balance sheets, but it is not a permanent part of Apollo on a recurring basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: I have a question as, I guess, relates more specifically to Athene going forward. But I guess there's been some accounting changes relates to insurance companies as LDTI, I guess. And I mean, is that going to have -- would that have any impact at all on how you think about Athene's ability to maybe not originate product, but from an accounting or a capital perspective or how you would think about reporting the results?\nMarc Rowan: In short, no. I mean one of the interesting things about Athene is Athene was started, as you know, in 2008 and 2009, and therefore, acquired a set of liabilities at a point in time when interest rates were very low and when there was pretty good understanding of where accounting was going. And so we, at Apollo, have been on top of, and Athene has been on top of, the setting up of the reserves at each point in time. And Athene has its call tomorrow. And I think it would be a good question for you to ask them about the LDTI and specifically, the percentage of their business that is -- comes with writers and other forms of variability versus the industry. And you'll, I believe, receive a very satisfactory answer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Scott, as you embark on Fund X, it sounds like first quarter, you guys are going to begin to fundraising. Can you maybe talk us through your latest thinking about sizing and what you're starting to hear from how much of the fund you expect to ultimately be re-ups from existing LPs versus some new folks? Just general thoughts around how you expect this fund to unfold.\nScott Kleinman: Yes, sure. So as you can imagine, I've been out, as others have, talking to LPs over the last couple of months. And feedback is incredibly strong. So I'm feeling very confident going into the fundraise early next year. The backdrop of demand is incredibly strong in the alternative space, particularly in Private Equity. And we have thankfully been posting really good performance. So all those things really point towards a very robust fund raise. We're not sort of giving out specific numbers, but would expect the fund raise to be at least as large as the current fund, the $25 billion. So like I said, we feel really good about that. Look, as far as the mix, each of our last several funds have been about 80% re-ups, 20% new investors based on our relationship building that probably feels like a good number, but ultimately, we'll see over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rufus Hone with Bank of Montreal.\nRufus Hone: I had a longer-term one on Athora. And I'd love to hear your thoughts around how you view the organic growth potential of Athora over time. Because when you look back at Athene, the organic growth really started to pick up around 5 years ago. And I was wondering if there are any structural differences between the way Athora is set up in Europe that might make it harder to scale business organically over time?\nScott Kleinman: Right. Sure. So Athora was -- has been set up like Athene initially was as buying blocks of runoff insurance. Athene got into the organic growth business over time through acquisitions and through development of their various retail and organic channels. Athora, if you look at for its first several years, has largely been that same runoff business. However, through an acquisition it just announced in Italy, it actually is picking up a meaningful new organic business platform and would expect, as it grows its Italian presence and is looking at certain other countries, could certainly consider to look at organic growth as well as the inorganic activity. In addition, the European PRT market is in its early stages, but is clearly poised to be as big or bigger than the U.S. market. And so Athora is getting organized around that as well. So to answer your initial question, nothing is structurally different or would structurally prevent that. Obviously, they're slightly different markets with different products. But where it makes sense, I would expect that, that will be the case.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jefferies.\nGerald O'Hara: I think in the prepared remarks, you all mentioned a kind of a pickup in 4Q fundraising. I was kind of hoping you might be able to flesh that out a little bit. And also, I guess, as we think about moving into next year beyond Fund X, what -- kind of what you're looking for to drive fundraising efforts?\nScott Kleinman: Sure. So as I alluded to in the comments, we have a number of funds expecting closes in the fourth quarter. So things like EPF is going to have its first sizable first close. Accord Plus, Hybrid Value will have another close. So just a number of variety of different funds across the PE hybrid and yield platforms. Next year, as you can imagine, a big part of the focus in the first part of the year will be our Fund X flagship, but EPF and Impact, plus several of our credit products will be having fundraises going on as well throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: This is Brian McKenna for Devin. So at the Investor Day, you spoke at length about the opportunity within fintech and how Apollo can leverage this to drive a number of benefits and efficiencies across the platform. This might be difficult to answer, but is there any way to quantify the impact of this longer term, specifically as it relates to revenues and expenses?\nMarc Rowan: In short, no. I think it is difficult. I think as I mentioned -- it's Marc, by the way. As we mentioned on Investor Day, this is a multipronged opportunity. And the easiest is to understand is cost. Obviously, moving securitizations from their current form to blockchain is an information advantage and a cost advantage. Its AUM, providing our capacity to accept large amounts of committed yield in the origination area to FinTech Challengers, should be a source of AUM growth and is -- takes up a considerable amount of our time. Investing in and benefiting from the fintech ecosystem with us as a large customer and as a large financial institution is also part of the playbook. But I think you should think about this very holistically. Technology is going to impact every part of our business. Ultimately, you'll see it probably first in Capital Solutions, which is the business that Craig Farr runs. Today, that business runs a salesperson to salesperson. It will not surprise you that we believe it will ultimately run linked to link. And it will be just a much more efficient way and someone will -- an investor will be able to enter an Apollo ecosystem and decide how to invest and where to invest in addition to the traditional methods. That does not mean that funds and fundraising are going to disappear quite the contrary. I think this is for a certain set of products and a certain set of institutions. But I do think innovation and change are coming to our corner of the industry. And I, for one, welcome it.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing remarks.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thank you, again, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Apollo. If you have any questions regarding anything we discussed on today's call, please feel free to reach out to us, and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Gross inflows from Athene totaled $12 billion in the third quarter and $28 billion year-to-date, and we still expect approximately $35 billion of gross inflows for the full year 2021. Third-party inflows exceeded $5 billion in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $15 billion. Third quarter activity was driven by nearly $2.5 billion from high-grade alpha mandates, bringing total high-grade alpha SMAs to over $4 billion. As we communicated at Investor Day, we expect to raise approximately $23 billion of third-party capital for full year '21, which implies a pickup in fourth quarter fundraising levels. The near-term fundraising pipeline includes fundraising for Accord Plus EPF 4 and [Revolver 2]. Additionally, with Fund IX 75% committed as of quarter end, we expect to launch the formal fundraising process for Fund X in the first quarter of 2022. In conclusion, we're encouraged by the progress we've already made to execute on our vision for tomorrow's Apollo. As Marc emphasized, we're continuing to build out our origination ecosystem to capitalize on a larger fixed income addressable market. The upcoming merger with Athene is key to this strategy, especially as a provider of a growing stream of low-cost funding. So with that, I'll hand it over to Martin to go through this quarter's financial results in more detail. Sure. So I'll take the first part of that. So as we described in Investor Day, we are in the midst of dramatically building out our retail capabilities. By year-end, we'll have about 30 professionals on our way to about 100 over the next couple of years. That's going to really help us move a number of products, both purpose-built for retail type products as well as further driving retail components of our traditional institutional products. One of the first products coming to market is our private BDC, which will be fully in the market by the beginning of the year. That's going to be our expectation, 1 of our flagship retail products, given the strength of our credit capabilities. But over the course of the year, we're going to have a few other products coming out as well. So we're incredibly optimistic on what our retail capabilities will be and the product development behind it. Yes. Look, as we highlighted at Investor Day, Asia is probably the biggest untapped market for us on the retirement services side, massive market, very fragmented, different regulatory environments, so really plays to the strengths of Apollo. We've started entering that market in a few different ways. We've made investments in a couple of large established retirement service platforms over there. We've also been entering into a number of flow reinsurance agreements in Asia as well as another way to play to our strength. I think over time, you'll see more activity out of us in this, both on the asset and liability side and could ultimately create a consolidated platform for ourselves. But right now, the strategy is really getting into the market through some well-established players. Yes, sure. So as you can imagine, I've been out, as others have, talking to LPs over the last couple of months. And feedback is incredibly strong. So I'm feeling very confident going into the fundraise early next year. The backdrop of demand is incredibly strong in the alternative space, particularly in Private Equity. And we have thankfully been posting really good performance. So all those things really point towards a very robust fund raise. We're not sort of giving out specific numbers, but would expect the fund raise to be at least as large as the current fund, the $25 billion. So like I said, we feel really good about that. Look, as far as the mix, each of our last several funds have been about 80% re-ups, 20% new investors based on our relationship building that probably feels like a good number, but ultimately, we'll see over the next couple of quarters. Right. Sure. So Athora was -- has been set up like Athene initially was as buying blocks of runoff insurance. Athene got into the organic growth business over time through acquisitions and through development of their various retail and organic channels. Athora, if you look at for its first several years, has largely been that same runoff business. However, through an acquisition it just announced in Italy, it actually is picking up a meaningful new organic business platform and would expect, as it grows its Italian presence and is looking at certain other countries, could certainly consider to look at organic growth as well as the inorganic activity. In addition, the European PRT market is in its early stages, but is clearly poised to be as big or bigger than the U.S. market. And so Athora is getting organized around that as well. So to answer your initial question, nothing is structurally different or would structurally prevent that. Obviously, they're slightly different markets with different products. But where it makes sense, I would expect that, that will be the case. Sure. So as I alluded to in the comments, we have a number of funds expecting closes in the fourth quarter. So things like EPF is going to have its first sizable first close. Accord Plus, Hybrid Value will have another close. So just a number of variety of different funds across the PE hybrid and yield platforms. Next year, as you can imagine, a big part of the focus in the first part of the year will be our Fund X flagship, but EPF and Impact, plus several of our credit products will be having fundraises going on as well throughout the year."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Scott. From a financial perspective, today's results provided a strong and supportive first step towards our multiyear goals that we laid out at our recent Investor Day. In the third quarter, we generated record after-tax distributable earnings of $752 million or $1.71 per share. DE was up sharply quarter-over-quarter, driven by Private Equity net realized performance fees of $0.74 per share and realized investment income of $0.66 per share. Robust net realized performance fees of $312 million were up $90 million sequentially, primarily related to strong realization activity in Fund VIII with notable transactions, including OneMain Financial, Double Eagle Energy and Apollo Education; and the first realized carry distribution from Fund IX, driven by Tech Data and Smart & Final. Particularly strong realized investment income during the quarter was driven by the monetization of our platform investment in Venerable, which was sold to certain funds we manage, and Athora. This mutually beneficial transaction allowed Apollo to redeploy capital into other strategic priorities while presenting a compelling investment opportunity at an attractive entry valuation for Athora and our fund investors. Our record DE result in the quarter was also attributable to our strong and consistent fee-related earnings, which amounted to $300 million or $0.68 per share. Despite strong realization activity, management fees continued to demonstrate growth, increasing 9% year-over-year. We generated $65 million of transaction and advisory fees during the third quarter, primarily driven by our Private Equity business and reflecting transaction fees in connection with a number of portfolio investments, including co-investment activity on the Yahoo! transaction. As we discussed at Investor Day, with an increasing focus on building and leveraging our capital solutions capabilities, you should expect the annual revenue contribution from transaction and advisory fees to increase meaningfully over the coming years. Fees related -- fee-related performance fees rose $12 million sequentially. As a reminder, these fees represent incentive-based fees from platforms or permanent capital vehicles, including Redding Ridge, the public BDC we manage and MidCap. The third quarter level is a reasonable approximation for the quarterly revenue we expect going forward. Fee-related expenses were relatively flat sequentially despite continued hiring due to start date timing. We expect fee-related expenses, both comp and non-comp costs, to increase in the fourth quarter related to this elevated hiring trend, in line with our full year 2021 margin target of approximately 54%. We expect the pace of headcount and compensation growth to normalize as we move through 2022, and the accelerated investment spend is fully incorporated into our run rate. As we explained at Investor Day, we are focused on completing a significant compensation reset that will create better alignment with investment performance and drive our future FRE compensation ratio downward. These changes will create strong alignment with shareholders and serve to increase our highest value earnings streams. As a result of this reset, we expect to experience an accelerated stock-based compensation charge around the time the merger closes. This number was reflected in the pro forma share count of approximately 600 million total shares we presented at Investor Day and does not change any of our forward earnings goals. We expect this noncash item will impact our GAAP net income, but not our operating results. Turning to AUM. Total AUM of $481 billion was up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 11% year-over-year, driven by $18 billion of inflows, which Scott detailed, and solid investment performance, partially offset by higher realizations. We declared a dividend of $0.50 per share, in line with our previous guidance, as we continue to glide path to our new fixed dividend policy. We retained excess DE of approximately $500 million for continued growth opportunities, which funded our investments of approximately $350 million in the quarter in Motive and Challenger. We expect the fourth quarter dividend, paid in February, to reflect our new dividend policy of $0.40 per quarter or $1.60 per year. Our net balance sheet value in the third quarter increased to $5.1 billion, up from $4.8 billion in the second quarter, and our cash on hand increased to $2.1 billion. Additionally, we expect to exceed the $4 DE per share guidance for 2021 that we communicated on our prior earnings call, in light of the $3.51 DE per share we've reported year-to-date. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by reiterating how much we all enjoyed the opportunity to outline our strategic vision and financial targets at our recent Investor Day. We feel confident in achieving our base plan over the next 5 years, which includes growing fee-related revenue by 2.25x driven by growth in AUM and capital solutions; FRE by 2.5x due to positive operating leverage; and SRE by 1.75x, as the retirement services platforms continue to scale with the benefit of third-party capital. Overall, our goal is to more than double our DE to more than $9 per share by 2026, even before driving accretion from investing $5 billion of growth capital or executing share repurchases. We hope our strong Q3 results provide you early confidence in our ability to execute on this plan, with trailing 12-month FRE and DE, up 16% and 81% year-over-year, respectively. While certain quarterly or annual periods may show lower or higher growth, particularly as we wrap up our accelerated investments across the platform, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goal of 18% compound growth in FRE and 60%-plus margins over the next 5 years. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Mike, it's Martin. So we spoke to mandates, which were specific in the quarter to high-grade alpha, but this has been a focus of ours for a long time. And we have over $30 billion in mandates across the platform today, and that number continues to increase as we bring new mandates on, which are customized for individual LPs and provide access to investments across the platform. Yes, Bill, it's Martin. So that earnings related to our investment in Venerable, which was the variable annuity platform that we set up some years back, it was not an intercompany sale. We sold to fund investors into Athora. And it was -- this was a great investment, and it was something that was ultimately not intended to be part of the Apollo ecosystem. And so we realized a great return, and we're recycling that capital back into other uses."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah. Good morning. It's my pleasure to start out and outline another quarter of very strong results. DE for the quarter was $1.71 per share, our highest quarter on record. FRE of $300 million or $0.68 a share, very strong performance. FRE for the first 9 months, $2.01 per share, up 16% year-over-year for the same period. And as you will hear from Scott, we're seeing strong momentum across all fronts, whether it's investment, deployment, realization or fundraising. Year-to-date organic Athene inflows plus third-party fundraising were $44 billion, and we expect them to exceed $55 billion for the year. Importantly, this will be a record year of organic growth at Athene; and, equally as important, this will be a record year of fundraising in a non-flagship year for Apollo, and this again is despite headwinds from the end of 2020. We are well positioned to execute on our long-term targets and deliver for our shareholders. Let me now pivot from the quarter and focus on next year and the next 5 years. Two weeks ago, many of you endured 5 hours of us walking you through our strategic plan. We enjoyed the opportunity to share our road map and to show you how we are positioned to drive the business forward. Rather than rehearse or repeat 5 hours' worth of material, for those who are interested, let's hit the cliff notes. We're in a growth business, driven by the need for retirement income in an anemic market. Our addressable market is the largest among our alternative peers focused, in particular, on fixed income replacement. Athene is a competitive differentiator and a growth accelerant. Our model is highly capital efficient, and I will focus a little bit on this quarter's activities and show you just how efficient. And we have a strong momentum behind a fully aligned industry-leading team and continue to add amazing talent. A reminder, our business is not about just scale. It is not about AUM. It is about delivering excess return per unit of risk to our clients. That is the promise of alternatives. And so long as we do that, we will continue to grow. And the reminder to everyone in our firm is that AUM growth is the reward for good performance. It is not the goal. As many of you took away from the 5-hour dialogue, our plan embeds 3 key bets. One, an expansion into retail following the democratization of finance; the second, growth in capital solutions; and the third, direct origination and scaling of direct origination from roughly $80 billion on an annual basis run rate this year to $150 billion 5 years out. While progress was made against all 3 objectives, this quarter was all about origination with numerous platform additions within our ecosystem. The team, led by Chris Edson, is laser-focused on continuing to scale our origination, which ultimately is 1 of the drivers of growth in our fixed income replacement business and our yield business. Just to highlight 3 additions to our ecosystem announced or closed this quarter. The first was MaxCap. MaxCap is an Australian CRE, financier and fund manager. The second is Newfi. Newfi is a technology-driven multichannel mortgage lender. And the third is Wheels, which will be merged with our existing Donlin fleet platform, creating combined fleet business with $5 billion of pro forma assets and 550,000 customers. Each of these 3 will drive significant amounts of investment-grade, private and spread enhancing origination. Origination, and the ability to find spread without taking on increased risk, is the driver to success in our yield business. Importantly, none of the capital to add to these 3 platforms or to acquire these 3 platforms was required from the Apollo Holding Company. As many of you who teamed into our Investor Day understand, we run an incredibly capital efficient business and are able to scale these origination platforms without capital from the holding company, leaving us free to deploy that capital towards growth initiatives or to return to shareholders. In summary, our business is changing rapidly. Markets, rates and technology and democratization of finance are all sources of this change. Rather than fear this change, we embrace this change. We're going to continue to lead into technology and innovation and capitalize on these disruptive trends. The platform continues to attract incredibly high-quality talent, and I'd highlight just 2 for this quarter. First, Bill Lewis, joining us as Senior Partner and a member of Apollo's management committee; and the second, Dave Stangis, our new Chief Sustainability Officer, also a member of Apollo's Management Committee. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott to review the quarter in more detail. It's Marc. I'll expand on it for 1 second. Martin is right, he's given you all the numbers, but let me kind of describe what it is we're trying to do. Strategic mandate definitionally is with a large account who's prepared to invest across the platform. But what is it they're trying to achieve? Really what they're trying to achieve is alignment. And so we are a pro forma for the merger with Athene, an immense investor in our own products. There is nothing more comforting for another large strategic account than to have us invested side-by-side. I think you will see us more and more emphasize the notion of alignment, both in the fixed income area and increasingly in the equity area, as no other firm will have the kind of alignment and, therefore, investment in products side by side with our clients that we will pro forma. First, thanks for tuning after suffering through 5 hours. But I guess I'd give you the following perspective. The thing that's in short supply is assets. Yes, building out [supply] is assets. Yes, building out and reaching a retail channel is -- requires effort and requires infrastructure. But ultimately, every asset that offers a good risk/reward has a home. There is no shortage of capital to find those assets. To reach a retail audience, one needs the retail audience to accept some amount of illiquidity. That is ultimately what moving into an alternative is. Increasingly, we've seen better acceptance of high net worth and retail investors of this amount of illiquidity, whether it's a private BDC, a private REIT or a true alternative in terms of the equity area. The big firms, the traditional asset managers that are buying in, in many ways, are simply validating what's there, which is the traditional markets cannot offer sustainable alpha and sustainable outperformance. And so they are recognizing that they have to go and purchase that. Ultimately, this trend -- the ability of a retail firm to distribute these products will depend in part on their -- the capacity of their retail system. Many of these traditional retail systems are not set up to offer illiquid products. And so everyone is essentially building toward this market in retail. But I come back to the place I started. Generating assets that offer attractive risk/rewards is ultimately the key to success. They will go to retail. They will go to institutional. They will go to capital solutions. They will go to retirement services balance sheets. And we want to serve all of those. We currently serve 3 of those very well, and we're building on the fourth. And Bill, it's Marc. I'll probably just expand on it. Venerable was a private entity that Apollo, Athene and 2 other private equity firms bought -- created really some number of years ago in connection with the acquisition of Voya's Variable Annuity business. In our view, Variable is not a great product to be part of a public company, given the inherent volatility of GAAP results if business is run properly. Having said that, it's been an amazing investment, all around. In the last year, a second block of business was added in connection with the Equitable transaction. And Equitable became an investor in the platform, side by side with the existing private equity firms and with Apollo and with Athene. At the Equitable mark, Apollo sold its position in Venerable to 1 of its funds and to Athora. There was obviously demand from other entities, including the other private equity firms, for that same stake. But this -- again, this was a great investment, and it's a great tool to have in our toolbox to offer the industry complete solutions in connection with delevering their insurance and retirement services balance sheets, but it is not a permanent part of Apollo on a recurring basis. In short, no. I mean one of the interesting things about Athene is Athene was started, as you know, in 2008 and 2009, and therefore, acquired a set of liabilities at a point in time when interest rates were very low and when there was pretty good understanding of where accounting was going. And so we, at Apollo, have been on top of, and Athene has been on top of, the setting up of the reserves at each point in time. And Athene has its call tomorrow. And I think it would be a good question for you to ask them about the LDTI and specifically, the percentage of their business that is -- comes with writers and other forms of variability versus the industry. And you'll, I believe, receive a very satisfactory answer. In short, no. I think it is difficult. I think as I mentioned -- it's Marc, by the way. As we mentioned on Investor Day, this is a multipronged opportunity. And the easiest is to understand is cost. Obviously, moving securitizations from their current form to blockchain is an information advantage and a cost advantage. Its AUM, providing our capacity to accept large amounts of committed yield in the origination area to FinTech Challengers, should be a source of AUM growth and is -- takes up a considerable amount of our time. Investing in and benefiting from the fintech ecosystem with us as a large customer and as a large financial institution is also part of the playbook. But I think you should think about this very holistically. Technology is going to impact every part of our business. Ultimately, you'll see it probably first in Capital Solutions, which is the business that Craig Farr runs. Today, that business runs a salesperson to salesperson. It will not surprise you that we believe it will ultimately run linked to link. And it will be just a much more efficient way and someone will -- an investor will be able to enter an Apollo ecosystem and decide how to invest and where to invest in addition to the traditional methods. That does not mean that funds and fundraising are going to disappear quite the contrary. I think this is for a certain set of products and a certain set of institutions. But I do think innovation and change are coming to our corner of the industry. And I, for one, welcome it."

This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.

Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in any Apollo Fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Mintzberg, Head of Investor Relations.\nPeter Mintzberg: Thanks, operator. Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO and Co-COO. I'd like to turn it over to Marc to kick off his comments for today. \nMarc Rowan: Thanks Peter. Good morning to all. Pleasure to be here. Q2 '21 was a particularly strong quarter for Apollo. Business as you saw from our results is performing well across all metrics. Record quarterly FRE of $0.68 a share, the highest DE since 2013 of $1.14 per share strong and performance across the PE portfolio, up 9.5%, credit up 2.6%. The numbers speak for themselves. And Jim and Martin, I don't want to steal their thunder, they will review specifics of the quarter with you. In terms of other corporate housekeeping, our merger timing with Athene is on track. We expect that to close in January of '22. During the quarter, we continue to make progress across the governance and cultural enhancements. We welcome David Simon to our board. As we are on track to simplify our voting structure in connection with the merger that would again will happen in January of '22. For those who didn't see it, we recently published our 12th edition of our annual ESG report detailing how we take a holistic approach across all of the communities we operate in, and how important this is to our franchise. We also announced during the quarter our commitment to all finance and important initiative designed to diversify the alternative industry and expand opportunity to historically black colleges and universities. Additionally, during the quarter, the key person clauses in our private equity business have been satisfactorily approved and addressed. Having gotten through the housekeeping, let me do as I often do on these calls, take a step back and look at the big picture. The demand for our end product, access return remains incredibly strong. Drivers of this are persistently low rates, a growing retirement market, both for retail and institutional. Importantly, the disappearance of spread in almost any form in public markets. And the democratization of access to alternative credit and equity across other channels than historically have been available. We have positioned the firm. And the way we go to market is our ability to generate excess return alpha at all points across the risk reward spectrum. We view this as our competitive advantage. We view this as our rationale. We are in the alpha generation business rather than the collection of AUM for the purpose of collecting AUM. Across our opportunistic franchise and our hybrid franchise, we approach this in a contrarian, value oriented mentality with a proven track record over a variety of market cycles over 31 years. And the results as you've seen previously are spectacular. In Yield, the largest of our segments, this is a fixed income replacement business. This is not an opportunistic credit business. Our goal in our yield segment is to produce 150 to 200 basis points of excess return over the equivalent CUSIP across the capital structure. We want to get paid in our yield business for illiquidity and complexity and origination, not for taking additional credit risk, or assuming other risks that we do not intend. Again, stepping back, as we've said previously, in the broadest terms, over the next five years, I expect our yield business to double. And I expect our opportunistic and our hybrid business to be 50% larger. I believe this will take place without any significant acquisitions in our asset management segment. Although, as you will see, and Martin will address, we have ample capital to accelerate our growth if we find interesting opportunities. Last year, we added 300 people to our 1,300 person base. This year, we will add between 300 and 400 people. And I am confident that we will end the year position to support and accelerate growth into 2022. I don't want to take too much away from strategy, but I will step back and now talk a little bit about strategy as we are fortunate to be in a growth business. Almost every day the business gets better. The trends in the business are overwhelmingly favorable. And we look forward to providing you an in-depth perspective on our business and our go forward strategy at an Investor Day, which we will announce which we expect to take place in the month of October. In advance of Investor Day, I want to touch on a couple of building blocks which I've mentioned previously. In order for us to double the yield business and increase the opportunistic and hybrid business by 50%, we need to do a couple of things. First and foremost, is to expand our capacity to generate investments, origination. Second is to strengthen our distribution capabilities, particularly in our hybrid and opportunistic segments. And third and a relatively new area for us to touch on, but one that consumes a lot of our time and mindshare is to prepare the company for the innovation and change that is taking place across the financial services landscape. Make no mistake the innovations we are seeing in FinTech which have taken place across trading markets, and other types of markets are coming to alternative finance. We view this as a significant opportunity rather than a threat, as I believe we are well prepared for it. And I believe our industry, given that it moves relatively quickly, will be well positioned to take advantage of this. Let me start by a review of origination. A lot of what I read, particularly in the analysts commentary, and even ourselves, we talk about the permanent nature of our capital, so called perpetual capital. I think of origination as perpetual asset origination. We want each year not to have to start from zero. We want to be able to count on recurring asset origination opportunities across our yield business, because the demand for yield product is going up, and 100% of what we originate has a home. This quarter, we made significant progress in the origination. We announced a significant relationship with Victory Park which will give us access on a senior basis to the growth and technology lending space. And we announced the acquisition of Foundation Mortgage, a UK based mortgage lender, you should expect to see us make additional announcements with respect to our origination franchises over the remainder of the quarter. We are and the industry is short origination. The capacity to originate, the expansion of our capacity to originate is key to our growth, particularly across our yield business. As it relates to these alternative distribution channels, again, significant progress was made during the quarter, we expect to have a fully ramped up retail distribution business in place for the launch of Fund IX as well as certain credit products toward the end of this year. And we expect retail to be a significant part of our go forward strategy, which I know Jim will spend some time on in his remarks. Let me hit on this other topic of innovation and change coming to our landscape. Apollo, one of our key strengths is in financial services, not just in the growth of our retirement services businesses, but in banking, in lending, in origination. Our business as I said is evolving. And we like our peers are ourselves a large financial institution. Changes are coming to the way products are distributed. Changes are way coming to the way we securitize and the way markets function. And changes are coming to the way we originate assets. All of these things as I said, we welcome. I believe these plays toward our strength, rather than something that we should be concerned about. During the quarter, we announced two significant ventures, one with Motive, which is a strategic investment to help position us at the forefront of FinTech and technological innovation. And the second with Figure, which is a strategic collaboration to implement blockchain, across the investment lifecycle, particularly focused on securitization. These are not pie in the sky. These are real, tangible things that will have immediate cost benefits, data collection benefits and other benefits to our business. Away from the three things I mentioned, a lot of interesting opportunities during the quarter, you will hear and I will steal a little bit of Athene thunder. There is a robust stream of growth in retirement services across the platform. This year, we expect to originate at Athene north of $30 billion on an organic basis. And if trends continue, could be as much as $35 billion. Further, we made a significant minority investment joining Athene in taking a stake in Challenger. Challenger looks an awful lot like Apollo and Athene But in a fast growing and really interesting Australian market. They are both an originator of assets, as well as the largest provider of annuity product in the Australian market. Before I turn it to Jim and Martin, I just want to make it clear, there is just incredible momentum across the platform. This is internal and this is external. We are laying the groundwork for first and exciting Investor Day, but also looking very much forward to completing the merger with Athene beginning of '22 and a very strong '22. We are seeing the tangible benefits of the cultural initiatives we put in place. Our workforce is engaged, excited, and wants to be back in the office. With that my pleasure to turn the call over to my partner James Zelter. \nJames Zelter: Thanks Marc. And thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to echo Marc sentiment; we continue to deliver strong results across all key metrics. And we expect the momentum to continue and build as we make tangible progress on our growth focused agenda. Strategic growth is at the forefront of everything we do, but we are still maintaining a strong focus on execution as our quarterly results demonstrate. As Marc highlighted, overall investment performance remains strong, with a PE portfolio of 9.5% in the quarter and the credit portfolio is up 2.6%. In private equity, Fund IX is leading the way with exceptional performance, driving a gross IRR of 49% and 28% net with a gross MOIC of 1.5x. In credit, with spreads tight, we have been moving up in credit quality and finding returns to superior asset selection and origination. We've seen particularly strong performance out of a Core IV with appreciation 20% to the first half of the year, including 8% in the second quarter. Elsewhere within the opportunistic side of the business, our inaugural hybrid value fund is delivering strong performance with a gross IRR of 29% and 23% net. Moving to our deployment results. Our ability to find attractive investment opportunities, even during periods of elevated valuations has proven both critical and fruitful. Total deployment across the platform, up $28 billion was a quarterly record. In our private equity business, our drawdown funds invested $5 billion and have additional commitments to invest a further $6 billion as of quarter end, including Fund IX investments in Yahoo and Employee Bridge. Yesterday, our private equity business announced a 7.5 billion carve out of Lumen's ILEC business across 20 states with a strategy to bring faster, more reliable internet service to underserved markets and accelerate upgrades to fiber connectivity. This draws on our telecom and infrastructure expertise. And we'll have a management team in place which helped build Verizon's successful BIOS network. Through this investment, we're excited to help bridge the digital divide in America with a transaction that aligns well with our strategy, sourcing value oriented investments with aspects of complete that represent transformational opportunities as a corporate carve out. Including Lumen, Fund IX is now 72% committed or invested. Given the current deployment outlook and the robust IX returns, we expect to be fundraising for Fund X in the first half of next year. Our vision for the hybrid value platform is materializing as planned, with a very active pipeline of transactions as companies are increasingly seeking flexible, bespoke capital solutions. Hybrid Value Fund I s nearly fully deployed, and we expect to begin deploying from Fund II-VI in the very near term. We also signed our first GP solutions transaction this quarter, in conjunction with our hybrid value franchise. In our credit franchise, deployment and origination was also very strong at $19 billion during the quarter, our highest since the fourth quarter of '19. We have remained defensively positioned this year in comparison where we were a year ago and continue to focus on idiosyncratic opportunities and individual names. Mid cap, CLOs and our commercial real estate debt businesses all have strong origination quarters, contributing $10 billion on total credit deployment. Additionally, our aviation business completed a $1 billion aircraft related origination volume during the quarter, our most active quarter in years. This deal volume coincided with the final close of our inaugural aviation drawdown fund navigator, which showcases our ability to leverage our industry expertise into a retail dedicated product. As we look forward, our origination pipeline remains strong across mid cap, Europe and aviation to name a few areas. On the monetization front, we realized very strong returns for our fund investors during the quarter. We return $9 billion of capital, up significantly from the prior year period. The private equity flywheel is very much in motion. We have entered a robust realization cycle encompassing two flagship funds. At the same time, we expect sizeable monetization activities in Fund XIII, IX to be balanced with a continued and healthy deployment activity. Turning to growth and assets under management, recall that our business generates inflows in a variety of ways. We have our institutional fundraising channel, our emerging global Wealth Management Solutions platform, the consistent and strong growth coming from through our retirement services clients, namely Athene as well as inorganic growth potential across the platform. While this mix can vary year-to-year, depending on opportunity, as well as the timing of certain products in the market. The breadth and depth of our platform ensures attractive growth across time. As such inflows for the second quarter were $12 billion bringing total inflows for the first half of the year to $26 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate inflows of approximately $50 billion, driven by $30 billion or more of inflows from Athene, as Marc mentioned, and approximately $20 billion of inflows from our third party institutional and wealth management businesses at the high end of our previously communicated $15 billion to $20 billion targeted range. Not surprisingly, organic growth trends at Athene remain very favorable and appear to be accelerating with particular strength in year-to-date funding agreement banknote issuance and pension risk transfer activity, where they just announced a $5 billion transaction yesterday. In our third party institutional business, we've had strong engagement with fund investors on both existing and new products. And for example, we are making strong tangible progress on our capital raise of our $1 billion plus inaugural impact fund. We also plan to be in the market for our inaugural accord plus fund, a new multi asset class opportunistic credit product this fall. As we discussed earlier this year, we see tremendous growth opportunity potential in the high net worth in mass affluent markets, given its increasing sophistication, and are investing heavily to capitalize on this long term opportunity through our dedicated Global Wealth Management Solutions platform. We are approaching the opportunity with a leading brand name and investment track record establishing targeted distribution and tailoring products so that the individual investors globally can access our strategies across the risk reward spectrum. We are also focusing on how education, technology and client service will shape our approach. In addition to hiring ahead of US distribution, we built out a team to cover the US private banks and warehouses, including wholesalers with coverage across the country, as well as national account professionals. We have plans to continue to add professionals in the US and internationally as we build out our global footprint. The independent channel is also a priority for us as we look to expand our existing coverage. We're focused on deepening our partnership across Wealth Management channels, globally through the distribution of our qualified purchaser strategies, including but not limited to our large scale direct origination, hybrid value and PE. But additionally, we're also contemplating several accredited strategies, including several semi liquid private credit opportunities. Historically, approximately 94% of Apollo's third party inflows have come from the institutional channel. But we're actively working to change that mix. In three to five years, we believe the contribution from the wealth management channel will be a material part of our third party inflows, given the vast opportunity in the $55 trillion plus global retail market. As a reminder, Athene already access as part of the retail market via its retirement services product offering. We believe the alignment we are creating with our upcoming merger will help expand their retail network as well. You'll likely notice that we had a very strong transaction advisory fees in the second quarter, including $55 million of fees from the credit business. These results reflect our ability to source and distribute large scale credit as we have made growing our high grade alpha origination pipeline, our strategic priority. One of the largest transactions this quarter was per Hertz, which follows other successful transactions over the past year, including ADNOC and AB InBev. Alongside our efforts in large cap lending, we have been very focused on developing our capital solutions platform. This quarter we made several key hires to help scale our centralized origination, structuring and distribution platform. And we are confident that we will continue to see significant acceleration of this market opportunity and feel comfortable that our business will grow. As Marc touched upon, we announced several strategic investments this quarter, which we believe will bolster our front end origination capabilities longer term. Continuing to invest and growing these front end origination platform is a key tenet of our growth strategy, so you should expect us to announce additional investments to further broaden the platform. Our recently announced partnership with Victory Park will give us access to proprietary origination in the ecommerce financing markets. Additionally, Athene acquisition of Foundation home loans will complement our expanding asset sourcing in the residential mortgage space in the UK, we expect that businesses will be multiple -- both of these will be multiple billion asset originators for Athene's balance sheet, and our institutional investors over the coming several years. As part of our broader innovation agenda, we announced two key investments this quarter, Motor partners and Figure. We are embracing technology as another way to expand our origination and distribution capabilities and to help put us at the forefront of advancement and disruption across financial services. Additionally, we believe that the broad adoption of blockchain to materially reduce back office operating expenses and presents additional revenue synergy upside.  In conclusion, we are making substantial investments across our credit and opportunistic businesses, as well as our enterprise solutions platform to take advantage of the opportunity set in various growth markets. We have shown meaningful progress on expanding our capabilities and footprint in the first half of the year. And you should expect to see us continue to make additional announcements in the coming months. With that, I'll turn over to my partner Martin. \nMartin Kelly: Thanks Jim. In the second quarter, as you've heard, Apollo recorded very strong results across all key financial and operating metrics. We generated FRE of $0.68 per share on a pretax basis. On dollar basis FRE increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 16% year-over-year, driven by growth in management fees and an uptick in transaction and advisory fees. Fee related earnings exceeded $300 million for the first time, illustrating our continued progress in growing this highly valuable earnings stream. Management fees grew 3% sequentially and 15% over the prior year quarter driven by the growth of our retirement services clients as well as strong investing activity across our platform broadly. Transaction and advisory fees were $83 million in the quarter, up $28 million over the prior quarter and totaled $139 million over the first half of the year.  These strong results reflect the build out of our large cap lending business; including a significant financing transaction with Hertz and co invest capital for the Michaels transaction within Fund IX. Compensation expense was up 4% over the prior quarter, largely driven by the strategic hiring activity Marc discussed earlier. These additional resources are critical to support the abundant growth opportunities in front of us, as well as to position the platform for increased efficiency in the future. Looking forward, we expect compensation expenses will continue to trend higher, reflecting this hiring investment. However, we remain confident that this cost growth will be managed in line with our long term mid teens or better FRE growth expectations. Non compensation costs increased $18 million sequentially due to higher recruitment costs and occupancy expenses as we expand our global real estate footprint to adequately accommodate our growing team. Turning to DE, for the second quarter, we generated after tax distributable earnings of $1.14 per share, supported both by our strong and consistent pretax FRE, a net incentive earnings of $0.58 per share. Behind the strength of private equity realization activity during the quarter, we recognize $222 million of net carry, notable transactions including LifePoint Health, Forraya, Double Eagle Energy, Apollo Education Group and OneMain Financial among others. From the quarter's DE, we announced a dividend of $0.50 per share. We retained excess cash earnings to invest in growing the new platforms that Mike and Jim both described. The aggregate investment by Apollo and affiliates in these platforms across the second and third quarters amounted to approximately $1 billion. As we evaluate additional investment opportunities with our upcoming change in dividend policy post merger, we're on a glide path to his new approach and expect a similar $0.50 per share dividend in the third quarter before the new $0.40 per share dividend takes effect after the merger closes. As Jim mentioned, we've entered a robust realization cycle that we believe will provide sustained and meaningfully higher realizations. In the near term, and as evidence of this, we expect to report 2021 full year after tax DE of over $4 per share. Based on activity to date in the third quarter, we have already realized pretax net carry of approximately $0.50 per share. When you consider Apollo is ramping incentive earnings paired with strong and growing FRE and further combined with the attractive growth and earnings profile at Athene, the earnings growth and capital generation characteristics are very powerful. Turning to AUM; we ended the second quarter at $472 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year, driven by third party fundraising, organic growth from Athene as well as portfolio appreciation and partly offset by strong PE realization activity. Fee generating AUM of $354 billion was up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year. Dry powder for investments across our fund complex totaled $48 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $25 billion has the potential to drive management fees once invested. S&P recently published the annual report on Apollo and upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive. Our net economic balance sheet after debt and preferred stock was approximately $11 per share as of June 30, increasing nearly $3 per share quarter-over-quarter. To echo both Mike and Jim, we are pleased with the impressive results this quarter. And we expect the strong business momentum demonstrated in the first half of the year to continue. Looking forward, we are focused on executing our growth strategy, including via our announced merger with Athene. In order to lay out our growth strategy in more detail, especially as it pertains to the upcoming merger, we will be hosting an Investor Day in October. And we hope many of you will be able to reconnect with us in person for this important event. We expect to have a very targeted agenda centered on several key focus points, including the growth strategy of our combined business, the financial construction and earning streams of our combined company as well as our earnings profile and capital allocation expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Mintzberg:  Thank you, Martin. That concludes our remarks for today. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.\nAlexBlostein: Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So in the prepared remarks, I heard lots of growth initiatives really across a pretty wide spectrum of initiatives, which is great to hear on top of Athene, I guess, taking a step back, can you help us maybe with a framework and sort of the growth algorithm for management fees outside of the insurance partnerships, call it over the next two years, especially as realizations from private equity vintages start to accelerate.\nMarcRowan: Maybe, it's Marc, maybe I'll provide a framework for it, and then turn it to Martin and to Jim to fill in. So broadly, what we've said, and again, we will be more specific in Investor Day, we expect our yield business to double. And we expect our opportunistic and hybrid business to be 50%, larger over the next five years. That is a doubling of the business, doubling of FRE, doubling of AUM and that is without significant acquisitions, or any real acquisitions, from the capital that we have accumulated in the capital that we will accumulate at the combined entity. So I think that provides at least some backdrop and framework for how we're going to grow. I'll dig into a little bit on without Athene question. And this will carry over to remarks I expect from other questions. 100% of any asset that we originate in the yield business has a home. In fact, 150% of any asset that we originate in the yield business has a home, we as an asset manager, have a choice. And that choice is do we derive a pure asset management fee from that? Or do we derive a pure asset management fee plus spread related earnings? What we have done and what the merger with Athene reiterate is that we believe given that asset scarcity is the limited on our growth in the yield business rather than liability accumulation, we should earn as much money as possible from assets that we originate. That does not mean at the expense of third party business, because we can't take concentrated positions on to a retirement services balance sheet. But and so what we have done is we have built an expanding ecosystem of similarly situated companies, all of whom face the same challenge that Athene and others face, which is the absence of spread in public markets. So long as we increase the origination capacity, 100% of those assets have a home, they can go onto Athene and Athora's balance sheet, they can go to third parties, they can go as we've already suggested into a mix, as opposed to looking at it as one or the other. So Jim, Martin?\nJamesZelter: No, I would echo that I think, well, what we've -- a great example, Alex, is the high grade alpha where those transactions were very -- were critical, and Athene or Athora or other insurance balance sheets with the lead buyer, but a combination of other third parties augmented that demand side, so they go hand in hand, the growth goes hand in hand, the creation and the development of these origination goes hand in hand. And certainly we look at them as multi year growth. The critical aspect is the origination angle. But the balance sheets of the insurance companies as well as third party institutions grow and certainly as you grow wealth management, that retail democratization will be at the trough as well.\nMarcRowan: Maybe I'll just -- I'll close out because I think we're -- one point that I do want to emphasize the go-to-market strategy asset origination is key. But it also is followed by alignment. There is nothing more reassuring to a third party client, then the affiliated balance sheet owns the same security and size same time same price. That is in fact a unique selling proposition and why in particular in things like high grade alpha and we expect other areas. We will see significant growth in third party business side by side with Athene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nGlennSchorr: Hi, thanks. Maybe we can continue the conversation on the origination side. So I hear you loud and clear 100% of the assets originate at home. So my questions are, and I know that may we'll talk generically because each one's probably different. We look at something like Victory Park or the UK mortgage lender. What percentage of their production are you getting? Who controls the underwriting? Is it exclusive? And does Apollo take on any risk in these transactions? I know the assets are going in the funds. But I know that's a lot, but I want to learn more. Thanks. \nMarcRowan: Okay. So first, Glenn, thank you. These are not your droids either. Just to show you that we actually, we could publish. But let's come back to what origination is. Origination gives us control of documentation. It gives us control of diligence. It gives us control of structure. And it gives us improved economics. But one thing it does not give us is liquidity. We think that is the right trade off for a fixed income replacement business, which are the general characteristics of our yield business. There is no one size fits all with respect to the platform. But the reason to do this is to control the credit process and the diligence process and not expose yourself to undue risks. In some of the platforms and I won't just stop there because there are Donlin, PK Aviation, mid cap, net lease, and a number of others. In some of the platforms we derive as Apollo or as the broader Apollo, Athene and third party management ecosystem 100% of the production.  In others, we also securitize and participate in capital markets, at least for a portion. This is all about optimization of the specific risk reward in platforms we own, and platforms we partner with, which is another way for us to acquire a platform. Now let Jim address what we do with Victory Park.\nJamesZelter: So what Marc just described is what we have with the names he mentioned, including Foundation where we'll take all those assets, put them onto our insurance or other balance sheets, and then the ongoing flow will exclusively come to us because we in essence, control and own that platform. Victory Park different; Victory Park, they have really spent a number of years really fine tuning their financing and funding to the growing expansion of online financial retail distribution. And in that case, we are a partner with that firm where we provide a senior facility, and they are the junior debt and equity underneath us. There is some alignment between warrants or otherwise. But again, we are aligning to their flow because as the ecosystem of finance and funding has evolved in the last 10 years, there are certain firms that are really connected with the consumer in other ways than traditional bank lending. And so we want to be the financing partner to those firms. And in those situations where we don't control all the aspects that Marc said, the ultimate control we have is to open or tighten the flow of product over a quarterly basis. So what we've actually found is the flexibility to go from 100% control to align partner around the US and around the globe. That's really allows us to create that incremental spread on that on that fixed income alternative is that Marc talked about. \nMarcRowan: And more broadly, Glenn, just to come back to this again, we as an industry, and often particularly we spent a lot of time talking about perpetual capital, we really are interested in perpetual asset origination. We need to start each year understanding that we have the capacity to generate significant amounts of yield the assets appropriate for the client base, internal and third party that we have elected to serve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley.\nMichaelCyprys: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Marc, I guess with nearly a year or half year under your belt running the firm. Can you just talk about how you are improving the governance structure of the firm? How the board structure is evolving? How are you seeing the culture of the firm evolving here? And can you also touch upon the key person point that you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks that was satisfied and address? Thank you.\nMarcRowan: Sure, let me work backwards. The key person again, I think as Scott suggested in his remarks last quarter, the PE franchise is a franchise that has been well institutionalized. The team that oversees our private equity business have Matt Nord and David Sambur have really been the primary contributors for the past three funds, the results in the business are nothing short of spectacular as you heard this morning, then the notion just to step back that a $25 billion fund is up high 40s, gross and high 20s net. And such a strong MOIC is itself astounding, almost sounds like venture numbers. So I do not believe that we really ever thought that this was an issue, and it simply reflects the evolution and maturation of the franchise where those people who are most important to the franchise are now I'll say key men, but I really mean key person, because that's increasingly where we're going. And those who are less important to the franchise, or are moving on as in Josh's case, are no longer key people. So not an issue. Culture is a big area of focus. So when I divided the tasks with my two partners, Scott and Jim, I said what you would expect, as CEO I get to choose first. So I'd like to do strategy, culture, communication, and dealing with problems. And I left most everything else to the two of them, including the day to day running of the business. But culture is key. Internally, Apollo's culture has really always worked. I mean I give these statistics but it sometimes it's helpful just to reframe it.  We started 2020 as 1,300 person firm. We added 300 people remotely during 2020. And turnover went down, we will add between 300 and 400 people and turnover is trending down. What we have built internally is the most collegial, the most integrated, the most entrepreneurial model. And I believe all of those things we need to do and we need to double down on. Having said that, we also need to recognize that the world is changing and markets are changing. Increasingly, our business by population is comprised of FRE generation businesses around yield. That requires a different set of compensation tools, a different culture and a different approach. And we are evolving rather than radically changing. The momentum in this place is palpable, and it feels great.  I'll just add I want to not leave it unsaid. Governance is also a transition. As I previously noted on calls, our entire industry is going through an evolution, the evolution started, we all pretty much started as private equity only Private limited partnerships. Those firms that were successful in those activities and institutionalize their business God trusted with more capital, those that also did well, with more capital got to broaden the strategies. And once you got to that a number of the firms sufficiently as institutionalized were successful and going public. That generation of founders will turn over. I know some don't think that will happen, but inevitably will happen. We are the first of the large firms really to go through that wholesale transition, not just at a management level, but at the governance level and a shareholding level. As I said, somewhat jokingly, I believe others will do it less noisily than we have. But it does feel good to be on the other side of that. The business functions normally, we function with the board as any public company would function with the board. And there's just no impediment to what we're doing. We will lay out in Investor Day, alongside the topics that Martin discussed our approach to governance, and also approach to compensation and some of these cultural initiatives going forward. But it does feel really good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup.\nBillKatz: Okay, thanks very much taking the question, and good morning, everybody. You guys are going pretty quick in terms of what you're doing on the retail side. So wondered if you could give sort of maybe your recap where we are today? And as you look into 2022, it sounds like maybe where like the early opportunities might sit in terms of capital rising? Thank you.\nJamesZelter: Sure, Bill, it's Jim. So this just a level set. If you look over the last number of years approximately 95% of our fundraising had been through our traditional institutional channels. And we had raised with some -- with a higher net worth that the private banks and a large warehouses, some of our flagship products, whether it was EPF or fund, our PE funds, Those had been a traditional distribution channel for us. Starting actually, in the middle of last year, we embarked on a strategy to dramatically increase our global wealth distribution channel. And we really aligned our senior leadership to allow the next generation to come up and run our institutional business, and proven leadership under St\u00e9phane to really focus on the global wealth channel. So we set it up about a year ago, part of the numbers that Marc and Martin went through about the hiring this year, we've hired a tremendous amount of folks. And so we believe that through the course of this year, we will have a team that can really feel the breadth of distribution across geographies, and products.  So to your next question, a lot of the products we have are just really opening the spigot to what we have today. But it's also creating new products that fit the accredited marketplace. Obviously, we have non traded BDC that we expect to be out in the market in the latter quarters of this year, and to really ramp up in '22 and beyond. But there are a variety of other products in the lab, that we will focus really on the yield and the hybrid products for the mass retail agendas not only in the US, but in Europe and Asia. So that's the three part plan. We all have seen how large the marketplace is, we believe it's a whether the numbers are $40 trillion or $55 trillion; it's a massive total addressable market. We believe our brand, our track record, our product innovation, will be able to conquer our fair share, and go on from there. But it's an exciting growth tool for the firm. And we expect to have our participation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.\nPatrickDavitt: Hi, good morning, everyone. You mentioned the challenger state, could you help us understand a bit better how this could flow through earnings and value for Apollo shareholders? And is the endgame here having another insurance platform like Athene or Athora but in Australia?\nMarcRowan: So it's Marc, I think it will depend; we'll see how it develops. But just to recap, we over a roughly 12 year period, we're a minority shareholder of Athene, and only earlier this year did we decide to bring in 100%. We also have a significant but minority shareholding in Athora and so we look around the world. And there are a bunch of really interesting markets. And this is probably more than you want. But regulatory change and the absence of spread in public markets is creating opportunities in Japan and Taiwan, in Hong Kong and a number of other markets. Some of those markets are best access through reinsurance or through other types of entry strategies. But a market like Australia is best accessed, in our opinion, through a stake holding in an established company with its own strategy, its own regulatory and asset origination capability, and quite frankly, a mentality that is very similar to ours. So I think it's early days. But I'll come back to the growth in the retirement services business is not about liabilities. It is all about assets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW.\nRobertLee: Great, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just going to transaction fees and maybe taking into that a little bit. Obviously, we're -- I've been up a lot. And can you maybe give us a sense, as you ramp the origination capabilities. Now have -- kind of get a good sense, better sense of kind of the linkage of that to origination versus also maybe realization activity. If there's, if you see, as your realization activity ramps up also, if we should see that translate in some ways to the higher transaction fees doing, maybe just figure some of the build up.\nJamesZelter: Sure. So we think about our platform, as the landscape has evolved over the last decade and as our trends -- as our platforms evolve. As Marc and I and Martin have all said, origination is the key to our business. And so the ability for us to source product that we directly originate whether it's in the commercial real estate, residential, real estate, corporate world, it's critical to our long term growth on that spread business. The reality is the scale of our business today, the ecosystem of combining origination, structuring, and then in the need of syndication. It's like a flywheel, the larger transactions you get, there's a thinner universe of folks that can provide those capital solutions for the companies I mentioned Hertz being the one this year. And again, once that flywheel gets going, your ability to be important to borrowers, as well as not only our balance sheets, but third party, institutional clients and other LPs.  It's a critical flywheel. So yes, as we ramp up our bespoke origination in the US, but globally, and our dialogue with all different types of industries expands, you will expect to see larger transaction fees. And as I said, interestingly enough, last year with our success of the transactions, the ADNOC and the AB InBev, our ecosystem with large, US insurers dramatically increased. And not only did they come in for vehicles and SMEs on those types of products, but it expanded back into our business and some of our opportunistic impact infrastructure. And I suspect you'll see a lot more activity on those investors in Fund IX. So the flywheel and the ecosystem are connected. The whole capital solutions, capital markets transactions have worked between all three are inherently connected. And it's a big growth area. And we brought in some great leadership. We think that our capital markets and integrated platform, the fact that we don't have any information barriers between all of our businesses, what's going on in the syndication, syndicated loan market with direct lending, which we've been a big player in with our JV with Mubadala, these are all connected, and you'll see us talk continuously about those in the quarters and Investor Day to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies.\nGerryO'Hara: Great, thanks. Maybe one for Martin. Appreciate the comments kind of around continued investment with respect to comp expense, but also, balanced against mid teens or better FRE growth expectations. And I suspect you'll probably flush a little bit this out during the Investor Day, but can you give us a little bit of a sense of how to think about FRE margin over the next kind of, I guess, six to 12 months? Or longer as it relates to those comments. Thank you.\nMartinKelly: Yes, so Gerry, we're actually -- we're really focused on FRE dollar growth, we're very comfortable with margins where they are, which are sort of low to mid-50s. And investment and building out the platform needs P&L, CapEx, and so you invest now for revenues later. So we are -- we've suggested using the numbers of Marc has outlined on doubling in yield and a 50% growth in opportunistic as sort of as a baseline. That's a 15% FRE growth rate. I would expect that the margin will sort of hold around current levels. And we'll always be investing for future growth opportunities that we see ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP.\nBrianMcKenna: Hi, thanks. This is Brian McKenna for Devin. It's probably a little early, but what are your initial expectations for private equity Fund X fundraising, do you think you'll be able to raise something similar to Fund IX which was about $25 billion? And there are clearly a lot of deployment opportunities across the market today. So how do you think about appropriately capping the fund relative to the current deployment backdrop?\nMartinKelly: That's our working plan. Our working assumption is that we will seek to raise a fund the same size or similar size to that which we have. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS.\nAdamBeatty: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I want to circle back to the third of the three themes that Marc laid out in the opening, specifically FinTech driven change in alternative management. We can infer something from the discussion of Victory Park and some of the other deals, but just wanted to give you the opportunity to frame out what you see as the two or three most important changes. The questions being asked if you will of the alternative management industry by FinTech and you might want to save the answers for later on. Thank you.\nMarcRowan: Look, we'll do a little of this now, but I think there are some of the obvious. First comes to me in balance sheet. Most of the FinTech providers do not want to be the owners of the assets; they want to be the pipe or the originator. And we are an excellent partner for platforms that we trust, whose underwriting we trust with full visibility and full credit, and documentation due diligence. And what you will see us do is what we've been doing backing those who we think are winners, taking stakes, where we think it's important to take a stake, and otherwise facilitating an infrastructure and an ecosystem that generates the kind of fixed income replacement 150 to 200 basis points over comparable and investment grade that we are looking for. And we have a huge appetite for this. And we are a relatively easy partner to work with, and very commercial. The second place is we are a massive user of FinTech services; look at our securitization business, which is the first area that we are attacking with Figure.  This is an opportunity for cost reduction, documentation improvement, debt data gathering speed to market. And I doubt this will be the last of the partnerships that we have in terms of validation of blockchain or other types of services that offer these opportunities. And that's before we start thinking about our own business. Jim alluded to it. But if you think back to Jim's comments on the security, excuse me, the syndication business; the syndication business has existed in its existing form for forever. We generate in a centralized way, a clearinghouse of product, and it's sold salesperson to salesperson. My guess is you will see, over time, some amount of technology applied to that. And the pace of innovation is actually increasing. And what we're seeing is a lot of the most interesting innovation is taking place in the high net worth and ultra high net worth channels first. And I expect that to continue over the near term. And ultimately, to move into the institutional channel. Final thing I would point to is the entire documentation process, the subscription. And signing on for institutional partnerships is surprisingly antiquated. Probably the best word I could find. I think the streamlining of our business, through the use of technology, including through interactions with our investors, is just going to gather steam. But those would, I would say, the mundane, more to come. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citigroup.\nBillKatz: Thanks so much. I think sounds like you are going to spend a lot more time on this in October, so perhaps leave it to then. But you obviously have one insider in particular, that's been selling rather heavily. Just given everything that you're doing in terms of funding growth elsewhere, any opportunity to remove some of that technical overhang, particularly given the overall change among the three original partners.\nMarcRowan: Yes, Bill, this is alternatives that we would do what we can to avoid a significant and persistent selling of stock, obviously subject to agreement, but there are the obvious structural transactions that we can look at to do that. My sense is he is comfortable with what he's done. And as he steps back from the business, he wanted to lighten up a bit. So it's not surprising. But he'll make his own decisions. And if we can facilitate that, then we will.\nOperator: Our next question Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.\nPatrickDavitt: Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow up. The credit performance was pretty outsized for a non 4Q results. So could you give a little bit more color on the driver of that? And in that vein, as we look into 4Q, could you give us an idea of how the hedge funds that drove the big 4Q performance for you last year are tracking relative to last year?\nJamesZelter: Yes, so I'll let Martin get in this detail as well. But whether it was Accord or some of the other products that have continued to do well, Accord is the reminder is the product that has a limited drawdown window 12 to 18 months, and then it's monetized. We're on Accord IV for now. And there's been some great success of that platform over the last three or four years. Hence, the development of the new products, Accord plus which expands it, but that really was probably the key reason on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nMarcRowan: Yes, it was a couple of different funds. But Patrick 90%, plus 90% of the total carry came from PE and that was across portfolio of funds. It's actually interesting that we're seeing the tail end of Fund VII, the Fund VIII to Fund IX and the bulk of the carry coming from Fund VIII and hybrids is contributing as well. So there's each of those funds has a diverse portfolio of investments which are starting to monetize principally in Fund VIII but Fund IX is helping around the hedges and so as we look forward, the main story will be Fund VIII realizations for the next handful of years and then Fund IX should pick up on the back of that in real size. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Jim. In the second quarter, as you've heard, Apollo recorded very strong results across all key financial and operating metrics. We generated FRE of $0.68 per share on a pretax basis. On dollar basis FRE increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 16% year-over-year, driven by growth in management fees and an uptick in transaction and advisory fees. Fee related earnings exceeded $300 million for the first time, illustrating our continued progress in growing this highly valuable earnings stream. Management fees grew 3% sequentially and 15% over the prior year quarter driven by the growth of our retirement services clients as well as strong investing activity across our platform broadly. Transaction and advisory fees were $83 million in the quarter, up $28 million over the prior quarter and totaled $139 million over the first half of the year.  These strong results reflect the build out of our large cap lending business; including a significant financing transaction with Hertz and co invest capital for the Michaels transaction within Fund IX. Compensation expense was up 4% over the prior quarter, largely driven by the strategic hiring activity Marc discussed earlier. These additional resources are critical to support the abundant growth opportunities in front of us, as well as to position the platform for increased efficiency in the future. Looking forward, we expect compensation expenses will continue to trend higher, reflecting this hiring investment. However, we remain confident that this cost growth will be managed in line with our long term mid teens or better FRE growth expectations. Non compensation costs increased $18 million sequentially due to higher recruitment costs and occupancy expenses as we expand our global real estate footprint to adequately accommodate our growing team. Turning to DE, for the second quarter, we generated after tax distributable earnings of $1.14 per share, supported both by our strong and consistent pretax FRE, a net incentive earnings of $0.58 per share. Behind the strength of private equity realization activity during the quarter, we recognize $222 million of net carry, notable transactions including LifePoint Health, Forraya, Double Eagle Energy, Apollo Education Group and OneMain Financial among others. From the quarter's DE, we announced a dividend of $0.50 per share. We retained excess cash earnings to invest in growing the new platforms that Mike and Jim both described. The aggregate investment by Apollo and affiliates in these platforms across the second and third quarters amounted to approximately $1 billion. As we evaluate additional investment opportunities with our upcoming change in dividend policy post merger, we're on a glide path to his new approach and expect a similar $0.50 per share dividend in the third quarter before the new $0.40 per share dividend takes effect after the merger closes. As Jim mentioned, we've entered a robust realization cycle that we believe will provide sustained and meaningfully higher realizations. In the near term, and as evidence of this, we expect to report 2021 full year after tax DE of over $4 per share. Based on activity to date in the third quarter, we have already realized pretax net carry of approximately $0.50 per share. When you consider Apollo is ramping incentive earnings paired with strong and growing FRE and further combined with the attractive growth and earnings profile at Athene, the earnings growth and capital generation characteristics are very powerful. Turning to AUM; we ended the second quarter at $472 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year, driven by third party fundraising, organic growth from Athene as well as portfolio appreciation and partly offset by strong PE realization activity. Fee generating AUM of $354 billion was up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year. Dry powder for investments across our fund complex totaled $48 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $25 billion has the potential to drive management fees once invested. S&P recently published the annual report on Apollo and upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive. Our net economic balance sheet after debt and preferred stock was approximately $11 per share as of June 30, increasing nearly $3 per share quarter-over-quarter. To echo both Mike and Jim, we are pleased with the impressive results this quarter. And we expect the strong business momentum demonstrated in the first half of the year to continue. Looking forward, we are focused on executing our growth strategy, including via our announced merger with Athene. In order to lay out our growth strategy in more detail, especially as it pertains to the upcoming merger, we will be hosting an Investor Day in October. And we hope many of you will be able to reconnect with us in person for this important event. We expect to have a very targeted agenda centered on several key focus points, including the growth strategy of our combined business, the financial construction and earning streams of our combined company as well as our earnings profile and capital allocation expectations. With that, I'll turn the call back to Peter. Yes, so Gerry, we're actually -- we're really focused on FRE dollar growth, we're very comfortable with margins where they are, which are sort of low to mid-50s. And investment and building out the platform needs P&L, CapEx, and so you invest now for revenues later. So we are -- we've suggested using the numbers of Marc has outlined on doubling in yield and a 50% growth in opportunistic as sort of as a baseline. That's a 15% FRE growth rate. I would expect that the margin will sort of hold around current levels. And we'll always be investing for future growth opportunities that we see ahead of us. That's our working plan. Our working assumption is that we will seek to raise a fund the same size or similar size to that which we have."

            "name": "James Zelter",
            "content": "Thanks Marc. And thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to echo Marc sentiment; we continue to deliver strong results across all key metrics. And we expect the momentum to continue and build as we make tangible progress on our growth focused agenda. Strategic growth is at the forefront of everything we do, but we are still maintaining a strong focus on execution as our quarterly results demonstrate. As Marc highlighted, overall investment performance remains strong, with a PE portfolio of 9.5% in the quarter and the credit portfolio is up 2.6%. In private equity, Fund IX is leading the way with exceptional performance, driving a gross IRR of 49% and 28% net with a gross MOIC of 1.5x. In credit, with spreads tight, we have been moving up in credit quality and finding returns to superior asset selection and origination. We've seen particularly strong performance out of a Core IV with appreciation 20% to the first half of the year, including 8% in the second quarter. Elsewhere within the opportunistic side of the business, our inaugural hybrid value fund is delivering strong performance with a gross IRR of 29% and 23% net. Moving to our deployment results. Our ability to find attractive investment opportunities, even during periods of elevated valuations has proven both critical and fruitful. Total deployment across the platform, up $28 billion was a quarterly record. In our private equity business, our drawdown funds invested $5 billion and have additional commitments to invest a further $6 billion as of quarter end, including Fund IX investments in Yahoo and Employee Bridge. Yesterday, our private equity business announced a 7.5 billion carve out of Lumen's ILEC business across 20 states with a strategy to bring faster, more reliable internet service to underserved markets and accelerate upgrades to fiber connectivity. This draws on our telecom and infrastructure expertise. And we'll have a management team in place which helped build Verizon's successful BIOS network. Through this investment, we're excited to help bridge the digital divide in America with a transaction that aligns well with our strategy, sourcing value oriented investments with aspects of complete that represent transformational opportunities as a corporate carve out. Including Lumen, Fund IX is now 72% committed or invested. Given the current deployment outlook and the robust IX returns, we expect to be fundraising for Fund X in the first half of next year. Our vision for the hybrid value platform is materializing as planned, with a very active pipeline of transactions as companies are increasingly seeking flexible, bespoke capital solutions. Hybrid Value Fund I s nearly fully deployed, and we expect to begin deploying from Fund II-VI in the very near term. We also signed our first GP solutions transaction this quarter, in conjunction with our hybrid value franchise. In our credit franchise, deployment and origination was also very strong at $19 billion during the quarter, our highest since the fourth quarter of '19. We have remained defensively positioned this year in comparison where we were a year ago and continue to focus on idiosyncratic opportunities and individual names. Mid cap, CLOs and our commercial real estate debt businesses all have strong origination quarters, contributing $10 billion on total credit deployment. Additionally, our aviation business completed a $1 billion aircraft related origination volume during the quarter, our most active quarter in years. This deal volume coincided with the final close of our inaugural aviation drawdown fund navigator, which showcases our ability to leverage our industry expertise into a retail dedicated product. As we look forward, our origination pipeline remains strong across mid cap, Europe and aviation to name a few areas. On the monetization front, we realized very strong returns for our fund investors during the quarter. We return $9 billion of capital, up significantly from the prior year period. The private equity flywheel is very much in motion. We have entered a robust realization cycle encompassing two flagship funds. At the same time, we expect sizeable monetization activities in Fund XIII, IX to be balanced with a continued and healthy deployment activity. Turning to growth and assets under management, recall that our business generates inflows in a variety of ways. We have our institutional fundraising channel, our emerging global Wealth Management Solutions platform, the consistent and strong growth coming from through our retirement services clients, namely Athene as well as inorganic growth potential across the platform. While this mix can vary year-to-year, depending on opportunity, as well as the timing of certain products in the market. The breadth and depth of our platform ensures attractive growth across time. As such inflows for the second quarter were $12 billion bringing total inflows for the first half of the year to $26 billion. For the full year, we expect to generate inflows of approximately $50 billion, driven by $30 billion or more of inflows from Athene, as Marc mentioned, and approximately $20 billion of inflows from our third party institutional and wealth management businesses at the high end of our previously communicated $15 billion to $20 billion targeted range. Not surprisingly, organic growth trends at Athene remain very favorable and appear to be accelerating with particular strength in year-to-date funding agreement banknote issuance and pension risk transfer activity, where they just announced a $5 billion transaction yesterday. In our third party institutional business, we've had strong engagement with fund investors on both existing and new products. And for example, we are making strong tangible progress on our capital raise of our $1 billion plus inaugural impact fund. We also plan to be in the market for our inaugural accord plus fund, a new multi asset class opportunistic credit product this fall. As we discussed earlier this year, we see tremendous growth opportunity potential in the high net worth in mass affluent markets, given its increasing sophistication, and are investing heavily to capitalize on this long term opportunity through our dedicated Global Wealth Management Solutions platform. We are approaching the opportunity with a leading brand name and investment track record establishing targeted distribution and tailoring products so that the individual investors globally can access our strategies across the risk reward spectrum. We are also focusing on how education, technology and client service will shape our approach. In addition to hiring ahead of US distribution, we built out a team to cover the US private banks and warehouses, including wholesalers with coverage across the country, as well as national account professionals. We have plans to continue to add professionals in the US and internationally as we build out our global footprint. The independent channel is also a priority for us as we look to expand our existing coverage. We're focused on deepening our partnership across Wealth Management channels, globally through the distribution of our qualified purchaser strategies, including but not limited to our large scale direct origination, hybrid value and PE. But additionally, we're also contemplating several accredited strategies, including several semi liquid private credit opportunities. Historically, approximately 94% of Apollo's third party inflows have come from the institutional channel. But we're actively working to change that mix. In three to five years, we believe the contribution from the wealth management channel will be a material part of our third party inflows, given the vast opportunity in the $55 trillion plus global retail market. As a reminder, Athene already access as part of the retail market via its retirement services product offering. We believe the alignment we are creating with our upcoming merger will help expand their retail network as well. You'll likely notice that we had a very strong transaction advisory fees in the second quarter, including $55 million of fees from the credit business. These results reflect our ability to source and distribute large scale credit as we have made growing our high grade alpha origination pipeline, our strategic priority. One of the largest transactions this quarter was per Hertz, which follows other successful transactions over the past year, including ADNOC and AB InBev. Alongside our efforts in large cap lending, we have been very focused on developing our capital solutions platform. This quarter we made several key hires to help scale our centralized origination, structuring and distribution platform. And we are confident that we will continue to see significant acceleration of this market opportunity and feel comfortable that our business will grow. As Marc touched upon, we announced several strategic investments this quarter, which we believe will bolster our front end origination capabilities longer term. Continuing to invest and growing these front end origination platform is a key tenet of our growth strategy, so you should expect us to announce additional investments to further broaden the platform. Our recently announced partnership with Victory Park will give us access to proprietary origination in the ecommerce financing markets. Additionally, Athene acquisition of Foundation home loans will complement our expanding asset sourcing in the residential mortgage space in the UK, we expect that businesses will be multiple -- both of these will be multiple billion asset originators for Athene's balance sheet, and our institutional investors over the coming several years. As part of our broader innovation agenda, we announced two key investments this quarter, Motor partners and Figure. We are embracing technology as another way to expand our origination and distribution capabilities and to help put us at the forefront of advancement and disruption across financial services. Additionally, we believe that the broad adoption of blockchain to materially reduce back office operating expenses and presents additional revenue synergy upside.  In conclusion, we are making substantial investments across our credit and opportunistic businesses, as well as our enterprise solutions platform to take advantage of the opportunity set in various growth markets. We have shown meaningful progress on expanding our capabilities and footprint in the first half of the year. And you should expect to see us continue to make additional announcements in the coming months. With that, I'll turn over to my partner Martin. No, I would echo that I think, well, what we've -- a great example, Alex, is the high grade alpha where those transactions were very -- were critical, and Athene or Athora or other insurance balance sheets with the lead buyer, but a combination of other third parties augmented that demand side, so they go hand in hand, the growth goes hand in hand, the creation and the development of these origination goes hand in hand. And certainly we look at them as multi year growth. The critical aspect is the origination angle. But the balance sheets of the insurance companies as well as third party institutions grow and certainly as you grow wealth management, that retail democratization will be at the trough as well. So what Marc just described is what we have with the names he mentioned, including Foundation where we'll take all those assets, put them onto our insurance or other balance sheets, and then the ongoing flow will exclusively come to us because we in essence, control and own that platform. Victory Park different; Victory Park, they have really spent a number of years really fine tuning their financing and funding to the growing expansion of online financial retail distribution. And in that case, we are a partner with that firm where we provide a senior facility, and they are the junior debt and equity underneath us. There is some alignment between warrants or otherwise. But again, we are aligning to their flow because as the ecosystem of finance and funding has evolved in the last 10 years, there are certain firms that are really connected with the consumer in other ways than traditional bank lending. And so we want to be the financing partner to those firms. And in those situations where we don't control all the aspects that Marc said, the ultimate control we have is to open or tighten the flow of product over a quarterly basis. So what we've actually found is the flexibility to go from 100% control to align partner around the US and around the globe. That's really allows us to create that incremental spread on that on that fixed income alternative is that Marc talked about. Sure, Bill, it's Jim. So this just a level set. If you look over the last number of years approximately 95% of our fundraising had been through our traditional institutional channels. And we had raised with some -- with a higher net worth that the private banks and a large warehouses, some of our flagship products, whether it was EPF or fund, our PE funds, Those had been a traditional distribution channel for us. Starting actually, in the middle of last year, we embarked on a strategy to dramatically increase our global wealth distribution channel. And we really aligned our senior leadership to allow the next generation to come up and run our institutional business, and proven leadership under St\u00e9phane to really focus on the global wealth channel. So we set it up about a year ago, part of the numbers that Marc and Martin went through about the hiring this year, we've hired a tremendous amount of folks. And so we believe that through the course of this year, we will have a team that can really feel the breadth of distribution across geographies, and products.  So to your next question, a lot of the products we have are just really opening the spigot to what we have today. But it's also creating new products that fit the accredited marketplace. Obviously, we have non traded BDC that we expect to be out in the market in the latter quarters of this year, and to really ramp up in '22 and beyond. But there are a variety of other products in the lab, that we will focus really on the yield and the hybrid products for the mass retail agendas not only in the US, but in Europe and Asia. So that's the three part plan. We all have seen how large the marketplace is, we believe it's a whether the numbers are $40 trillion or $55 trillion; it's a massive total addressable market. We believe our brand, our track record, our product innovation, will be able to conquer our fair share, and go on from there. But it's an exciting growth tool for the firm. And we expect to have our participation. Sure. So we think about our platform, as the landscape has evolved over the last decade and as our trends -- as our platforms evolve. As Marc and I and Martin have all said, origination is the key to our business. And so the ability for us to source product that we directly originate whether it's in the commercial real estate, residential, real estate, corporate world, it's critical to our long term growth on that spread business. The reality is the scale of our business today, the ecosystem of combining origination, structuring, and then in the need of syndication. It's like a flywheel, the larger transactions you get, there's a thinner universe of folks that can provide those capital solutions for the companies I mentioned Hertz being the one this year. And again, once that flywheel gets going, your ability to be important to borrowers, as well as not only our balance sheets, but third party, institutional clients and other LPs.  It's a critical flywheel. So yes, as we ramp up our bespoke origination in the US, but globally, and our dialogue with all different types of industries expands, you will expect to see larger transaction fees. And as I said, interestingly enough, last year with our success of the transactions, the ADNOC and the AB InBev, our ecosystem with large, US insurers dramatically increased. And not only did they come in for vehicles and SMEs on those types of products, but it expanded back into our business and some of our opportunistic impact infrastructure. And I suspect you'll see a lot more activity on those investors in Fund IX. So the flywheel and the ecosystem are connected. The whole capital solutions, capital markets transactions have worked between all three are inherently connected. And it's a big growth area. And we brought in some great leadership. We think that our capital markets and integrated platform, the fact that we don't have any information barriers between all of our businesses, what's going on in the syndication, syndicated loan market with direct lending, which we've been a big player in with our JV with Mubadala, these are all connected, and you'll see us talk continuously about those in the quarters and Investor Day to come. Yes, so I'll let Martin get in this detail as well. But whether it was Accord or some of the other products that have continued to do well, Accord is the reminder is the product that has a limited drawdown window 12 to 18 months, and then it's monetized. We're on Accord IV for now. And there's been some great success of that platform over the last three or four years. Hence, the development of the new products, Accord plus which expands it, but that really was probably the key reason on a quarter-to-quarter basis."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. Good morning to all. Pleasure to be here. Q2 '21 was a particularly strong quarter for Apollo. Business as you saw from our results is performing well across all metrics. Record quarterly FRE of $0.68 a share, the highest DE since 2013 of $1.14 per share strong and performance across the PE portfolio, up 9.5%, credit up 2.6%. The numbers speak for themselves. And Jim and Martin, I don't want to steal their thunder, they will review specifics of the quarter with you. In terms of other corporate housekeeping, our merger timing with Athene is on track. We expect that to close in January of '22. During the quarter, we continue to make progress across the governance and cultural enhancements. We welcome David Simon to our board. As we are on track to simplify our voting structure in connection with the merger that would again will happen in January of '22. For those who didn't see it, we recently published our 12th edition of our annual ESG report detailing how we take a holistic approach across all of the communities we operate in, and how important this is to our franchise. We also announced during the quarter our commitment to all finance and important initiative designed to diversify the alternative industry and expand opportunity to historically black colleges and universities. Additionally, during the quarter, the key person clauses in our private equity business have been satisfactorily approved and addressed. Having gotten through the housekeeping, let me do as I often do on these calls, take a step back and look at the big picture. The demand for our end product, access return remains incredibly strong. Drivers of this are persistently low rates, a growing retirement market, both for retail and institutional. Importantly, the disappearance of spread in almost any form in public markets. And the democratization of access to alternative credit and equity across other channels than historically have been available. We have positioned the firm. And the way we go to market is our ability to generate excess return alpha at all points across the risk reward spectrum. We view this as our competitive advantage. We view this as our rationale. We are in the alpha generation business rather than the collection of AUM for the purpose of collecting AUM. Across our opportunistic franchise and our hybrid franchise, we approach this in a contrarian, value oriented mentality with a proven track record over a variety of market cycles over 31 years. And the results as you've seen previously are spectacular. In Yield, the largest of our segments, this is a fixed income replacement business. This is not an opportunistic credit business. Our goal in our yield segment is to produce 150 to 200 basis points of excess return over the equivalent CUSIP across the capital structure. We want to get paid in our yield business for illiquidity and complexity and origination, not for taking additional credit risk, or assuming other risks that we do not intend. Again, stepping back, as we've said previously, in the broadest terms, over the next five years, I expect our yield business to double. And I expect our opportunistic and our hybrid business to be 50% larger. I believe this will take place without any significant acquisitions in our asset management segment. Although, as you will see, and Martin will address, we have ample capital to accelerate our growth if we find interesting opportunities. Last year, we added 300 people to our 1,300 person base. This year, we will add between 300 and 400 people. And I am confident that we will end the year position to support and accelerate growth into 2022. I don't want to take too much away from strategy, but I will step back and now talk a little bit about strategy as we are fortunate to be in a growth business. Almost every day the business gets better. The trends in the business are overwhelmingly favorable. And we look forward to providing you an in-depth perspective on our business and our go forward strategy at an Investor Day, which we will announce which we expect to take place in the month of October. In advance of Investor Day, I want to touch on a couple of building blocks which I've mentioned previously. In order for us to double the yield business and increase the opportunistic and hybrid business by 50%, we need to do a couple of things. First and foremost, is to expand our capacity to generate investments, origination. Second is to strengthen our distribution capabilities, particularly in our hybrid and opportunistic segments. And third and a relatively new area for us to touch on, but one that consumes a lot of our time and mindshare is to prepare the company for the innovation and change that is taking place across the financial services landscape. Make no mistake the innovations we are seeing in FinTech which have taken place across trading markets, and other types of markets are coming to alternative finance. We view this as a significant opportunity rather than a threat, as I believe we are well prepared for it. And I believe our industry, given that it moves relatively quickly, will be well positioned to take advantage of this. Let me start by a review of origination. A lot of what I read, particularly in the analysts commentary, and even ourselves, we talk about the permanent nature of our capital, so called perpetual capital. I think of origination as perpetual asset origination. We want each year not to have to start from zero. We want to be able to count on recurring asset origination opportunities across our yield business, because the demand for yield product is going up, and 100% of what we originate has a home. This quarter, we made significant progress in the origination. We announced a significant relationship with Victory Park which will give us access on a senior basis to the growth and technology lending space. And we announced the acquisition of Foundation Mortgage, a UK based mortgage lender, you should expect to see us make additional announcements with respect to our origination franchises over the remainder of the quarter. We are and the industry is short origination. The capacity to originate, the expansion of our capacity to originate is key to our growth, particularly across our yield business. As it relates to these alternative distribution channels, again, significant progress was made during the quarter, we expect to have a fully ramped up retail distribution business in place for the launch of Fund IX as well as certain credit products toward the end of this year. And we expect retail to be a significant part of our go forward strategy, which I know Jim will spend some time on in his remarks. Let me hit on this other topic of innovation and change coming to our landscape. Apollo, one of our key strengths is in financial services, not just in the growth of our retirement services businesses, but in banking, in lending, in origination. Our business as I said is evolving. And we like our peers are ourselves a large financial institution. Changes are coming to the way products are distributed. Changes are way coming to the way we securitize and the way markets function. And changes are coming to the way we originate assets. All of these things as I said, we welcome. I believe these plays toward our strength, rather than something that we should be concerned about. During the quarter, we announced two significant ventures, one with Motive, which is a strategic investment to help position us at the forefront of FinTech and technological innovation. And the second with Figure, which is a strategic collaboration to implement blockchain, across the investment lifecycle, particularly focused on securitization. These are not pie in the sky. These are real, tangible things that will have immediate cost benefits, data collection benefits and other benefits to our business. Away from the three things I mentioned, a lot of interesting opportunities during the quarter, you will hear and I will steal a little bit of Athene thunder. There is a robust stream of growth in retirement services across the platform. This year, we expect to originate at Athene north of $30 billion on an organic basis. And if trends continue, could be as much as $35 billion. Further, we made a significant minority investment joining Athene in taking a stake in Challenger. Challenger looks an awful lot like Apollo and Athene But in a fast growing and really interesting Australian market. They are both an originator of assets, as well as the largest provider of annuity product in the Australian market. Before I turn it to Jim and Martin, I just want to make it clear, there is just incredible momentum across the platform. This is internal and this is external. We are laying the groundwork for first and exciting Investor Day, but also looking very much forward to completing the merger with Athene beginning of '22 and a very strong '22. We are seeing the tangible benefits of the cultural initiatives we put in place. Our workforce is engaged, excited, and wants to be back in the office. With that my pleasure to turn the call over to my partner James Zelter. Maybe, it's Marc, maybe I'll provide a framework for it, and then turn it to Martin and to Jim to fill in. So broadly, what we've said, and again, we will be more specific in Investor Day, we expect our yield business to double. And we expect our opportunistic and hybrid business to be 50%, larger over the next five years. That is a doubling of the business, doubling of FRE, doubling of AUM and that is without significant acquisitions, or any real acquisitions, from the capital that we have accumulated in the capital that we will accumulate at the combined entity. So I think that provides at least some backdrop and framework for how we're going to grow. I'll dig into a little bit on without Athene question. And this will carry over to remarks I expect from other questions. 100% of any asset that we originate in the yield business has a home. In fact, 150% of any asset that we originate in the yield business has a home, we as an asset manager, have a choice. And that choice is do we derive a pure asset management fee from that? Or do we derive a pure asset management fee plus spread related earnings? What we have done and what the merger with Athene reiterate is that we believe given that asset scarcity is the limited on our growth in the yield business rather than liability accumulation, we should earn as much money as possible from assets that we originate. That does not mean at the expense of third party business, because we can't take concentrated positions on to a retirement services balance sheet. But and so what we have done is we have built an expanding ecosystem of similarly situated companies, all of whom face the same challenge that Athene and others face, which is the absence of spread in public markets. So long as we increase the origination capacity, 100% of those assets have a home, they can go onto Athene and Athora's balance sheet, they can go to third parties, they can go as we've already suggested into a mix, as opposed to looking at it as one or the other. So Jim, Martin? Maybe I'll just -- I'll close out because I think we're -- one point that I do want to emphasize the go-to-market strategy asset origination is key. But it also is followed by alignment. There is nothing more reassuring to a third party client, then the affiliated balance sheet owns the same security and size same time same price. That is in fact a unique selling proposition and why in particular in things like high grade alpha and we expect other areas. We will see significant growth in third party business side by side with Athene. Okay. So first, Glenn, thank you. These are not your droids either. Just to show you that we actually, we could publish. But let's come back to what origination is. Origination gives us control of documentation. It gives us control of diligence. It gives us control of structure. And it gives us improved economics. But one thing it does not give us is liquidity. We think that is the right trade off for a fixed income replacement business, which are the general characteristics of our yield business. There is no one size fits all with respect to the platform. But the reason to do this is to control the credit process and the diligence process and not expose yourself to undue risks. In some of the platforms and I won't just stop there because there are Donlin, PK Aviation, mid cap, net lease, and a number of others. In some of the platforms we derive as Apollo or as the broader Apollo, Athene and third party management ecosystem 100% of the production.  In others, we also securitize and participate in capital markets, at least for a portion. This is all about optimization of the specific risk reward in platforms we own, and platforms we partner with, which is another way for us to acquire a platform. Now let Jim address what we do with Victory Park. And more broadly, Glenn, just to come back to this again, we as an industry, and often particularly we spent a lot of time talking about perpetual capital, we really are interested in perpetual asset origination. We need to start each year understanding that we have the capacity to generate significant amounts of yield the assets appropriate for the client base, internal and third party that we have elected to serve. Sure, let me work backwards. The key person again, I think as Scott suggested in his remarks last quarter, the PE franchise is a franchise that has been well institutionalized. The team that oversees our private equity business have Matt Nord and David Sambur have really been the primary contributors for the past three funds, the results in the business are nothing short of spectacular as you heard this morning, then the notion just to step back that a $25 billion fund is up high 40s, gross and high 20s net. And such a strong MOIC is itself astounding, almost sounds like venture numbers. So I do not believe that we really ever thought that this was an issue, and it simply reflects the evolution and maturation of the franchise where those people who are most important to the franchise are now I'll say key men, but I really mean key person, because that's increasingly where we're going. And those who are less important to the franchise, or are moving on as in Josh's case, are no longer key people. So not an issue. Culture is a big area of focus. So when I divided the tasks with my two partners, Scott and Jim, I said what you would expect, as CEO I get to choose first. So I'd like to do strategy, culture, communication, and dealing with problems. And I left most everything else to the two of them, including the day to day running of the business. But culture is key. Internally, Apollo's culture has really always worked. I mean I give these statistics but it sometimes it's helpful just to reframe it.  We started 2020 as 1,300 person firm. We added 300 people remotely during 2020. And turnover went down, we will add between 300 and 400 people and turnover is trending down. What we have built internally is the most collegial, the most integrated, the most entrepreneurial model. And I believe all of those things we need to do and we need to double down on. Having said that, we also need to recognize that the world is changing and markets are changing. Increasingly, our business by population is comprised of FRE generation businesses around yield. That requires a different set of compensation tools, a different culture and a different approach. And we are evolving rather than radically changing. The momentum in this place is palpable, and it feels great.  I'll just add I want to not leave it unsaid. Governance is also a transition. As I previously noted on calls, our entire industry is going through an evolution, the evolution started, we all pretty much started as private equity only Private limited partnerships. Those firms that were successful in those activities and institutionalize their business God trusted with more capital, those that also did well, with more capital got to broaden the strategies. And once you got to that a number of the firms sufficiently as institutionalized were successful and going public. That generation of founders will turn over. I know some don't think that will happen, but inevitably will happen. We are the first of the large firms really to go through that wholesale transition, not just at a management level, but at the governance level and a shareholding level. As I said, somewhat jokingly, I believe others will do it less noisily than we have. But it does feel good to be on the other side of that. The business functions normally, we function with the board as any public company would function with the board. And there's just no impediment to what we're doing. We will lay out in Investor Day, alongside the topics that Martin discussed our approach to governance, and also approach to compensation and some of these cultural initiatives going forward. But it does feel really good. So it's Marc, I think it will depend; we'll see how it develops. But just to recap, we over a roughly 12 year period, we're a minority shareholder of Athene, and only earlier this year did we decide to bring in 100%. We also have a significant but minority shareholding in Athora and so we look around the world. And there are a bunch of really interesting markets. And this is probably more than you want. But regulatory change and the absence of spread in public markets is creating opportunities in Japan and Taiwan, in Hong Kong and a number of other markets. Some of those markets are best access through reinsurance or through other types of entry strategies. But a market like Australia is best accessed, in our opinion, through a stake holding in an established company with its own strategy, its own regulatory and asset origination capability, and quite frankly, a mentality that is very similar to ours. So I think it's early days. But I'll come back to the growth in the retirement services business is not about liabilities. It is all about assets. Look, we'll do a little of this now, but I think there are some of the obvious. First comes to me in balance sheet. Most of the FinTech providers do not want to be the owners of the assets; they want to be the pipe or the originator. And we are an excellent partner for platforms that we trust, whose underwriting we trust with full visibility and full credit, and documentation due diligence. And what you will see us do is what we've been doing backing those who we think are winners, taking stakes, where we think it's important to take a stake, and otherwise facilitating an infrastructure and an ecosystem that generates the kind of fixed income replacement 150 to 200 basis points over comparable and investment grade that we are looking for. And we have a huge appetite for this. And we are a relatively easy partner to work with, and very commercial. The second place is we are a massive user of FinTech services; look at our securitization business, which is the first area that we are attacking with Figure.  This is an opportunity for cost reduction, documentation improvement, debt data gathering speed to market. And I doubt this will be the last of the partnerships that we have in terms of validation of blockchain or other types of services that offer these opportunities. And that's before we start thinking about our own business. Jim alluded to it. But if you think back to Jim's comments on the security, excuse me, the syndication business; the syndication business has existed in its existing form for forever. We generate in a centralized way, a clearinghouse of product, and it's sold salesperson to salesperson. My guess is you will see, over time, some amount of technology applied to that. And the pace of innovation is actually increasing. And what we're seeing is a lot of the most interesting innovation is taking place in the high net worth and ultra high net worth channels first. And I expect that to continue over the near term. And ultimately, to move into the institutional channel. Final thing I would point to is the entire documentation process, the subscription. And signing on for institutional partnerships is surprisingly antiquated. Probably the best word I could find. I think the streamlining of our business, through the use of technology, including through interactions with our investors, is just going to gather steam. But those would, I would say, the mundane, more to come. Yes, Bill, this is alternatives that we would do what we can to avoid a significant and persistent selling of stock, obviously subject to agreement, but there are the obvious structural transactions that we can look at to do that. My sense is he is comfortable with what he's done. And as he steps back from the business, he wanted to lighten up a bit. So it's not surprising. But he'll make his own decisions. And if we can facilitate that, then we will. Yes, it was a couple of different funds. But Patrick 90%, plus 90% of the total carry came from PE and that was across portfolio of funds. It's actually interesting that we're seeing the tail end of Fund VII, the Fund VIII to Fund IX and the bulk of the carry coming from Fund VIII and hybrids is contributing as well. So there's each of those funds has a diverse portfolio of investments which are starting to monetize principally in Fund VIII but Fund IX is helping around the hedges and so as we look forward, the main story will be Fund VIII realizations for the next handful of years and then Fund IX should pick up on the back of that in real size. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to Apollo Global Management's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During today's discussion, all callers will be placed in a listen-only mode and following management's prepared remarks, the conference call will be open for your questions. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in any Apollo Fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Mintzberg, Head of Investor Relations.\nPeter Mintzberg: Thanks operator and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Marc Rowan, CEO and Co-Founder; Scott Kleiman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO and Co-COO. I would like to turn it over to Marc to kick off our comments for today.\nMarc Rowan: Good morning. Thank you Peter and welcome all. Q1 2021 was a strong quarter for Apollo. Record FRE of 287 million or $0.65 a share up 26% year-over-year, up 4% sequentially. Total inflows of 13 billion, excuse me, fund driven by 5 billion of fund raising and 4 billion of Athene organic growth. AUM of 461 billion up 145 billion year-over-year, 46% year-over-year and 6 billion quarter-over-quarter reflecting 13 billion of inflows, 9 billion of positive marks on the PE portfolio, partially offset by reductions in the yield portfolios at Athene and Athora due to rising rates and changing position of the Euro. Our opportunistic businesses had a particularly strong quarter as they are positioned for a strong U.S. and European recovery. The PE portfolio in particular was up 22% versus an S&P of 5.8%.  Scott, I know will take you through more details including deployment and realizations, and Martin will take you through the financials. As I discussed on our last earnings call, I had some simple observations on our business and by extension our strategy. We are in our growth business. This quarter and the year-over-year results make this abundantly clear. We provide a product that is in high demand. We provide excess returns to investors on a risk adjusted basis. We serve a growing market driven primarily by the need for retirement income. We serve this market directly through our Athena and Athora affiliates and indirectly through our institutional clients, our pension funds, retirement system, sovereign wealth funds, and others. The demographics and market trends of our market, aging indexation, low rates, need for retirement income mean that in general the business gets better every day.  We recognize how fortunate we are to be in a growth business. If you dig down to the next level, if you look at our largest business, our yield business, which is more than 330 billion of our AUM, that business is not limited in its growth by capital or liabilities. It is limited in its growth by assets, and that limitation is only temporary. It is our job and therefore our strategy to expand our capacity to generate assets that provide interesting risk reward for this segment of the market. In our hybrid and opportunistic businesses it is a little bit more balanced. Some of our strategies still have substantial room to expand by expanding their access to capital because the front end of those businesses is just so strong.  Apollo's unique value proposition is that we are exceptionally good at generating excess returns across a very broad swath of the risk return spectrum from investment grade to private equity. Examples of excess return across this very broad spectrum, not over one year but over a very long period of time, I think are instructive. In private equity, our 31-year return is 39% gross, 24% net with every core private equity fund having generated carry an incredible track record, which puts us substantially ahead of the top quartile PE performance. It's not any one fund, it's not the size of fund, it's not any one investment cycle, it is the discipline of the franchise and what we do and I know Scott will spend time walking you through the returns of the most recent fund and how we approach our opportunistic businesses. In our yield business I believe the best example of our capacity to generate excess return is manifested by examining our largest client, Athene. If you look Athene since inception over more than the past decade, their ROE and their insurance businesses is 22% and on a consolidated basis 15% on average over this period of time. This is substantially in excess of any comparable company or comparable index.  In the context of this background, this quarter was all about reinforcing strategy, building our front end or capacity to generate additional assets, and positioning us to grow faster. The biggest step in the quarter was obviously our decision to enter into an agreement to merge with Athene. This transaction massively reinforces our position serving retirement income and retirees, adding almost a million clients including our pension retirement transfer business, and average age in the high 60s. This transaction adds to our capacity and coordination to develop additional yield platforms through aligning Apollo and Athene. Thinking back to what we have been able to achieve with us not fully aligned, whether it is our mid-cap corporate credit business, our triple net lease business, our aircraft finance business, our Redding Ridge structured products business, the list goes on and on. I'm excited as to what we can achieve with full alignment.  In our hybrid and opportunistic businesses, this transaction increases our ability to see products and to see teams and to launch new funds and simply to get to market faster. Some examples of what we've done historically include our hybrid value fund, our infrastructure fund, and numerous others. The transaction also represents a significant strengthening of our connection to additional forms of distribution, including retail banks, independent broker dealers, and other wealth channels. These wealth distribution channels represent a significant source of growth for us and we expect 2021 even prior to the closing of the transaction with Athene to be a record year for Apollo in these channels and a source of significant future growth.  The merger was not the only step we took in the quarter to reinforce our strategy. Significant progress was made in our high grade alpha business. Apollo has developed a unique platform to provide capital and funding to large corporations globally in the investment grade market. Our unconstrained appetite for long-dated creative and semi-liquid solutions have allowed us to execute multi-billion dollar transactions in a short timeframe as a sole counterparty to these corporations. Working with our partners, with our 400 plus investment professionals, we expect to generate 15 billion to 20 billion of these transactions in 2021. Also in the quarter, we announced the launch of our Credit Secondaries business, a new platform levering our insurance affiliates appetite for this asset class into a very fast growing private Credit Secondaries market. This is one of the first funds in this rapidly growing split space and we plan to raise substantial additional money in the future for this strategy as we continue to build out our general partnership solutions capabilities.  In summary, this is an investment year. We're focused on setting the business up so that it grows faster over the next five years and Scott will take you through some of the investments we're making during 2021 in his prepared remarks. Away from the financials of the business and the strategy of the business, we delivered the changes in governance that we had set out in our first -- in the first conference call I had done with you. We began to implement changes to our governance to establish a simpler, more transparent corporate structure we believe ultimately positions us to be eligible for S&P index inclusion.  In closing the business is firing on all cylinders. We're making tremendous progress, and I'm very optimistic about growth. I want to take this moment to thank over 1700 Apollo employees around the world, including 59 new hires in Q1 who worked tirelessly to achieve the results we have announced today. Culturally the senior management team is focused on positioning the firm to speak authentically about what we can achieve and what we can particularly have an impact on. We are very focused on expanding opportunity, particularly for broader segments of society that here to for may not have that access to the same opportunities. We can do this at Apollo, we can also do this through our portfolio companies. More to come on this in the near future.  Our efforts around citizenship, diversity, equity, inclusion, and ESG are core to our value proposition for our people and we continue to raise awareness and deepen education on the key issues. In January, we received a score of a 100% from the human rights campaign foundation, with regard to being the best place to work for LGBTQ equality. Yesterday, we announced a significant donation to United Way India's Partner Act to immediately deploy thousands of oxygen concentrations and other critical life saving medical equipment to those in most need. Our hearts go out to the Apollo community in India and their loved ones who are experiencing the impact of this crisis. With that I will now turn it over to Scott. \nScott Kleinman: Thanks Mark and thank you all for joining us this morning. As Mark mentioned, Apollo differentiates itself by the ability to generate excess returns across the entire risk reward spectrum. In this quarter, we again demonstrated the strength of this proposition across our platform. When I think about the overall performance of the business, I break it down into five key factors; finding good investments to deploy capital, having the portfolio accrete and value, monetizing our investments, raising more capital, and investing in and growing both our existing platforms as well as our new ones. So far in 2021, Apollo has made very good progress across all of these areas. So let me get through them one by one.  Regarding deployment, our ability to find attractive returns at all points along the risk spectrum shines in an environment like the one we're in now where valuations are seemingly high for private equity and yields are painfully thin for most credit products. Total deployment for Q1 was 24.9 billion. Our private equity funds deployed 2.4 billion in capital in the quarter. Additionally, we committed to deploy a further 3.3 billion in the quarter driven by two large Fund IX investments Michaels and the Venetian. And since quarter end, we've continued to commit to significant additional transactions. We continue to see a strong recovery in the economy, particularly in those sectors hardest hit by COVID such as leisure, travel, gaming, and specialty retail and we continue to invest in those spaces. Our hybrid value business continues to be active with over $0.5 billion deployed in the quarter.  Strong deployment of 19.1 billion in our credit business in the first quarter was in line with fourth quarter levels and includes strong insurance balance sheet growth on insurance inflows and pension risk transfer transactions. With spreads tight, others are going down in quality to earn returns but we've been moving up in credit quality and finding our returns through superior asset selection and origination. This will set us up well in the future. We're preparing for, but not predicting higher rates to come. Our initiative to seek increased high-grade alpha origination transactions continues to grow and has a robust pipeline. We continue to see substantial opportunities to provide capital and funding solutions to corporations and financial institutions globally with the ability and expertise to find innovative solutions and structures. Also, we are now fully in the European direct loan market committing to $1 billion in the first quarter. This is a space we weren't present a year ago.  And lastly JCPenney has agreed to transfer 2.8 billion in pension obligations for roughly 30,000 participants in JCPenney's pension plan to Athene as part of a pension transfer transaction. Athene utilized its strategic capital vehicle ACRA to support the completion of this transaction. In terms of value creation this has been an exceptional quarter for Apollo. Marc just mentioned our very strong track record in private equity for over 31 years. We continue to show that we have an ability to find attractive returns in any market environment. We continue to believe that purchase price matters and we will utilize our expertise to creatively source structure and optimize assets, adding value in partnership with our growing in-house operations team of experts. This can clearly be seen in our most recent and largest funds Fund IX. We're seeing very strong performance in this fund with the current marks up 33% leading to an IRR of 49% gross, 26% net, and a MOIC of 1.7 times. While we expect these numbers to converge over time towards historic levels, we see the results as a validation of our investment expertise and of the fact that this continues to be a very high return business, if done the right way. In a market characterized by indexation, correlation, and volatility, Apollo's investment discipline really stands out.  During the quarter our overall private equity segment appreciated by 22% as compared to the S&P at 5.8% driven by exceptionally strong performance across our funds public and private holdings. Fund VIII and Fund IX appreciated by 19% and 33% respectively, driving an increase in the net carry asset to $3.04 per share up from a $1.82 per share in the fourth quarter. Importantly, Fund VIII returned to paying cash carry and the netting whole of the funds has been eliminated. Fund VIII is now market a multiple of invested capital of 1.8 times and we expect it to continue to grow and create value as the portfolio matures. As a reminder, Fund IX crossed into carry in the fourth quarter of last year and as of the first quarter, it is in full carry. Our hybrid value fund is delivering strong performance with gross IRR of 31%, 25% net, and MOIC of 1.3 times. We also experienced strong performance with our infrastructure equity fund in the quarter up 15%. In credit our funds aggregate portfolio returned 4% during the quarter, 1.9% above the benchmark. Notably, our global corporate credit business generated a 3% total return in the quarter, reflecting over 80 basis points of outperformance to its benchmark. In addition the performance of structured credit exceeded the index by approximately 400 basis points for the quarter and our credit strategy fund generated 5% in the quarter, 150 basis points above its index. Our strong credit performance has been driven in part by the excess spread we've been able to generate for our insurance and other clients, which stems from our differentiated and expanding origination capabilities.  Regarding realizations, we saw a strong monetization of our investments with $3.7 billion of capital returned to LPs in the first quarter. The total capital return to LPs over the last 12 months adds to $10.4 billion. We announced several large transactions this quarter, including the highly successful IPO of Sun Country, a Fund VIII portfolio company, the merger of Tech Data, a Fund IX portfolio company with Synnex, the sale of AmeriHome owned by Athene and several Apollo Funds to Western Alliance, and NGO Energy Partners through our yield business. We have a strong pipeline and expect to continue generating strong monetization for our investors.  On fundraising, this quarter we raised a significant amount of capital from third party investors near the high end of the $15 billion to $20 billion annual range we have discussed in the past. All in all, we've made great progress with our investors over the quarter and for the most part they have been incredibly supportive of all the recent changes at Apollo. We have several fundraising capital in the market now and closed on $4.8 billion in the quarter. In addition, we saw inflows of 4.2 billion from our insurance affiliates with total inflows for the quarter of 13.4 billion. We also see a huge opportunity to expand our distribution in the wealth management channel and are building now the capability to do that. We are confident in our fundraising targets for the year and have already raised over 2 billion since quarter end.  Lastly, with respect to investing in our platform and growth, to echo Marc's comments, we see incredible opportunities to accelerate growth and are investing in the business. It is an exciting time to be in the asset management business. Capital flows are concentrating towards a select few players who can provide the breadth of products and services that investors are looking for and that trend is only accelerating and creating new winners and losers. We see an enormous opportunity ahead of us and we're planting the right seeds to take advantage of many of these growth opportunities. We're adding over 400 employees this year across all parts of our business. We're growing our core product teams and building capabilities to scale our platform and increase our ability to generate excess returns across several areas, including infrastructure, impact investing, credit and GP Secondaries, direct origination, capital markets and syndication, and SPACs just to name a few.  As we build these growth engines we're also continuing to build the enterprise solutions seems to support this growth. We're confident, confident that this type of investment will produce at least mid-teens growth in FRE over the long term, with some fluctuations between low teens and high teens, depending on investment opportunities in any given year. We believe the path forward is bright for Apollo and we're excited to continue on this strong trajectory. I speak for the entire management team in expressing our gratitude for our deep bench of talent who've come together to drive the success that we've experienced so far this year. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks, Scott. For the first quarter, Apollo recorded exceptional results across all relevant financial and operating metrics. Our GAAP net income to common shareholders was $670 million or $2.81 per share in the first quarter, as compared with $0.44 per share for the full year 2020 and $3.71 per share for the full year 2019. We generated record FRE of $0.65 per share on a pretax basis, up 26% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth in management fees and an uptick in FRE performance fees related to our CLO manager. Management fees grew 3% over the prior quarter and 17% over the first quarter of 2020, driven by growth in fees for investing the assets of our insurance clients and deployment across our platform broadly.  Transaction and advisory fees were $56 million in the quarter, driven by capital solutions transactions and private equity activity. Though this represents a more normalized level than in recent quarters, it is nearly double the pre-2020 quarterly average, up 51% year-over-year and is more representative of the run rate we expect as our origination business further scales. Compensation expense was flat over the prior quarter. However, we expect this to grow over the next few quarters as we continue to invest in the growth initiatives that Scott outlined. Non-compensation costs fell 21% over the prior quarter as a result of both the seasonality and the absence of any one time items. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, non-comp was elevated due to costs related to the independent review. For the first quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.50 per share and after tax distributable earnings of $0.66 per share, supported by both our strong pre-tax FRE and net incentive earnings of $0.10 per share. After tax distributable earnings of $294 million were up 78% over the first quarter of 2020 and reflect the return of Fund VIII to paying cash carry.  Turning to AUM, we ended the first quarter at $461 billion up $6 billion quarter-over-quarter and $146 billion year-over-year. Inflows totaled $13 billion for the quarter reflecting robust fundraising of $5 billion for numerous strategies across the platform, organic growth at Athene, and growth in our CLO platform. The third party capital raised in the quarter is an indication that our relationships with LPs remain strong and we expect the majority of capital raised headwinds to now be behind us. For the first quarter fee generating AUM fell nominally due to interest rates driven markdowns on Athene and Athora\u2019s balance sheets. However, fee generating AUM grew 43% year-over-year supported by continued inflows and capital deployment. The impact on management fees of the markdowns of these balance sheets is largely reflected in the first quarter numbers and represents approximately 1% of management fees on an annualized run rate basis. While higher rates do reduce management fees on Athene\u2019s existing assets, we believe that higher rates are a net positive for Athene and Apollo given increased origination volumes and an ability to earn higher income on deployment into new assets.  Turning to incentive realizations, we recognized $107 million of gross performance fees for the first quarter, primarily related to monetization activity in Fund VIII and our hybrid value fund in our private equity business. As Scott mentioned, the impairment netting whole in Fund VIII has been eliminated as of the end of the first quarter, driven principally by secondary transactions of One Main, [indiscernible] and Sun Country. Fund VIII has a multiple un-invested capital of 1.8 and a current gross and net IRR of 18% and 13% respectively. The callback obligations of $0.17 per share that we report in our earnings release are related to older legacy funds, including Fund V and some older credit funds and specific to those funds and not cross collateralized across other funds. We do not expect these callback amounts if materialized to become cash obligations for at least several years from now.  Deployment in our drawdown funds was $2.7 billion in the first quarter and our pipeline across the platform remains robust as we have significant equity commitments on announced transactions in our private equity business. Our broader measure of deployment, which reflects the breadth of our origination business was again strong at $25 million in the first quarter. Deployment was driven by strong growth in insurance clients, including repositioning the assets acquired from Jackson, investments in our syndicated loans business, as well as middle market and commercial real estate lending activity. Now dry powder for investments across our fund complex was $50 billion at the end of the quarter of which $24 billion has the potential to drive management fees upon investment.  Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. Our net economic balance sheet value after debt and preferred stock was approximately $8 per share at March 31, up over $3 quarter-over-quarter primarily due to an increase in our total net performance fees, as well as an increase in value of our investment in Venerable, our variable annuity platform related to a transaction with Equitable. To echo Marc and Scott, we're very pleased with our first quarter earnings, driven by exceptional investment performance, growing fee earnings, and continued deployment and realization activity across the platform. We look forward to further accelerating growth in our platform, including via our announced merger with Athene and creating a corporate structure which will create flexibility to allocate capital to further growth at any of our businesses, which are returned to shareholders.  Lastly, we understand the desire for more specifics surrounding the announced merger with Athene, including performance segment financials and we look forward to providing that to you in conjunction with an Investor Day which we can't anticipate holding in the fall. With that I'll turn the call back to Peter. \nPeter Mintzberg: That concludes our remarks for today. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup. \nWilliam Katz: Okay, alright, thank you very much for taking the questions this morning. I was wondering if you could maybe start with maybe flushing out a little bit of the incremental spend into the retail channel, what that might look like, and then how quickly you think you could maybe leverage some of that investments?\nMartin Kelly: Sure. So as you probably understand, the retail channel is somewhat different than the traditional institutional channel, and requiring additional sales force, additional product development, and that's really the crux of it, investing in that space to support both existing products as well as new products to flow through those channels. So that's really the crux of the investment.\nWilliam Katz: Okay. Maybe Marc, just a follow up for you, I was wondering -- I was intrigued by the opportunity to investment grade. So wondering if you could maybe flesh that out a little bit, it sounds like a pretty big opportunity this year, but maybe help us understand maybe the broader opportunity set and then sort of how the economics compared to the back book?\nMarc Rowan: Well, a lot there Bill, I'll do my best. First, if you step back and think about what we're trying to do, the yield business that we have built, you should think of as a fixed income replacement business, rather than an opportunistic credit business. We liked that notion because what we're doing is we're trying to provide to our clients Athena, Athora, as well as our third party clients and credit funds 150 to 200 basis points of excess return around the high-end, particularly the investment grade end of that fixed income marketplace. The way we do that is not by taking incremental credit risk, not by taking equity risk. We derive that return from two factors; one is structure, and the other is the willingness to accept illiquidity. For a regular way plain vanilla transaction, issuers will go to the investment grade market, the corporate market in a very methodical, easy to access way and there is not excess return. But if you look at the end of last year, and you look at the Hertz transaction, you look at the ADNOC transaction and you look at the Anheuser-Busch bottling transaction what you see are three different issuers, all approaching different problems, all in the investment grade end of the spectrum that required a solution.  We are one of the few participants who have the size, scale, and capacity to take down sizeable investment grade transactions. And so that is what we are seeking to do. I mean, the most fundamental we want 150 to 200 basis points of excess return over the comparably traded public IG, and we're willing to provide flexibility and structure and willing to accept the liquidity. This is a role that Q4 might have been provided by some of the largest banks or investment banks and I think increasingly we will get our share of this marketplace and it represents a very attractive marketplace and fits very synergistically with all that we do in fixed income replacement given that we cover a very large swath of the investment grade market anyway. It's a very different business than the peer set as a result of our unique client base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had several follow-ups with -- on the merger with Athene. So my first one was, do you know how GAAP will treat the Athene management fees after the merger is closed?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. GAAP, like in everything else will eliminate all intercompany transactions.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it, got it. And then are you going to continue to report distributor earnings after the merger closes and will it include total earnings from Athene as life insurance, free cash flow, and GAAP earnings, don't always match up?\nMartin Kelly: We'll give you a detailed -- we've taken our best guess at providing our view as to how we're going to report through our lens deck that is on our website and that we've previously disclosed. We anticipate that from a management view financials, we will report the way everyone else in the industry and the broader financial services industry reports intercompany segments, which is the fair value of management fees will be reported on the asset management side and the yield less the cost of these management fees will be reported on the insurance side. We do anticipate at this point continuing to report DE and as you see through our lens deck, we're envisioning the addition of an additional operating line of retirement services. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning everyone. My question is on kind of how to think about capital return post-transaction. With Fund VIII kind of through the netting hole now it's clear, obviously the cash realization out like look for the kind of legacy Apollo businesses looking increasingly strong. So with Athene\u2019s cash flow theoretically enough to kind of fund their growth, do you have any thoughts around the use of the excess cash likely to be generated from this very strong realization outlook on the legacy Apollo business? \nMarc Rowan: So I'm going to give you a broader answer, its Marc and if it doesn't suffice, you'll have to follow-up. So Apollo itself, just the asset manager is a highly cash generative business. As you know, we have announced the reset of our dividend to initially $1.60 per share, which we've said will grow along with the growth in the business. Just on that basis the distributable earnings of Apollo more than covers the dividend and makes it very clear that the Apollo business is very cash generative. Your starting point on Athene I believe to be too conservative. If you look back in history, Athene has actually distributed an immense amount of capital. They've just not distributed it as dividends, they've done it in terms of buybacks. They've distributed I don't have my notes in front of me, but call it 1.250 million [ph] plus or minus over a period of time. So now you have to step back and think about how Athene produces cash on a go-forward basis. Athene as you've said yes, it finances its own growth, but it also starts in a different place. It does not start at zero. Athene starts with 5.2 billion of excess equity capital, which is approximately 3.8 billion of excess equity on Athene\u2019s balance sheet plus 1.7 in a just in time LP driven side-by-side funding vehicle called ADF [ph].  In addition, Athene has less than 15% debt to cap whereas it's AA peers would have about 25% debt to cap again, approximately another 2.5 billion. So Athene starts with about 7.5 billion to 8 billion of excess deployable capital and what you're also watching is a maturation of the structure. The business rolling off Athene is generally business that is rolling off that was financed 100% with Athene\u2019s capital. That's how Athene began life. The business going on the books is generally going on the books, particularly the inorganic and PRT business, but likely over time the totality of Athene\u2019s business will be approximately one third of Athene\u2019s capital, and two thirds ADF capital. What we have tried to do is balance, is to take what here to four may have been a capital intensive business, make it less capital intensive through the introduction of third-party capital, which as an aside, the ADF One investors should be very happy. I'll leave it there and you should anticipate that we'd be very focused on ADF too, to support this growth.  And so it is my expectation that we will get excess capital from the Athene leg of the business and excess capital from the Apollo leg of the business against an announced $1.60 dividend. I think for Investor Day, we will do our best to go through this in detail, but suffice it to say that capital allocation is one of the things that is fully within our control and is something we should be judged on and we are all very large shareholders. But what it does is it creates options and that option is to reinvest in the business, adding additional capacity, and/or buy back stock. And we will look at that and now have the flexibility to do that every quarter and every year.\nPatrick Davitt: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I would love to learn a little bit more about your thoughts on the Credit Secondaries market overall. I'm curious if you're seeing the same reasons for the development that you saw on the private equity side, another meaning LP seeking liquidity for the same reason, is it the same kind of bid ask spread, do you see similar trends of that addressable market, any color there would be great, like just trying to see how big this can get in your mind over the next 25 years? \nMarc Rowan: Yeah, sure. So I think you are basically exactly right. The growth in credit funds over the last five, six, seven years has really been meteoric as you all know. And the reality is CIO's funds, pension funds are ultimately needing liquidity as they balance their portfolios is just the way this occurred for the private equity business 10 to 15 years ago. The real secret sauce if you will in a Secondaries business is having the knowledge of the underlying investments to be able to move rapidly and thoughtfully around making investment decisions. And because Apollo is the largest alternative credit lender, we have views and visibility on essentially every credit product, every underlying security in the market. And so our ability, our library of knowledge to be able to smartly access this market is really unparalleled. There's really no one of scale in this space right now, but we can already start to see the demand from pension funds, others who hold these credit funds to be able to seek liquidity. So we think this is a massively scalable market where we have real first mover advantage and real expertise to allow us to be the category killer in this space.\nGlenn Schorr: Maybe just one follow up. Traditionally in some other verticals, you might have a Fund I raise money, put it to work, show some performance then wait, and then start to raise Fund II. Theoretically, given what you have just laid out, this money could get put to work relatively quickly and we could see another fund relatively quickly, does that scare you off or is that okay?\nMarc Rowan: No, I think directionally that's right. Remember, when we think about this, this type of business is very applicable for some of our existing insurance clients and otherwise. So it gives us the ability to scale rapidly and opportunistically. But you are right, the third party demand should be pretty enormous and would expect to see this business scale faster than like say a PE type fund. \nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Thank you, great. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping we could spend a minute on your guys's, sort of bigger picture growth and management fee outlook over the next couple of years. So it sounds like there's a number of new initiatives in the business, some of them are kind of being accelerated potentially by the Athene deal. You talked about wealth management in a couple of other platforms. Can you give us a sense of kind of excluding or not sort of relying on insurance related partnerships and just really thinking about third party investor base, what sort of the sustainable management fee growth you expect to see over the next call it three years as you go through this investment cycle?\nMarc Rowan: So Alex this is Marc, I'll give you the broader overview and then I'll turn it to Martin. So, I think we've said broadly first. We will update our targets at our next Investor Day, but the way, at least some of us think about the business, the yield business, we think we can double over the next five years, that's circa 350 billion today. I think that'll be a $700 billion plus business, and I'll come back to why and how. The opportunistic business and the hybrid business is about 110 billion and 115 billion. And at least at first blush, I personally think they will be 50% larger over the next five years. So now to dig down and then I will turn it over to Martin for a bit, if you look at the strategy we've chosen in yield, it's in many ways a different strategy than our comparable peer set. We've chosen as I alluded to on an earlier question, fixed income replacement. This was driven by the need to serve our insurance affiliates. It also, if you look at roughly the 350 billion of AUM, about 60% of that is driven by the insurance affiliates, and 40% is driven by a third party clients and credit funds. I have no reason to expect that to change all that much as the business doubles, but let me get into what I mean by doubling the business.  If you dig down in the 350 billion, my best guess is it's 125 billion to 150 billion of alpha with the remainder beta. For us to double that business, we need to double 125 billion of alpha. That is a large number but it does not appear daunting to me, because a lot of it is focused on platforms providing repeatable origination. So to give you a sense of scale, we originated 17 billion of credit in the first quarter. We're on pace to do circa 75 billion to 80 billion for the year and that's up from last year where we did 47 billion of credit origination for the year. So we kind of seem to have the building blocks in place.  On the opportunistic side, I laid out the larger return, Scott laid out some of the more specific returns, and we've made a lot of progress with announced private equity transactions, I would expect that next year we'll be in the market for Fund XI, excuse me, Scott's correcting me. And we are in the process of scaling a number of other strategies, where we see origination capacity in excess of funds that we currently have, Asian real estate on our Asia structure and product business, infrastructure, social impact. So all in all I see really interesting ways to grow the business. Some of this and you've asked for excluding insurance affiliates, I don't really think of the business in that context because increasingly, what our limited partners and third party investors like on the yield side of our business, is the ability to co invest side by side with Athene and Athora same time, same price, same risk. We present ourselves to the market as an asset manager, who is not only interested in fee but is interested in the underlying asset and therefore full alignment.  On the opportunistic and the hybrid side of the business we are also in the same position although not to the same degree, whereas we might be 60% of the yield from affiliates. On the yield side of our business we're probably -- I will use the back of the envelope 15% to 30% of the business on the hybrid and opportunistic side of the business. Again, these are accelerants to growing because limited partners and other third party investors like that we have skin in the game and we eat our own cooking whatever your best analogy is. When we have previously come to talk to you, we speak to this business as a business that is roughly a 15% annual growth business. In years like this, my gut tells me FRE will be double-digits but below 15 as in this is investment year and in years, once we've made the investment it will be beyond 15%. But that's kind of the metric we hold ourselves to subject to update at Investor Day. The things we are doing are generally designed to help us get beyond that. Martin anything you want to add.\nMartin Kelly: No Marc, -- so translating that into the components of FRE management fee growth should be changed in line with what we've produced, we see no reason that that won't continue in the future. We are very focused on growing our origination businesses and growing our transaction fees as you have seen and we expect that to continue. And then we make decisions about investing in the platform. And so that translates into low double-digits or high-teens for growth year-to-year and Marc has sort of indicated what we expect this year but looking forward where we're confident that we'll be able to produce every FRE dollar growth consistent with what we've produced in the past, regardless of the channel that it comes from.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great, good morning everyone. Want to come back to the conversation on the retail channel and the opportunity as you guys lean in there more it sounds like and maybe just to talk a little bit about where you are on some of the product development that you referenced, what we should be expecting over the next few quarters and it seemed like this is a good landscape for innovation and to leverage maybe get some updated thoughts around how you're thinking about the addressable market for Apollo in this channel relative to the institutional channel longer-term?\nMartin Kelly: Sure, so I would say obviously when we look at Apollo's product platform, certainly yield products are going to be the place we lead into the global wealth channel. And that we're already making inroads there. I think it's still early days to see sort of substantial move the line item type results, but really we look at this over a two, three, four-year investment period, where by that timeframe you'll see meaningful progress there. But in the meantime, it's about taking products we have, getting it through the retail channel, and continuing to develop and tailor products that we learn are more specifically targeting those components.\nMarc Rowan: Maybe, it's Marc, I'll add and I'll step back. Look, there is a trend towards what we say is democratization of finance. That trend was more pronounced under Republican administration, it likely will be less pronounced under a democratic administration. But nonetheless, it is a trend and it's a trend we expect to continue. We see increased sophistication in the retail and the high net worth channels. And so if you step back, and you look at from our point of view, we have for a very long time been a distributor of opportunistic product to the high net worth channel, through private equity and a number of the other funds. What you will see us do in that channel is continue to do what we've been doing, to build it out to redouble our efforts we have made significant hires in these areas. And we intend to follow through and I would think on balance, you will see greater fundraising coming out of this channel this year, next year and in the future. And I do think that this is a trend, when we look back over the next five or 10 years, we will see retail high net worth as a larger percentage of total opportunistic fundraise than it has been over the past decade.  Then I go to completely to the other end of the spectrum and let's talk about Athene. So Athene is now the number one underwriter of retail annuities in the U.S. It is a substantial footprint. The footprint includes independent broker dealer, it includes bank, it includes other forms of distribution that I would say are more retail and less high net worth. They have made the investments in systems and infrastructure necessary to support a complex product set and insurance is a complex product set. Even if this product set is all income based. What Scott is focused on is in between the two. I believe and Scott believes and Jim believes and the whole team believes that we have the opportunity to continue to package our yield oriented products in ways that can go through the high net worth and the retail channels. And the investments there have also been made in people and teams and will continue to be made. You will see us launch at the second half of this year, at least two products through this channel that are yield based.  Again, when we look back over the next five or 10 years and compare it to the past decade, we will see continued democratization of finance. Our job I believe is to come at this channel with our unique value proposition which is not simply to sell as much as we can, it is to focus on what I believe the franchise does extraordinarily well, which is excess return at every point along the risk reward curve from private equity down to investment grade. The products that we ultimately expand in high net worth in retail is a product set we can have our own designs, but it is ultimately up to the channel and the end consumer as to which of those products are more applicable and it's our job to make them available and make our capabilities available and support them with the requisite infrastructure via technology infrastructure or people in wholesale infrastructure to do. This should not be unknown. Others in our industry have done it. Others have quite frankly been there first and are bigger. And there's plenty of roadmap for us to follow, for us to use this as an accelerant to what we otherwise are doing and it seems very logical and obvious to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. The total AUM in Athora stepped down from 4Q to 1Q in the non-sub advised area. And you mentioned in the prepared remarks that rates had a negative impact on Athene and Athora this quarter. This [indiscernible] Athora assets was more than 10%, is it possible to get a bit more color here on if it was just rates or if there were other factors as well? \nScott Kleinman: No Ken it was, that's a long duration portfolio. So it's more sensitive to a rate backup. And so it was a combination of rates and the Euro given that most of the portfolio's in Euro. But as I said, like the impact was pretty muted. It's all in the numbers for the quarter. And then when you get away from that net, net higher rates are better for the platform, both in terms of investing assets and originating through the insurance platforms.\nMartin Kelly: The other thing I'd say is, assets and liabilities are match. So, equity in both of those businesses continue to grow through the quarter. When you report assets, you're just looking at one half of the equation.\nKen Worthington: Yup, yup, understood. Okay, thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Harris: Great, thanks. Can you guys give us an update on your views on consolidation opportunities and insurance and I'm wondering how you think higher rates might impact that outlook?\nMarc Rowan: So I'll do my best, its Marc. So in general, as Martin said, higher rates are better for our business. First, we have an investment portfolio that has a decent amount of floaters in it on the Athene balance sheet. And second, higher rates can also help in pricing of new business including, excuse me, company to company new business. But I don't actually think that rates themselves have material impact on the ability or willingness of people to transact. What we are watching is, in my opinion, a realignment of the guaranteed or as we say in the U.S. annuity led insurance business. You're seeing companies particularly companies who may not have the ability to create asset alpha, which is ultimately what drives the business. Sell large blocks of business, they sell this through reinsurance, they sell this through company sales. And for the most part, it is being sold to people who have the capacity to generate alpha amongst assets that are appropriate for insurance company balance sheets, which tend to be investment grade or quasi investment grade assets. I see no lead up in that trend. And I think this rotation, out of guaranteed yield and into mortality, PNC and fee for service in both the U.S. and Western Europe is healthy. Our business in my opinion will not be limited in growth by our ability to source liabilities, only by prudence with respect to returns. And here I will give you a little more color.  Athene last year when they announced their fourth quarter, they gave some indication as to the profitability of the retail business they were generating. Typically, they have done between 15% and 20% cash on cash unlevered for new retail annuity business. Last year was at the higher end of that range. They will report on Friday and will give some notion of the profitability of business in the first quarter. If we are return maximizers or we are trying to build a long-term sustainable business, we should want to garner the lowest cost of funds, and therefore the highest level of repeat profitability for a decade for our retirement services business. Our ability to generate profitability at retail which is the lowest risk, most repeatable, most franchise nature, does put a floor on our willingness as to what we're prepared to pay for large blocks of annuities. It's not just about growth, it's about sustainable, profitable growth, and not simply just growing the business for the sake of growing the business. So the message I would convey, there are immense blocks of business that will trade hands. The blocks of business in the U.S. are well known. The blocks of business in Europe, in my opinion, are larger and less well known. And very few people have the platform that we have to be able to consolidate those blocks of business. In any one quarter you can see blocks trade or not trade but we will continue to be focused on underwriting profitable new business rather than new business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. \nMichael Carrier: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Apollo had a lot of change in the past six months and with that roles and responsibilities can shift around. Since Josh was on the call, and Leon no longer in the mix, just can you provide an update on leadership responsibilities like across segments and with LPs, and then any additional expected changes ahead?\nMarc Rowan: Its Marc, I'll lead off. Always uncomfortable to talk about myself, but we'll do our best. So, I am the CEO of the business. The lanes I have picked out for myself are strategy, culture which includes compensation, communication, urgent strategic initiatives, and dealing with problems. I am fortunate to be able to rely on an incredibly talented group led by Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman, who run the day to day of the Apollo business. They in turn have their own next generation that makes their job easier. At retirement services, at pro forma for consolidation, you have a business that is led by Jim Belardi, Bill Wheeler, Marty Klein, Grant Kvalheim, all of whom have been there a long period of time and I've worked with on a day to day basis.  If you step back and really think about the business, there's been a lot of external change. But I try not to lose sight that we actually grew the business by 145 billion in a year. Most of the change that's taken place has actually taken place within the business. And what is external, is mostly noise for us. This is now my 31st year at Apollo, my 36th year in business. I grew up in the opportunistic side of the business for 20 of those years and I've grown up on the retirement services on the yield side of the business for the last decade plus. This is not a new job. It's very clear what we need to do. We are very focused on what it is that we define the firm. We define the firm as providing excess return at every point along the risk rewards spectrum that we choose to participate in. We have really good tailwinds, whether it's demographics, market structure, or otherwise. We have a strategy that is focused on the three business segments I've outlined, opportunistic which I think this group and on the phone understands the best, hybrid which is the middle between opportunistic and yield, and then yield.  Yield is by far and away the largest segment of our business, and the fastest growing segment of our business. And we have chosen a strategy that plays to our strengths, fixed income replacement. This is a trend that is -- it makes our business in many ways totally different than our peer set. First, it is an easier business to scale just by the nature of its business. Second, 60% of that scaling today has been through our affiliates. Third, we present ourselves to the market in a unique way as aligned with our partners, because we take $0.50 to $0.60 of every trade, same time, same price. So for the most part we go about our business and we execute. Yes, we have had changes in roles. Josh is less involved in compensation, which seems like a natural given that I'm now the CEO. Josh is an active and productive and senior member of the Apollo team. He's on the Board, he's on the executive committee, he chose our transaction committee, which reviews our largest opportunistic deals. We get up for business every day and we execute the plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.\nRobert Lee: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess it may seem a bit odd question, you have to have so many new initiatives going on with standing origination platforms and Credit Secondaries business but can you talk a little bit more broadly maybe on a regional basis in a lot of your peers have been pretty vocal and aggressive about their expansion in Asia, Asia-Pac in particular, some through acquisition, mostly organic, that's not an area where you have a presence but you haven\u2019t talked about as much, can you maybe do something as in how you're thinking of down the road, kind of reach your global regional footprint and the opportunities there?\nMarc Rowan: Okay, I'll take a shot at it, its Marc and then I'll hand it to Scott. So when you step back and you look at our business, there's no denying that our business is primarily focused on the U.S. and Western Europe, with a little bit in Australia and a little bit in Japan. That is the outline of our business and within the context of our strategy and what I've outlined of doubling our yield business and a 50% increase in our opportunistic business, I believe we can accomplish that within our geographies. Having said that, we have been active in the broader Asian market for a long period of time but we have not elected to move large opportunistic funds into those marketplaces. The unique calling card that I believe that we have leverage is the strength of the firm to provide capital where there is excess return. For me, I believe that excess return to be primarily in yield and in structure products. And you should expect us to use the things that we do best to differentiate ourselves in markets that are not short of capital and function quite differently than the U.S. and Western European marketplaces.\nScott Kleinman: Look, I would agree with Marc. While historically, Asia has not been a huge target area for Apollo because we've been able to pursue all the growth we want and find the market opportunities we're looking for in North America and Western Europe, we're not blind to the opportunity set. We are starting to make small inroads, as Marc said, in places like Japan and Australia, but I would expect to see more overtime, but on a measured basis. It's not something that we feel like we have to jump in tomorrow. But it is obviously a big dynamic market and one which over time we will continue to incrementally grow into.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. I just a question on as insurance becomes more meaningful business for you guys, investors may want to better appreciate maybe potential balance sheet risks, can you talk about how you think about an assessed balance sheet risk on the insurance side as that comes over with Athene, what metrics will you be tracking, and if there is a problem or issue with one area of the portfolio how might we see that from the outside as I don't think it's mark-to-market or at least through the P&L at least? And what sort of sensitivities or scenario analysis do you look at that you might be able to share with us on the outside?\nMartin Kelly: Okay, so first, for the retirement services business, the issue and the risk has always been on the asset side. That is where I believe investors should focus, that is where we have focused. There's very little volatility around I'll call traditional measures of insurance type risk, like mortality and longevity or unexpected optionality on the part of policyholders. It is primarily an asset risk game. We have grown up and the entire firm has grown up with Athene by a relatively simple philosophy. Retirement services, insurance companies are a terrible place to take credit risk. They're a terrible place to take equity risk. But they are ideally situated to take some amount of liquidity risk since most of their liabilities are illiquid, and structure risk. And that is what you find on the Athene balance sheet. So we've now been through 12 years, there's 12 years of metrics. There's not whatever cycles have taken place in those 12 years we have written out. And you can look at our portfolio and I would encourage you to benchmark it not against other annuity companies, take the highest quality, best thought of peer group and I gave some of this through our lens deck, take proof, take met, take principle. And you will see whether it's a measure of losses, of capital buffer, of use of leverage, or anything else we have outperformed the double A benchmarks.  We have always been, Apollo has always been the residual equity holder of the risks that we take. Initially we were a 35% equity holder, some 2.5 billion of value. And now we are going to be 100% equity holder. The risk mentality mindset has not changed. So now I focus down into the specifics of your question, we do put out extensive credit decks. If you go back and you look at the period just after the lock downs in the U.S., you will see an extensive deck on our CLO portfolio, you will see an extensive deck on our CRE portfolio, you will see one on energy, you will see one on aircraft lending. And we will continue to do this. The granularity of information that we put out, there's nothing else like it in the insurance industry that I am aware of. This is how we run and monitor the business. We report on a quarterly basis impairments, whether they run through the P&L or not. So you will get that updated information. But I assure you, this is where the magic happens. If you get this wrong, it is a big negative. If you get this right, it provides competitive advantage. What we seek to do in retirement services across the entirety of the portfolio is to earn 40 basis points across a portfolio better than the comparable publicly traded investment grade option set or opportunity set. It's not 200 more, it's 40 more, and it is primarily a fixed income investment grade portfolio that benefits from stepping back from the fully liquid markets.\nScott Kleinman: The only thing I'd add Mike is just as a reminder, Apollo today manages 100% of the left side of Athene\u2019s balance sheet, right. So there's an Apollo professional who knows every single thing is tied to every line item on the Athene asset balance sheet. So the same care and feeding we provide across our entire credit business is already being done with respect to Athene. And so the actual closing of the merger, nothing changes in that respect.\nPeter Mintzberg: I believe we are coming to our last question in the pipeline.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Gerry O'Hara with Jeffries.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Alright. Thanks for taking the question. And perhaps just to mix it up a little bit, maybe you can give us an update on just the real estate segment. I think historically, there's been some frustration around the growth trajectory of that business. And Marc, maybe you can kind of give us a sense of how you see this segment growing forward, whether there's still an appetite for inorganic growth, or just what your kind of general thoughts are on real estate? Thank you. \nMarc Rowan: Okay. So I'll start and then I will pass it to Scott and Martin, if they have anything to add. But I'm going to start with something that will be surprising. We have an immense real estate business. Martin, will give you a better exact number but we're 50 billion of real assets. They're just not located in one place. A lot of it is located in lending and a lot of it is located in our European principle finance business, and then in our net lease business, and then in our U.S. opportunistic business, and in our Asian and Indian opportunistic and structure products business. It's harder to find as one line item. But it also goes back to philosophy about how we think about the business. We think about the business in three buckets; opportunistic, hybrid, and yield. Real assets cuts across all three of those buckets. You will find real estate across all three buckets. I will say reflexively we are sizeable but not immense in opportunistic real estate. That is primarily a function of our own risk reward and view of the marketplace and skill set. You will find us really large in hybrid and in yield across real estate, which is a function of our risk reward and our skill set.  I would expect real assets broadly defined to continue to be an incredibly important part of what we do. I think you will see real assets mixed into platforms, which we call yield and yield you will see it in our hybrid business, you will see it in our structure products business, and you will see it to a lesser extent in our opportunistic business and we have absolutely no qualms about being acquisitive in this area. And I would expect that we will be acquisitive in this area. I think one of the things that we will do on Investor Day is drop down below the broad line items of yield and hybrid and opportunistic and provide the requisite pie charts, which allow people to see just how big this real assets business is, and how big the origination businesses are. And otherwise, because I think it will surprise people that we've just come at this in a different way than others. But the fact that we're coming at it differently shouldn't surprise anyone.\nScott Kleinman: Yeah, the only thing I would add, I mean, Marc summed it up well. I mean, we see the opportunity set as actually really great in this space. And, when we do sort of break out the detail for you, you'll see that this business will more than double in the timeframe that we're talking about the five-year timeframe. And so there's just -- we're seeing it in the opportunity set that each of these businesses that Marc talked about the investment opportunities that that they're approaching right now. And so the ability for scaling is enormous and it's a place that we're focused on. So I would expect to see that as we continue to report over the coming quarters and years.\nPeter Mintzberg: I want to thank you all for attending. I'm glad we were able to take everyone's questions. I know we were 14 minutes over deadline and we try and be hyper punctual. So we will take feedback as to whether the extension is something you want to see us continue to do in the future and enjoy your day.\nOperator: This concludes our call. Thank you for joining us today.",

            "content": "Thanks Mark and thank you all for joining us this morning. As Mark mentioned, Apollo differentiates itself by the ability to generate excess returns across the entire risk reward spectrum. In this quarter, we again demonstrated the strength of this proposition across our platform. When I think about the overall performance of the business, I break it down into five key factors; finding good investments to deploy capital, having the portfolio accrete and value, monetizing our investments, raising more capital, and investing in and growing both our existing platforms as well as our new ones. So far in 2021, Apollo has made very good progress across all of these areas. So let me get through them one by one.  Regarding deployment, our ability to find attractive returns at all points along the risk spectrum shines in an environment like the one we're in now where valuations are seemingly high for private equity and yields are painfully thin for most credit products. Total deployment for Q1 was 24.9 billion. Our private equity funds deployed 2.4 billion in capital in the quarter. Additionally, we committed to deploy a further 3.3 billion in the quarter driven by two large Fund IX investments Michaels and the Venetian. And since quarter end, we've continued to commit to significant additional transactions. We continue to see a strong recovery in the economy, particularly in those sectors hardest hit by COVID such as leisure, travel, gaming, and specialty retail and we continue to invest in those spaces. Our hybrid value business continues to be active with over $0.5 billion deployed in the quarter.  Strong deployment of 19.1 billion in our credit business in the first quarter was in line with fourth quarter levels and includes strong insurance balance sheet growth on insurance inflows and pension risk transfer transactions. With spreads tight, others are going down in quality to earn returns but we've been moving up in credit quality and finding our returns through superior asset selection and origination. This will set us up well in the future. We're preparing for, but not predicting higher rates to come. Our initiative to seek increased high-grade alpha origination transactions continues to grow and has a robust pipeline. We continue to see substantial opportunities to provide capital and funding solutions to corporations and financial institutions globally with the ability and expertise to find innovative solutions and structures. Also, we are now fully in the European direct loan market committing to $1 billion in the first quarter. This is a space we weren't present a year ago.  And lastly JCPenney has agreed to transfer 2.8 billion in pension obligations for roughly 30,000 participants in JCPenney's pension plan to Athene as part of a pension transfer transaction. Athene utilized its strategic capital vehicle ACRA to support the completion of this transaction. In terms of value creation this has been an exceptional quarter for Apollo. Marc just mentioned our very strong track record in private equity for over 31 years. We continue to show that we have an ability to find attractive returns in any market environment. We continue to believe that purchase price matters and we will utilize our expertise to creatively source structure and optimize assets, adding value in partnership with our growing in-house operations team of experts. This can clearly be seen in our most recent and largest funds Fund IX. We're seeing very strong performance in this fund with the current marks up 33% leading to an IRR of 49% gross, 26% net, and a MOIC of 1.7 times. While we expect these numbers to converge over time towards historic levels, we see the results as a validation of our investment expertise and of the fact that this continues to be a very high return business, if done the right way. In a market characterized by indexation, correlation, and volatility, Apollo's investment discipline really stands out.  During the quarter our overall private equity segment appreciated by 22% as compared to the S&P at 5.8% driven by exceptionally strong performance across our funds public and private holdings. Fund VIII and Fund IX appreciated by 19% and 33% respectively, driving an increase in the net carry asset to $3.04 per share up from a $1.82 per share in the fourth quarter. Importantly, Fund VIII returned to paying cash carry and the netting whole of the funds has been eliminated. Fund VIII is now market a multiple of invested capital of 1.8 times and we expect it to continue to grow and create value as the portfolio matures. As a reminder, Fund IX crossed into carry in the fourth quarter of last year and as of the first quarter, it is in full carry. Our hybrid value fund is delivering strong performance with gross IRR of 31%, 25% net, and MOIC of 1.3 times. We also experienced strong performance with our infrastructure equity fund in the quarter up 15%. In credit our funds aggregate portfolio returned 4% during the quarter, 1.9% above the benchmark. Notably, our global corporate credit business generated a 3% total return in the quarter, reflecting over 80 basis points of outperformance to its benchmark. In addition the performance of structured credit exceeded the index by approximately 400 basis points for the quarter and our credit strategy fund generated 5% in the quarter, 150 basis points above its index. Our strong credit performance has been driven in part by the excess spread we've been able to generate for our insurance and other clients, which stems from our differentiated and expanding origination capabilities.  Regarding realizations, we saw a strong monetization of our investments with $3.7 billion of capital returned to LPs in the first quarter. The total capital return to LPs over the last 12 months adds to $10.4 billion. We announced several large transactions this quarter, including the highly successful IPO of Sun Country, a Fund VIII portfolio company, the merger of Tech Data, a Fund IX portfolio company with Synnex, the sale of AmeriHome owned by Athene and several Apollo Funds to Western Alliance, and NGO Energy Partners through our yield business. We have a strong pipeline and expect to continue generating strong monetization for our investors.  On fundraising, this quarter we raised a significant amount of capital from third party investors near the high end of the $15 billion to $20 billion annual range we have discussed in the past. All in all, we've made great progress with our investors over the quarter and for the most part they have been incredibly supportive of all the recent changes at Apollo. We have several fundraising capital in the market now and closed on $4.8 billion in the quarter. In addition, we saw inflows of 4.2 billion from our insurance affiliates with total inflows for the quarter of 13.4 billion. We also see a huge opportunity to expand our distribution in the wealth management channel and are building now the capability to do that. We are confident in our fundraising targets for the year and have already raised over 2 billion since quarter end.  Lastly, with respect to investing in our platform and growth, to echo Marc's comments, we see incredible opportunities to accelerate growth and are investing in the business. It is an exciting time to be in the asset management business. Capital flows are concentrating towards a select few players who can provide the breadth of products and services that investors are looking for and that trend is only accelerating and creating new winners and losers. We see an enormous opportunity ahead of us and we're planting the right seeds to take advantage of many of these growth opportunities. We're adding over 400 employees this year across all parts of our business. We're growing our core product teams and building capabilities to scale our platform and increase our ability to generate excess returns across several areas, including infrastructure, impact investing, credit and GP Secondaries, direct origination, capital markets and syndication, and SPACs just to name a few.  As we build these growth engines we're also continuing to build the enterprise solutions seems to support this growth. We're confident, confident that this type of investment will produce at least mid-teens growth in FRE over the long term, with some fluctuations between low teens and high teens, depending on investment opportunities in any given year. We believe the path forward is bright for Apollo and we're excited to continue on this strong trajectory. I speak for the entire management team in expressing our gratitude for our deep bench of talent who've come together to drive the success that we've experienced so far this year. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin. No Ken it was, that's a long duration portfolio. So it's more sensitive to a rate backup. And so it was a combination of rates and the Euro given that most of the portfolio's in Euro. But as I said, like the impact was pretty muted. It's all in the numbers for the quarter. And then when you get away from that net, net higher rates are better for the platform, both in terms of investing assets and originating through the insurance platforms. Look, I would agree with Marc. While historically, Asia has not been a huge target area for Apollo because we've been able to pursue all the growth we want and find the market opportunities we're looking for in North America and Western Europe, we're not blind to the opportunity set. We are starting to make small inroads, as Marc said, in places like Japan and Australia, but I would expect to see more overtime, but on a measured basis. It's not something that we feel like we have to jump in tomorrow. But it is obviously a big dynamic market and one which over time we will continue to incrementally grow into. The only thing I'd add Mike is just as a reminder, Apollo today manages 100% of the left side of Athene\u2019s balance sheet, right. So there's an Apollo professional who knows every single thing is tied to every line item on the Athene asset balance sheet. So the same care and feeding we provide across our entire credit business is already being done with respect to Athene. And so the actual closing of the merger, nothing changes in that respect. Yeah, the only thing I would add, I mean, Marc summed it up well. I mean, we see the opportunity set as actually really great in this space. And, when we do sort of break out the detail for you, you'll see that this business will more than double in the timeframe that we're talking about the five-year timeframe. And so there's just -- we're seeing it in the opportunity set that each of these businesses that Marc talked about the investment opportunities that that they're approaching right now. And so the ability for scaling is enormous and it's a place that we're focused on. So I would expect to see that as we continue to report over the coming quarters and years."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Scott. For the first quarter, Apollo recorded exceptional results across all relevant financial and operating metrics. Our GAAP net income to common shareholders was $670 million or $2.81 per share in the first quarter, as compared with $0.44 per share for the full year 2020 and $3.71 per share for the full year 2019. We generated record FRE of $0.65 per share on a pretax basis, up 26% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth in management fees and an uptick in FRE performance fees related to our CLO manager. Management fees grew 3% over the prior quarter and 17% over the first quarter of 2020, driven by growth in fees for investing the assets of our insurance clients and deployment across our platform broadly.  Transaction and advisory fees were $56 million in the quarter, driven by capital solutions transactions and private equity activity. Though this represents a more normalized level than in recent quarters, it is nearly double the pre-2020 quarterly average, up 51% year-over-year and is more representative of the run rate we expect as our origination business further scales. Compensation expense was flat over the prior quarter. However, we expect this to grow over the next few quarters as we continue to invest in the growth initiatives that Scott outlined. Non-compensation costs fell 21% over the prior quarter as a result of both the seasonality and the absence of any one time items. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, non-comp was elevated due to costs related to the independent review. For the first quarter, we announced a dividend of $0.50 per share and after tax distributable earnings of $0.66 per share, supported by both our strong pre-tax FRE and net incentive earnings of $0.10 per share. After tax distributable earnings of $294 million were up 78% over the first quarter of 2020 and reflect the return of Fund VIII to paying cash carry.  Turning to AUM, we ended the first quarter at $461 billion up $6 billion quarter-over-quarter and $146 billion year-over-year. Inflows totaled $13 billion for the quarter reflecting robust fundraising of $5 billion for numerous strategies across the platform, organic growth at Athene, and growth in our CLO platform. The third party capital raised in the quarter is an indication that our relationships with LPs remain strong and we expect the majority of capital raised headwinds to now be behind us. For the first quarter fee generating AUM fell nominally due to interest rates driven markdowns on Athene and Athora\u2019s balance sheets. However, fee generating AUM grew 43% year-over-year supported by continued inflows and capital deployment. The impact on management fees of the markdowns of these balance sheets is largely reflected in the first quarter numbers and represents approximately 1% of management fees on an annualized run rate basis. While higher rates do reduce management fees on Athene\u2019s existing assets, we believe that higher rates are a net positive for Athene and Apollo given increased origination volumes and an ability to earn higher income on deployment into new assets.  Turning to incentive realizations, we recognized $107 million of gross performance fees for the first quarter, primarily related to monetization activity in Fund VIII and our hybrid value fund in our private equity business. As Scott mentioned, the impairment netting whole in Fund VIII has been eliminated as of the end of the first quarter, driven principally by secondary transactions of One Main, [indiscernible] and Sun Country. Fund VIII has a multiple un-invested capital of 1.8 and a current gross and net IRR of 18% and 13% respectively. The callback obligations of $0.17 per share that we report in our earnings release are related to older legacy funds, including Fund V and some older credit funds and specific to those funds and not cross collateralized across other funds. We do not expect these callback amounts if materialized to become cash obligations for at least several years from now.  Deployment in our drawdown funds was $2.7 billion in the first quarter and our pipeline across the platform remains robust as we have significant equity commitments on announced transactions in our private equity business. Our broader measure of deployment, which reflects the breadth of our origination business was again strong at $25 million in the first quarter. Deployment was driven by strong growth in insurance clients, including repositioning the assets acquired from Jackson, investments in our syndicated loans business, as well as middle market and commercial real estate lending activity. Now dry powder for investments across our fund complex was $50 billion at the end of the quarter of which $24 billion has the potential to drive management fees upon investment.  Apollo remains in a very strong liquidity position with approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity available on our balance sheet. Our net economic balance sheet value after debt and preferred stock was approximately $8 per share at March 31, up over $3 quarter-over-quarter primarily due to an increase in our total net performance fees, as well as an increase in value of our investment in Venerable, our variable annuity platform related to a transaction with Equitable. To echo Marc and Scott, we're very pleased with our first quarter earnings, driven by exceptional investment performance, growing fee earnings, and continued deployment and realization activity across the platform. We look forward to further accelerating growth in our platform, including via our announced merger with Athene and creating a corporate structure which will create flexibility to allocate capital to further growth at any of our businesses, which are returned to shareholders.  Lastly, we understand the desire for more specifics surrounding the announced merger with Athene, including performance segment financials and we look forward to providing that to you in conjunction with an Investor Day which we can't anticipate holding in the fall. With that I'll turn the call back to Peter. Sure. So as you probably understand, the retail channel is somewhat different than the traditional institutional channel, and requiring additional sales force, additional product development, and that's really the crux of it, investing in that space to support both existing products as well as new products to flow through those channels. So that's really the crux of the investment. Yes. GAAP, like in everything else will eliminate all intercompany transactions. We'll give you a detailed -- we've taken our best guess at providing our view as to how we're going to report through our lens deck that is on our website and that we've previously disclosed. We anticipate that from a management view financials, we will report the way everyone else in the industry and the broader financial services industry reports intercompany segments, which is the fair value of management fees will be reported on the asset management side and the yield less the cost of these management fees will be reported on the insurance side. We do anticipate at this point continuing to report DE and as you see through our lens deck, we're envisioning the addition of an additional operating line of retirement services. No Marc, -- so translating that into the components of FRE management fee growth should be changed in line with what we've produced, we see no reason that that won't continue in the future. We are very focused on growing our origination businesses and growing our transaction fees as you have seen and we expect that to continue. And then we make decisions about investing in the platform. And so that translates into low double-digits or high-teens for growth year-to-year and Marc has sort of indicated what we expect this year but looking forward where we're confident that we'll be able to produce every FRE dollar growth consistent with what we've produced in the past, regardless of the channel that it comes from. Sure, so I would say obviously when we look at Apollo's product platform, certainly yield products are going to be the place we lead into the global wealth channel. And that we're already making inroads there. I think it's still early days to see sort of substantial move the line item type results, but really we look at this over a two, three, four-year investment period, where by that timeframe you'll see meaningful progress there. But in the meantime, it's about taking products we have, getting it through the retail channel, and continuing to develop and tailor products that we learn are more specifically targeting those components. The other thing I'd say is, assets and liabilities are match. So, equity in both of those businesses continue to grow through the quarter. When you report assets, you're just looking at one half of the equation. Okay, so first, for the retirement services business, the issue and the risk has always been on the asset side. That is where I believe investors should focus, that is where we have focused. There's very little volatility around I'll call traditional measures of insurance type risk, like mortality and longevity or unexpected optionality on the part of policyholders. It is primarily an asset risk game. We have grown up and the entire firm has grown up with Athene by a relatively simple philosophy. Retirement services, insurance companies are a terrible place to take credit risk. They're a terrible place to take equity risk. But they are ideally situated to take some amount of liquidity risk since most of their liabilities are illiquid, and structure risk. And that is what you find on the Athene balance sheet. So we've now been through 12 years, there's 12 years of metrics. There's not whatever cycles have taken place in those 12 years we have written out. And you can look at our portfolio and I would encourage you to benchmark it not against other annuity companies, take the highest quality, best thought of peer group and I gave some of this through our lens deck, take proof, take met, take principle. And you will see whether it's a measure of losses, of capital buffer, of use of leverage, or anything else we have outperformed the double A benchmarks.  We have always been, Apollo has always been the residual equity holder of the risks that we take. Initially we were a 35% equity holder, some 2.5 billion of value. And now we are going to be 100% equity holder. The risk mentality mindset has not changed. So now I focus down into the specifics of your question, we do put out extensive credit decks. If you go back and you look at the period just after the lock downs in the U.S., you will see an extensive deck on our CLO portfolio, you will see an extensive deck on our CRE portfolio, you will see one on energy, you will see one on aircraft lending. And we will continue to do this. The granularity of information that we put out, there's nothing else like it in the insurance industry that I am aware of. This is how we run and monitor the business. We report on a quarterly basis impairments, whether they run through the P&L or not. So you will get that updated information. But I assure you, this is where the magic happens. If you get this wrong, it is a big negative. If you get this right, it provides competitive advantage. What we seek to do in retirement services across the entirety of the portfolio is to earn 40 basis points across a portfolio better than the comparable publicly traded investment grade option set or opportunity set. It's not 200 more, it's 40 more, and it is primarily a fixed income investment grade portfolio that benefits from stepping back from the fully liquid markets."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you Peter and welcome all. Q1 2021 was a strong quarter for Apollo. Record FRE of 287 million or $0.65 a share up 26% year-over-year, up 4% sequentially. Total inflows of 13 billion, excuse me, fund driven by 5 billion of fund raising and 4 billion of Athene organic growth. AUM of 461 billion up 145 billion year-over-year, 46% year-over-year and 6 billion quarter-over-quarter reflecting 13 billion of inflows, 9 billion of positive marks on the PE portfolio, partially offset by reductions in the yield portfolios at Athene and Athora due to rising rates and changing position of the Euro. Our opportunistic businesses had a particularly strong quarter as they are positioned for a strong U.S. and European recovery. The PE portfolio in particular was up 22% versus an S&P of 5.8%.  Scott, I know will take you through more details including deployment and realizations, and Martin will take you through the financials. As I discussed on our last earnings call, I had some simple observations on our business and by extension our strategy. We are in our growth business. This quarter and the year-over-year results make this abundantly clear. We provide a product that is in high demand. We provide excess returns to investors on a risk adjusted basis. We serve a growing market driven primarily by the need for retirement income. We serve this market directly through our Athena and Athora affiliates and indirectly through our institutional clients, our pension funds, retirement system, sovereign wealth funds, and others. The demographics and market trends of our market, aging indexation, low rates, need for retirement income mean that in general the business gets better every day.  We recognize how fortunate we are to be in a growth business. If you dig down to the next level, if you look at our largest business, our yield business, which is more than 330 billion of our AUM, that business is not limited in its growth by capital or liabilities. It is limited in its growth by assets, and that limitation is only temporary. It is our job and therefore our strategy to expand our capacity to generate assets that provide interesting risk reward for this segment of the market. In our hybrid and opportunistic businesses it is a little bit more balanced. Some of our strategies still have substantial room to expand by expanding their access to capital because the front end of those businesses is just so strong.  Apollo's unique value proposition is that we are exceptionally good at generating excess returns across a very broad swath of the risk return spectrum from investment grade to private equity. Examples of excess return across this very broad spectrum, not over one year but over a very long period of time, I think are instructive. In private equity, our 31-year return is 39% gross, 24% net with every core private equity fund having generated carry an incredible track record, which puts us substantially ahead of the top quartile PE performance. It's not any one fund, it's not the size of fund, it's not any one investment cycle, it is the discipline of the franchise and what we do and I know Scott will spend time walking you through the returns of the most recent fund and how we approach our opportunistic businesses. In our yield business I believe the best example of our capacity to generate excess return is manifested by examining our largest client, Athene. If you look Athene since inception over more than the past decade, their ROE and their insurance businesses is 22% and on a consolidated basis 15% on average over this period of time. This is substantially in excess of any comparable company or comparable index.  In the context of this background, this quarter was all about reinforcing strategy, building our front end or capacity to generate additional assets, and positioning us to grow faster. The biggest step in the quarter was obviously our decision to enter into an agreement to merge with Athene. This transaction massively reinforces our position serving retirement income and retirees, adding almost a million clients including our pension retirement transfer business, and average age in the high 60s. This transaction adds to our capacity and coordination to develop additional yield platforms through aligning Apollo and Athene. Thinking back to what we have been able to achieve with us not fully aligned, whether it is our mid-cap corporate credit business, our triple net lease business, our aircraft finance business, our Redding Ridge structured products business, the list goes on and on. I'm excited as to what we can achieve with full alignment.  In our hybrid and opportunistic businesses, this transaction increases our ability to see products and to see teams and to launch new funds and simply to get to market faster. Some examples of what we've done historically include our hybrid value fund, our infrastructure fund, and numerous others. The transaction also represents a significant strengthening of our connection to additional forms of distribution, including retail banks, independent broker dealers, and other wealth channels. These wealth distribution channels represent a significant source of growth for us and we expect 2021 even prior to the closing of the transaction with Athene to be a record year for Apollo in these channels and a source of significant future growth.  The merger was not the only step we took in the quarter to reinforce our strategy. Significant progress was made in our high grade alpha business. Apollo has developed a unique platform to provide capital and funding to large corporations globally in the investment grade market. Our unconstrained appetite for long-dated creative and semi-liquid solutions have allowed us to execute multi-billion dollar transactions in a short timeframe as a sole counterparty to these corporations. Working with our partners, with our 400 plus investment professionals, we expect to generate 15 billion to 20 billion of these transactions in 2021. Also in the quarter, we announced the launch of our Credit Secondaries business, a new platform levering our insurance affiliates appetite for this asset class into a very fast growing private Credit Secondaries market. This is one of the first funds in this rapidly growing split space and we plan to raise substantial additional money in the future for this strategy as we continue to build out our general partnership solutions capabilities.  In summary, this is an investment year. We're focused on setting the business up so that it grows faster over the next five years and Scott will take you through some of the investments we're making during 2021 in his prepared remarks. Away from the financials of the business and the strategy of the business, we delivered the changes in governance that we had set out in our first -- in the first conference call I had done with you. We began to implement changes to our governance to establish a simpler, more transparent corporate structure we believe ultimately positions us to be eligible for S&P index inclusion.  In closing the business is firing on all cylinders. We're making tremendous progress, and I'm very optimistic about growth. I want to take this moment to thank over 1700 Apollo employees around the world, including 59 new hires in Q1 who worked tirelessly to achieve the results we have announced today. Culturally the senior management team is focused on positioning the firm to speak authentically about what we can achieve and what we can particularly have an impact on. We are very focused on expanding opportunity, particularly for broader segments of society that here to for may not have that access to the same opportunities. We can do this at Apollo, we can also do this through our portfolio companies. More to come on this in the near future.  Our efforts around citizenship, diversity, equity, inclusion, and ESG are core to our value proposition for our people and we continue to raise awareness and deepen education on the key issues. In January, we received a score of a 100% from the human rights campaign foundation, with regard to being the best place to work for LGBTQ equality. Yesterday, we announced a significant donation to United Way India's Partner Act to immediately deploy thousands of oxygen concentrations and other critical life saving medical equipment to those in most need. Our hearts go out to the Apollo community in India and their loved ones who are experiencing the impact of this crisis. With that I will now turn it over to Scott. Well, a lot there Bill, I'll do my best. First, if you step back and think about what we're trying to do, the yield business that we have built, you should think of as a fixed income replacement business, rather than an opportunistic credit business. We liked that notion because what we're doing is we're trying to provide to our clients Athena, Athora, as well as our third party clients and credit funds 150 to 200 basis points of excess return around the high-end, particularly the investment grade end of that fixed income marketplace. The way we do that is not by taking incremental credit risk, not by taking equity risk. We derive that return from two factors; one is structure, and the other is the willingness to accept illiquidity. For a regular way plain vanilla transaction, issuers will go to the investment grade market, the corporate market in a very methodical, easy to access way and there is not excess return. But if you look at the end of last year, and you look at the Hertz transaction, you look at the ADNOC transaction and you look at the Anheuser-Busch bottling transaction what you see are three different issuers, all approaching different problems, all in the investment grade end of the spectrum that required a solution.  We are one of the few participants who have the size, scale, and capacity to take down sizeable investment grade transactions. And so that is what we are seeking to do. I mean, the most fundamental we want 150 to 200 basis points of excess return over the comparably traded public IG, and we're willing to provide flexibility and structure and willing to accept the liquidity. This is a role that Q4 might have been provided by some of the largest banks or investment banks and I think increasingly we will get our share of this marketplace and it represents a very attractive marketplace and fits very synergistically with all that we do in fixed income replacement given that we cover a very large swath of the investment grade market anyway. It's a very different business than the peer set as a result of our unique client base. So I'm going to give you a broader answer, its Marc and if it doesn't suffice, you'll have to follow-up. So Apollo itself, just the asset manager is a highly cash generative business. As you know, we have announced the reset of our dividend to initially $1.60 per share, which we've said will grow along with the growth in the business. Just on that basis the distributable earnings of Apollo more than covers the dividend and makes it very clear that the Apollo business is very cash generative. Your starting point on Athene I believe to be too conservative. If you look back in history, Athene has actually distributed an immense amount of capital. They've just not distributed it as dividends, they've done it in terms of buybacks. They've distributed I don't have my notes in front of me, but call it 1.250 million [ph] plus or minus over a period of time. So now you have to step back and think about how Athene produces cash on a go-forward basis. Athene as you've said yes, it finances its own growth, but it also starts in a different place. It does not start at zero. Athene starts with 5.2 billion of excess equity capital, which is approximately 3.8 billion of excess equity on Athene\u2019s balance sheet plus 1.7 in a just in time LP driven side-by-side funding vehicle called ADF [ph].  In addition, Athene has less than 15% debt to cap whereas it's AA peers would have about 25% debt to cap again, approximately another 2.5 billion. So Athene starts with about 7.5 billion to 8 billion of excess deployable capital and what you're also watching is a maturation of the structure. The business rolling off Athene is generally business that is rolling off that was financed 100% with Athene\u2019s capital. That's how Athene began life. The business going on the books is generally going on the books, particularly the inorganic and PRT business, but likely over time the totality of Athene\u2019s business will be approximately one third of Athene\u2019s capital, and two thirds ADF capital. What we have tried to do is balance, is to take what here to four may have been a capital intensive business, make it less capital intensive through the introduction of third-party capital, which as an aside, the ADF One investors should be very happy. I'll leave it there and you should anticipate that we'd be very focused on ADF too, to support this growth.  And so it is my expectation that we will get excess capital from the Athene leg of the business and excess capital from the Apollo leg of the business against an announced $1.60 dividend. I think for Investor Day, we will do our best to go through this in detail, but suffice it to say that capital allocation is one of the things that is fully within our control and is something we should be judged on and we are all very large shareholders. But what it does is it creates options and that option is to reinvest in the business, adding additional capacity, and/or buy back stock. And we will look at that and now have the flexibility to do that every quarter and every year. Yeah, sure. So I think you are basically exactly right. The growth in credit funds over the last five, six, seven years has really been meteoric as you all know. And the reality is CIO's funds, pension funds are ultimately needing liquidity as they balance their portfolios is just the way this occurred for the private equity business 10 to 15 years ago. The real secret sauce if you will in a Secondaries business is having the knowledge of the underlying investments to be able to move rapidly and thoughtfully around making investment decisions. And because Apollo is the largest alternative credit lender, we have views and visibility on essentially every credit product, every underlying security in the market. And so our ability, our library of knowledge to be able to smartly access this market is really unparalleled. There's really no one of scale in this space right now, but we can already start to see the demand from pension funds, others who hold these credit funds to be able to seek liquidity. So we think this is a massively scalable market where we have real first mover advantage and real expertise to allow us to be the category killer in this space. No, I think directionally that's right. Remember, when we think about this, this type of business is very applicable for some of our existing insurance clients and otherwise. So it gives us the ability to scale rapidly and opportunistically. But you are right, the third party demand should be pretty enormous and would expect to see this business scale faster than like say a PE type fund. So Alex this is Marc, I'll give you the broader overview and then I'll turn it to Martin. So, I think we've said broadly first. We will update our targets at our next Investor Day, but the way, at least some of us think about the business, the yield business, we think we can double over the next five years, that's circa 350 billion today. I think that'll be a $700 billion plus business, and I'll come back to why and how. The opportunistic business and the hybrid business is about 110 billion and 115 billion. And at least at first blush, I personally think they will be 50% larger over the next five years. So now to dig down and then I will turn it over to Martin for a bit, if you look at the strategy we've chosen in yield, it's in many ways a different strategy than our comparable peer set. We've chosen as I alluded to on an earlier question, fixed income replacement. This was driven by the need to serve our insurance affiliates. It also, if you look at roughly the 350 billion of AUM, about 60% of that is driven by the insurance affiliates, and 40% is driven by a third party clients and credit funds. I have no reason to expect that to change all that much as the business doubles, but let me get into what I mean by doubling the business.  If you dig down in the 350 billion, my best guess is it's 125 billion to 150 billion of alpha with the remainder beta. For us to double that business, we need to double 125 billion of alpha. That is a large number but it does not appear daunting to me, because a lot of it is focused on platforms providing repeatable origination. So to give you a sense of scale, we originated 17 billion of credit in the first quarter. We're on pace to do circa 75 billion to 80 billion for the year and that's up from last year where we did 47 billion of credit origination for the year. So we kind of seem to have the building blocks in place.  On the opportunistic side, I laid out the larger return, Scott laid out some of the more specific returns, and we've made a lot of progress with announced private equity transactions, I would expect that next year we'll be in the market for Fund XI, excuse me, Scott's correcting me. And we are in the process of scaling a number of other strategies, where we see origination capacity in excess of funds that we currently have, Asian real estate on our Asia structure and product business, infrastructure, social impact. So all in all I see really interesting ways to grow the business. Some of this and you've asked for excluding insurance affiliates, I don't really think of the business in that context because increasingly, what our limited partners and third party investors like on the yield side of our business, is the ability to co invest side by side with Athene and Athora same time, same price, same risk. We present ourselves to the market as an asset manager, who is not only interested in fee but is interested in the underlying asset and therefore full alignment.  On the opportunistic and the hybrid side of the business we are also in the same position although not to the same degree, whereas we might be 60% of the yield from affiliates. On the yield side of our business we're probably -- I will use the back of the envelope 15% to 30% of the business on the hybrid and opportunistic side of the business. Again, these are accelerants to growing because limited partners and other third party investors like that we have skin in the game and we eat our own cooking whatever your best analogy is. When we have previously come to talk to you, we speak to this business as a business that is roughly a 15% annual growth business. In years like this, my gut tells me FRE will be double-digits but below 15 as in this is investment year and in years, once we've made the investment it will be beyond 15%. But that's kind of the metric we hold ourselves to subject to update at Investor Day. The things we are doing are generally designed to help us get beyond that. Martin anything you want to add. Maybe, it's Marc, I'll add and I'll step back. Look, there is a trend towards what we say is democratization of finance. That trend was more pronounced under Republican administration, it likely will be less pronounced under a democratic administration. But nonetheless, it is a trend and it's a trend we expect to continue. We see increased sophistication in the retail and the high net worth channels. And so if you step back, and you look at from our point of view, we have for a very long time been a distributor of opportunistic product to the high net worth channel, through private equity and a number of the other funds. What you will see us do in that channel is continue to do what we've been doing, to build it out to redouble our efforts we have made significant hires in these areas. And we intend to follow through and I would think on balance, you will see greater fundraising coming out of this channel this year, next year and in the future. And I do think that this is a trend, when we look back over the next five or 10 years, we will see retail high net worth as a larger percentage of total opportunistic fundraise than it has been over the past decade.  Then I go to completely to the other end of the spectrum and let's talk about Athene. So Athene is now the number one underwriter of retail annuities in the U.S. It is a substantial footprint. The footprint includes independent broker dealer, it includes bank, it includes other forms of distribution that I would say are more retail and less high net worth. They have made the investments in systems and infrastructure necessary to support a complex product set and insurance is a complex product set. Even if this product set is all income based. What Scott is focused on is in between the two. I believe and Scott believes and Jim believes and the whole team believes that we have the opportunity to continue to package our yield oriented products in ways that can go through the high net worth and the retail channels. And the investments there have also been made in people and teams and will continue to be made. You will see us launch at the second half of this year, at least two products through this channel that are yield based.  Again, when we look back over the next five or 10 years and compare it to the past decade, we will see continued democratization of finance. Our job I believe is to come at this channel with our unique value proposition which is not simply to sell as much as we can, it is to focus on what I believe the franchise does extraordinarily well, which is excess return at every point along the risk reward curve from private equity down to investment grade. The products that we ultimately expand in high net worth in retail is a product set we can have our own designs, but it is ultimately up to the channel and the end consumer as to which of those products are more applicable and it's our job to make them available and make our capabilities available and support them with the requisite infrastructure via technology infrastructure or people in wholesale infrastructure to do. This should not be unknown. Others in our industry have done it. Others have quite frankly been there first and are bigger. And there's plenty of roadmap for us to follow, for us to use this as an accelerant to what we otherwise are doing and it seems very logical and obvious to us. So I'll do my best, its Marc. So in general, as Martin said, higher rates are better for our business. First, we have an investment portfolio that has a decent amount of floaters in it on the Athene balance sheet. And second, higher rates can also help in pricing of new business including, excuse me, company to company new business. But I don't actually think that rates themselves have material impact on the ability or willingness of people to transact. What we are watching is, in my opinion, a realignment of the guaranteed or as we say in the U.S. annuity led insurance business. You're seeing companies particularly companies who may not have the ability to create asset alpha, which is ultimately what drives the business. Sell large blocks of business, they sell this through reinsurance, they sell this through company sales. And for the most part, it is being sold to people who have the capacity to generate alpha amongst assets that are appropriate for insurance company balance sheets, which tend to be investment grade or quasi investment grade assets. I see no lead up in that trend. And I think this rotation, out of guaranteed yield and into mortality, PNC and fee for service in both the U.S. and Western Europe is healthy. Our business in my opinion will not be limited in growth by our ability to source liabilities, only by prudence with respect to returns. And here I will give you a little more color.  Athene last year when they announced their fourth quarter, they gave some indication as to the profitability of the retail business they were generating. Typically, they have done between 15% and 20% cash on cash unlevered for new retail annuity business. Last year was at the higher end of that range. They will report on Friday and will give some notion of the profitability of business in the first quarter. If we are return maximizers or we are trying to build a long-term sustainable business, we should want to garner the lowest cost of funds, and therefore the highest level of repeat profitability for a decade for our retirement services business. Our ability to generate profitability at retail which is the lowest risk, most repeatable, most franchise nature, does put a floor on our willingness as to what we're prepared to pay for large blocks of annuities. It's not just about growth, it's about sustainable, profitable growth, and not simply just growing the business for the sake of growing the business. So the message I would convey, there are immense blocks of business that will trade hands. The blocks of business in the U.S. are well known. The blocks of business in Europe, in my opinion, are larger and less well known. And very few people have the platform that we have to be able to consolidate those blocks of business. In any one quarter you can see blocks trade or not trade but we will continue to be focused on underwriting profitable new business rather than new business. Its Marc, I'll lead off. Always uncomfortable to talk about myself, but we'll do our best. So, I am the CEO of the business. The lanes I have picked out for myself are strategy, culture which includes compensation, communication, urgent strategic initiatives, and dealing with problems. I am fortunate to be able to rely on an incredibly talented group led by Jim Zelter and Scott Kleinman, who run the day to day of the Apollo business. They in turn have their own next generation that makes their job easier. At retirement services, at pro forma for consolidation, you have a business that is led by Jim Belardi, Bill Wheeler, Marty Klein, Grant Kvalheim, all of whom have been there a long period of time and I've worked with on a day to day basis.  If you step back and really think about the business, there's been a lot of external change. But I try not to lose sight that we actually grew the business by 145 billion in a year. Most of the change that's taken place has actually taken place within the business. And what is external, is mostly noise for us. This is now my 31st year at Apollo, my 36th year in business. I grew up in the opportunistic side of the business for 20 of those years and I've grown up on the retirement services on the yield side of the business for the last decade plus. This is not a new job. It's very clear what we need to do. We are very focused on what it is that we define the firm. We define the firm as providing excess return at every point along the risk rewards spectrum that we choose to participate in. We have really good tailwinds, whether it's demographics, market structure, or otherwise. We have a strategy that is focused on the three business segments I've outlined, opportunistic which I think this group and on the phone understands the best, hybrid which is the middle between opportunistic and yield, and then yield.  Yield is by far and away the largest segment of our business, and the fastest growing segment of our business. And we have chosen a strategy that plays to our strengths, fixed income replacement. This is a trend that is -- it makes our business in many ways totally different than our peer set. First, it is an easier business to scale just by the nature of its business. Second, 60% of that scaling today has been through our affiliates. Third, we present ourselves to the market in a unique way as aligned with our partners, because we take $0.50 to $0.60 of every trade, same time, same price. So for the most part we go about our business and we execute. Yes, we have had changes in roles. Josh is less involved in compensation, which seems like a natural given that I'm now the CEO. Josh is an active and productive and senior member of the Apollo team. He's on the Board, he's on the executive committee, he chose our transaction committee, which reviews our largest opportunistic deals. We get up for business every day and we execute the plan. Okay, I'll take a shot at it, its Marc and then I'll hand it to Scott. So when you step back and you look at our business, there's no denying that our business is primarily focused on the U.S. and Western Europe, with a little bit in Australia and a little bit in Japan. That is the outline of our business and within the context of our strategy and what I've outlined of doubling our yield business and a 50% increase in our opportunistic business, I believe we can accomplish that within our geographies. Having said that, we have been active in the broader Asian market for a long period of time but we have not elected to move large opportunistic funds into those marketplaces. The unique calling card that I believe that we have leverage is the strength of the firm to provide capital where there is excess return. For me, I believe that excess return to be primarily in yield and in structure products. And you should expect us to use the things that we do best to differentiate ourselves in markets that are not short of capital and function quite differently than the U.S. and Western European marketplaces. Okay. So I'll start and then I will pass it to Scott and Martin, if they have anything to add. But I'm going to start with something that will be surprising. We have an immense real estate business. Martin, will give you a better exact number but we're 50 billion of real assets. They're just not located in one place. A lot of it is located in lending and a lot of it is located in our European principle finance business, and then in our net lease business, and then in our U.S. opportunistic business, and in our Asian and Indian opportunistic and structure products business. It's harder to find as one line item. But it also goes back to philosophy about how we think about the business. We think about the business in three buckets; opportunistic, hybrid, and yield. Real assets cuts across all three of those buckets. You will find real estate across all three buckets. I will say reflexively we are sizeable but not immense in opportunistic real estate. That is primarily a function of our own risk reward and view of the marketplace and skill set. You will find us really large in hybrid and in yield across real estate, which is a function of our risk reward and our skill set.  I would expect real assets broadly defined to continue to be an incredibly important part of what we do. I think you will see real assets mixed into platforms, which we call yield and yield you will see it in our hybrid business, you will see it in our structure products business, and you will see it to a lesser extent in our opportunistic business and we have absolutely no qualms about being acquisitive in this area. And I would expect that we will be acquisitive in this area. I think one of the things that we will do on Investor Day is drop down below the broad line items of yield and hybrid and opportunistic and provide the requisite pie charts, which allow people to see just how big this real assets business is, and how big the origination businesses are. And otherwise, because I think it will surprise people that we've just come at this in a different way than others. But the fact that we're coming at it differently shouldn't surprise anyone."

During today\u2019s discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode. And following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference call will open for questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin the queue. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which does not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's Web site. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNoah Gunn: Thanks, Donna, and a special thanks to a couple of members of the research community who selected two of the three songs for our hold music jukebox that was playing before we got on the line today. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site. In short, we\u2019re very pleased to deliver a strong set of results for 2022 that featured record fee-related earnings of $1.4 billion or $2.36 per share and record normalized spread-related earnings of $2.3 billion or $3.88 per share. This strong combination of fee and spread-related earnings alongside principal investing income drove total adjusted net income of $3.1 billion or $5.21 per share for the full year. Joining me this morning to discuss these results and our positive outlook on the business in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah, and good morning to all. 2022 was a transformational year for the firm. At the end of 2021, we held our first Investor Day and we set out our five-year targets and laid out what we needed to accomplish internally to achieve those targets. End of 2021 seems like a lifetime ago or at least a Fed regime or two ago. However, in 2022, we met or exceeded those targets. Record FRE of 1.4 billion was in line with our target and record normalized SRE of 2.3 billion was meaningfully ahead of target. As important and as we suggested, we restarted the growth engine. Inflows in 2021 were 75 billion. Inflows this year, 128 billion. Inflows for '23 will be higher. We expect a record year of capital raising in 2023. As I've often cautioned, capital raising is the reward for good performance. It is not actually the goal that we set out.  AUM ended the year at 548 billion, or X rates, and FX would have been about 565 billion, all in meaningful progress against our five-year targets. Recall that in Investor Day, we laid out three key objectives or three key pillars that we had to focus on to achieve our plan; global wealth, origination and capital solutions.  Global wealth had a really strong 2022. We ended the year with approximately 30 billion of AUM in our global wealth segment, including 6 billion of capital raised in 2022, accounting for and implementing successfully the Griffin acquisition during the mid part of the year. We are on track to meet or exceed our $50 billion target at the end of 2026. When we laid out these targets, we had zero perpetual products in the marketplace. By year end, we expect nine perpetual products in the marketplace. In short, we've had tremendous receptivity to our product and to our franchise in the global wealth community.  Our goal here, like the goal elsewhere in our organization, is not to be the biggest. We will not necessarily be the fastest growing. We will be seen and are seen as the innovator in this marketplace, showing the global wealth community the kinds of products that they have never seen before and addressing the unique needs of this interesting constituency.  Origination volume totaled north of 100 billion on a 12-month basis. We now have 15 platforms, including seven platforms, which were new additions during 2022. You will hear later in the call the most recent edition, Atlas, formerly known as the Credit Suisse securitized products group. We are definitely on track here to meet or exceed our $150 billion annual target at the end of 2026.  Having a steady source of unique credit production every year really enables us to power our business to make the kind of projections and predictability and the client commitments that are necessary for us to grow. This is good for our FRE business, in that it powers our third parties, particularly in private credit and it is especially good for our SRE business, in that we produce reliable amounts of excess spread, particularly in investment grade private credit.  I'm going to spend a second just on that term. We hear the term private credit a lot. We actually have no idea what the words private credit mean. They're just two words that will follow each other. What we have focused on in our platform and what we have done uniquely is to create a source of private investment grade credit. Very few people, very few organizations have that capability. This is in addition to the strength that the franchise has always had in more generic private credit. Jim will spend a lot of time on this in his remarks and it is a very important part of our franchise going forward and a huge differentiator.  The third pillar that we set out was our capital solutions business. Capital solutions in 2021 was approximately 250 million of annual revenue. And we suggested that at the end of 2026, we wanted that to be north of 500 million of annual revenue. In 2022, we exceeded 400 million of annual revenue. It gives me great confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed the five-year projections that we laid out at the beginning of 2021.  The team has been fully built out globally. We have a massive pipeline that we executed on partially in 2022, and will carry over into the first quarter of 2023, which Martin will touch on. And most important is to help understand and help explain the ecosystem that we are creating. 15 platforms, 15 companies whose only job is to produce credit wake up every day and do what they do, they produce credit.  We, as a diversified buyer of credit for our own balance sheet in SRE we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. And so what that means, we are creating every day credit that needs to be syndicated into the marketplace. Some of that goes into funds or to SMAs of clients who have previously come to the Apollo platform. The rest of it goes into our capital solutions business. This is a strategic imperative for us, and does two very interesting things.  One, as we place credit with third parties, we earn fees. Earning fees is a fundamental part of our business model. But as important, they are expanding our ecosystem. We have done business in the alternative community with investors with circa 3,500 counterparties for a long period of time. This is an opportunity with unique product with side-by-side with align product, with recurring product for our capital solutions group to go out and build new relationships. Sometimes those new relationships will result in one-off transactions, which is just fine. But oftentimes those new relationships will open up client's eyes as to what we can do, and we will turn those into SMAs and recurring revenues. This is an ecosystem that is picking up tremendous traction and the team here is doing an unbelievable job.  As excited as I am about the '22 performance against the three initiatives, I now want to turn to Athene who had just an awesome year. Inflows at Athene on an organic basis were some 48 billion. Athene was the number one purveyor of annuities in the United States, despite not being represented in a lot of annuity markets.  New business was put on the books in the fourth quarter at about 145 basis points of spread versus about 120 basis points of spread for the full year. Both of those targets are meaningfully ahead of what we would consider normal levels of business. 2023 I believe will also continue to be very strong. I doubt it will continue at the same levels that we saw in the fourth quarter. But new business is being put on the books very profitably.  Athene\u2019s alt portfolio, which as many of you also understand forms the foundation for AAA, our retail product, our equity replacement product was up 10% during the year versus the S&P benchmark, which was down almost 20%, very strong performance and an indication that Athene and AAA are doing something other than buying and providing clients with market beta. As we step back and we think about our positioning in this marketplace, one of the questions we ask the team who is the fortress balance sheet in our industry? And the answer is we are the fortress balance sheet in our industry. We are A plus across all three agencies. We ended the year 2 billion of excess capital and more than 1 billion ahead of S&P AA.  Some years ago we introduced was the first sizable reinsurance sidecar for our industry, affectionately known as ADIP1, with 3.25 billion of capital. That sidecar has now been nearly fully deployed. And yesterday or earlier this morning, we announced the first closing for ADIP2 of some $2 billion and we expect that ADIP2 will be larger than ADIP1. And further that ADIP2 will take an increased share of the new business that Athene puts on the books.  This is good all around. This is good for Athene from a capital generation point of view and a capital efficiency point of view, even though it will mean that some of their assets are now essentially belong to investors and they will realize the benefits of SRE growth. It is good for FRE and it is good for our origination franchises creating additional capacity that needs to be filled which will further spur the flywheel of our capital solutions and other businesses. In short, an amazing year for Athene.  Our success in this business of retirement solutions has not gone unnoticed. By some measure, there are now north of 100 asset management entities or insurance entities who have become asset managers pursuing a strategy similar to that which Athene started on 13 years ago. To be successful in this business and to understand where we sit relative to the rest of the business, I believe there are four things that contribute to success.  First is capital. Massive amounts of capital in an industry that has not been able to raise capital. The second is an ability everyday to create investment grade spread. This is something in a skill set that is not traditionally resonant within the alternatives industry, or quite frankly within traditional asset management. It is a skill that we have built up. The third is a really attractive cost structure. You need scale, because ultimately spread is a function of your net interest margin, but it's also a function of a very efficient cost base.  And finally, you need a very attractive cost of funds. If your cost of funds is low, because you're efficient and because your products are well designed, you do not need to take investment risk to earn good returns. And if you're a good investor, returns can actually be quite high. Everything goes in reverse if your cost of funds is very high.  What we are watching in our industry is the haves, like Athene, where we have some 48 billion of organic origination versus the have-nots, the market entrants, who in fact are paying up for inorganic blocks at very high cost of funds, which also are very expensive to administer on a hope that they will get to scale. I believe that the vast majority of new entrants, although not all, will not be successful and will learn a very expensive lesson along the way.  We are also in a period of time where the increased activity by asset managers has resulted in increased regulatory interest in what we are doing. We have spent 13 years creating the kinds of regulatory dialogues and transparency and putting out a best-in-class set of standards. We are, to my knowledge, not just a fortress balance sheet, but the most transparent of the companies.  We regularly publish stress tests, although we are not required. We regularly publish details of assets that we are not required. We regularly go back and forth with respect to our reinsurance so that people understand there is no \u201carbitrage\u201d between the U.S. regulatory standard and the Bermuda regulatory standard. All of the things I've just mentioned are not generally followed by many, although some are good actors of the new entrants.  What you will see in 2023 on our part is an increased foot forward to help lead this regulatory dialogue to make sure that we get to the right place with appropriate transparency and appropriate oversight. This is an amazing business that is driven by powerful trends, but it is also a business of promises to retirees. We expect that we will be included among a group of companies as internationally active insurance groups at some point in 2023, giving us an opportunity and a seat at the table to participate in shaping the regulatory future for our industry, which is changing very fast.  FRE for us is the flipside of FRE. The ability to generate safe yield is something that very few people have. Who need safe yield? Retirees need safe yield, pension funds, replacing a portion of their fixed income need safe yield, banks need safe yield, Japanese insurance companies and international investors need safe yield. The world is short safe yield. And we are very good at producing it. So when we produce it in an asset that is short, we want to maximize the profitability of our capability.  And then why I say that SRE is the flipside of that. We are FRE for the safe field we produce for third parties and for Athene. But then on top of that, we are an SRE or spread-related earnings by matching the safe yield with long-term sticky liabilities. In 2022, a number of other forms of so called permanent capital went in reverse. 2022 was an awesome year for Athene.  Let me step back and now return to a higher level view of our business. Our business, as I've suggested previously, exists and our industry exists to provide investors excess return per unit of risk. It does not exist for us to grow or for us to pursue that which we want. We are fundamentally responding to investor needs. Fortunately, we have very strong tailwinds as a firm and as an industry for the need for income, excess return per unit of risk.  Our business strategy is being driven and growth is being driven in areas where we believe we can continue to produce excess return per unit of risk. Our business is guided not just by excess return by unit of risk, but by an aligned investing philosophy. The combination of Athene and Athora in our balance sheet side by side with investors ensures investors at all points in time that we are fully aligned with them.  Finally, as I'm sure Jim will pivot on to, purchase price matters. The purchase price matters strategy is very hard to pursue in a risk-on everything rally [ph]. Nonetheless, we did that and the reward for doing that was certainly available and shown in 2022. But I believe the positioning we've taken out and our industry tailwinds really bode well for us going forward. 2023 will be a very good year for Apollo. We are on offense. We have 50 billion of dry powder across the platform. We deployed 160 billion in 2022. Fundamentally, we do better when markets are uncertain and when there is uncertainty in the economy. We expect FRE and SRE in 2023 to be up more than 20% over 2022, as I'm sure Martin will detail in his remarks.  But we also have an amazing opportunity in our business to really focus on operating leverage. We have enough in front of us with the initiatives that are currently on our plate to not just meet our 2023 goals but to meet our five-year targets. Alongside the three pillars of global wealth, origination and capital solutions, we have added a number of growth initiatives and I will not steal Jim Zelter's thunder as he lays out the things that are in front of us to focus on.  Suffice it to say, 2023 will be a year of execution. We will return the business to operating leverage in 2023 and again in 2024. The team here feels great. There's tremendous momentum. We are incredibly engaged and energized. And at the end of the day, what makes this a great place is the people.  This is a group of hardworking charitable people where the vast majority of the team, 93% are involved in our giving programs. And our job is to be the single best place to be a partner in the financial services industry. And with that, I want to thank the employees for an amazing year and the investors and analysts for all the time you've given us to understand what we're trying to do.  And with that, let me turn it over to Jim.\nJim Zelter: Thanks, Marc. As you've heard us say before, one of our core tenants is excess return per unit of risk. After 12-plus years of low rates and relatively free money, the best investors will begin to reveal themselves. And strong investment performance is the foundation of our business and we take our responsibility to provide differentiating returns to our clients quite seriously.  As we look out to 2023, we believe this is a particularly good time for Apollo to generate excess return. While other managers may be in a defensive position, we have been patiently waiting for this type of environment and we're confident there will be meaningful opportunities to deploy capital amid a heightened period of volatility and candidly a foggy capital markets backdrop.  Marc provided a high level update on our three key growth pillars, and I'd like to deep dive for a moment into origination. As we addressed at that Investor Day a short 16 months ago, a large portion of what we do is this high grade, fixed income replacement end of the market. Central to our strategy is the ability to originate a recurring supply of these durable assets. And one of the primary ways we do though is through these platforms, real operating businesses within a variety of industries.  Platform origination is clearly a differentiated way to originate these investment grades assets at scale, which is needed to grow our retirement services business profitably and increasingly to third party accounts that want the same alpha in their portfolio. Importantly, however, rather than expand HoldCo balance sheet resources, the capital used to purchase these origination platforms can be sourced via the normal course purchasing power of Athene\u2019s alt portfolio as well as AAA. At year end, our platform ecosystem was producing approximately 35 billion of annual volume and generating about 425 basis points of excess spread versus equivalent IG benchmarks. We've assembled this portfolio of 16 platforms across asset classes in sectors which had been acquired through a variety of funds we manage and also built organically, and we're now focused on scale and execution of those.  Metaphorically speaking, we pay the tuition to develop this important capability of scale, which we think is a great competitive advantage or MO [ph]. This advantage will expand following this week's or yesterday's announcement of the CS securitized products group platform, which has been renamed Atlas SP. This platform is a best-in-class asset-backed warehousing business, really a finance company of finance companies, with an extensive network of clients, an amazing 20-year track record of negligible losses.  The industry-leading team at Atlas is excited to be working with Apollo. And through the closing process, it's become clear that the variety of counterparties also want to work with the Apollo ecosystem. Many investors are reaching out to us as they expand their private credit exposure from direct lending into a broad base of asset-based finance capabilities. We think this is the largely untapped part of the 40 trillion IG fixed income replacement market. And simply put, we believe the opportunity to source resilient yield in asset-based finance is where sponsor finance was and private credit was 10 years ago.  In addition to the three growth pillars, we began to execute on six additional strategic initiatives that we've mentioned past. We've organized our efforts and resources around these initiatives, and now '23 is focused on execution. In this competitive fundraising landscape, our innovative and differentiated product offerings we believe will stand out. And we're seeing early indications of those facts.  And I'll mention a few here. We continue to be very optimistic on the growth of AAA or Apollo Aligned Alternatives. We're broadening the distribution system domestically through additional bank platform and a variety of other independent channels as well as globally to Asia and Europe. To note, we're launching our European product platform in the coming months, designed to offer a full suite of options to individuals in Europe, and AAA will be the first product available on that platform.  We've also begun marketing Athene Altitude [ph]. This is a product designed to offer a range of Apollo managed funds across this risk-reward spectrum, but to do so in a tax efficient vehicle. While still early, we raised 300 million in the fourth quarter from our first client, a third party insurance firm, to invest in AAA through Athene Altitude. Additionally, a couple of key organic initiatives in nascent asset classes are building scale.  Our sponsor and secondary solutions platform, named S3, has gained momentum following a cornerstone investment from [indiscernible] last year. This overall business has committed or deployed over 13 billion of capital since 2020, mainly in fund finance but has been committed over 1 billion into equity and credit secondaries over the past six months. And we expect formally to launch fundraising for an equity secondaries fund in the second quarter and opportunistically raise capital for our credit secondaries fund ahead of a dedicated fundraise in 2024.  We're seeing a similar story in our clean transition franchise. Since launching our sustainable investing platform about a year ago, we've committed or deployed over 6 billion of capital into these investments. And later this month, we will be adding a dedicated team for climate and infrastructure yield to further boost our origination capabilities across the board. And we anticipate launching fundraising for clean transition finance and opportunistic vehicles in the latter half of this year.  Next, we're bringing in the investment toolkit that has made Athene and Athora successful to others in the retirement services industry. Our proprietary origination volume has grown, as Marc said, in consistency and diversity. And now we're reaching a point where we can distribute more of these assets to third parties who have the same fundamental needs. We are building on a strong foundation of existing relationships in that area.  And over the next year, we aim to raise over $10 billion of capital from others in the retirement services space. And finally, we're replicating the successful sidecar structure we've had with MidCap and ADIP in a variety of other areas in our business and to do so in a simplified, cost effective manner to really scale and partner with the investors, as Marc mentioned, in the Apollo ecosystem.  Turning to our broader fundraising activities apart from these new six initiatives, our momentum on a variety of fronts is strong. In asset management, we had strong inflows and included 46 billion of third party fundraising, which doubled 2021 levels. In the fourth quarter specifically, total fundraising of 9 billion was driven by new capital for Athora income and incremental capital for a variety of drawdown fundraisers, co-investment capital, and in our global wealth, including 800 million for AAA.  Looking to '23, we expect a record amount of capital from third party investors exceeding the strong levels achieved last year. And we're already in the market with a range of drawdown funds, including our fourth vintage European principal finance, our third infrastructure fund, as Marc mentioned, ADIP2 and certainly our 10th vintage of our flagship private equity fund. Additionally, a variety of funds and manager accounts across the yield strategies that are currently raising capital, or will be later in the year similar to our Accord series as well as a variety of perpetual products, as Marc mentioned, in the global wealth channel, including the non-traded BDC, non-traded REIT and two interval funds.  Regarding Fund X fundraising, I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing broad support from the existing shareholder investor base and gaining traction with new investors, especially from non-U.S. regions and the global wealth channel. Through January, we've received commitments approximately 15 billion. And with congestion dynamics in the market, it's difficult to predict the ultimate size of the fund and exact timing. However, we expect to close on the majority of incremental commitments in the back half of the second quarter, and we believe the fund will land within striking distance of our target.  Coming into the new year, we believe investors are focusing on managers with healthy portfolios who had less exposure to growth-oriented sectors, which certainly bodes well for our long tenured strategy. It's worth noting that our private equity fund portfolios outperformed the S&P by over 25% in 2022 and our flagship PE Fund IX appreciated 22% during the year. Revenue and EBITDA trends remain strong in those portfolios, up mid-teens percent year-over-year across the broader fund portfolios.  Historically, and as you've heard, we've generated some of our best returns for investors and midmarket downturns and we're one of the few funds with a complete product toolbox. Our proprietary financing capabilities have allowed us to execute transactions when the traditional markets are more restricted as they are now. And our flexible mandate across corporate carve-outs, public to privates in distressed allows us to pivot to more attractive opportunities.  For example, Fund X began its investment period in October. We've already deployed 1 billion of capital into nine distressed positions through year end, as well as another 2 billion in a take private along other variety of funds, and a sizable chunk of capital to a structured financing.  Moving to retirement services. As Marc mentioned, Athene had a spectacular year of organic inflows totaling 48 billion, including 11 billion in the fourth quarter. The most significant contributor to the fourth quarter was the retail channel, which was 7.5 billion, a new quarterly record. And retail annuities are certainly in high demand industry-wide as principal protected products with attractive guaranteed yield are compelling in today's environment.  Zooming in though, it's clear that Athene success is driven more than just the industry tied expanding distribution, differentiated asset origination and ample capital resources to support that robust growth, which has allowed us to generate record flows while writing business at compelling spreads.  For '23, we expect another robust year of organic growth from Athene across all channels, with gross inflows exceeding 2022 levels and reaching new highs. Retail and flow insurance should remain the strongest but also benefit from a solid pipeline of new distribution relationships in both the U.S. and Asia. And we also expect pension group annuity is likely to remain heightened as the funded status of many corporate pension plans continues to exceed 100%. And while the public FABN market remains less attractive, we're seeing more opportunities in private transactions that require our overall flexibility. Reflecting on the past year, we\u2019ve certainly re-instilled a growth through all assets of our facets of our business and put the building blocks to execute our five-year plan in place. As we said, 2023 will be a pivotal year of execution and optimization. And we're seeing great momentum already.  With that, let me hand it over to Martin.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Marc and Jim have highlighted, 2022 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. Amid a backdrop of significant market choppiness, our financial results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our earnings streams. In our first full year post merger, the combination of our asset management and retirement services businesses proved increasingly valuable. FRE and SRE comprised 93% of total pre-tax earnings in 2022. And on average, we expect 90% or more of our earnings to be driven by stable recurring predictable earnings streams over the long term. This translates to a meaningfully less potential for volatility versus other businesses that may be more reliant on incentive and investment-based income streams.  Our business model is fully aligned with the growth of FRE and SRE inextricably linked and highly correlated. We intend to drive consistent and attractive earnings growth, regardless of the macro backdrop, in line with our stated goal from Investor Day of doubling earnings by 2026. 2022 was a solid proof point of our progress towards this goal, as we met or exceeded nearly all of our key financial and business targets, which we outlined on Page 4 of our earnings release. FRE of $1.4 billion in '22 grew 11% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, while we absorbed costs associated with significant investments in our next chapter of growth. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year, supported by strong fundraising from both our asset management and retirement services clients, as well as a solid pace of capital deployment. As Marc mentioned, capital solutions fees reached a record quarterly $142 million in the fourth quarter, bringing full year revenue to $414 million, up approximately 40% year-over-year, an incredible result amid a turbulent capital markets backdrop, highlighting the quality of our team and the capabilities we've built. Finally, full year FRE margin of 54% was in line with our previously communicated guidance. In retirement services, normalized net spread reached 140 basis points and 123 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year '22, respectively, well above our initial 110 to 115 basis point guidance as the higher interest rate backdrop, more interesting investing climate, and robust organic growth trends drove upside to our expectations.  Athene\u2019s alternative investment portfolio returned 10.4% in 2022, very close to our 11% normalized assumption, driven by a broad-based strength across strategic retirement services platforms, origination platforms and fund investment returns. Entering 2023, we expect another year of strength across the businesses. I'll walk through some of the key building blocks.  As previously communicated, we expect fee-related revenue growth of more than 20% in 2023. The bulk of this growth should be driven by management fees, resulting from a variety of new strategic growth initiatives that Marc and Jim walked through, robust organic inflows from Athene, strong capital deployment in yield and hybrid strategies, and additional capital raised for Fund X. Turning to capital solutions. Fee revenue from this business far exceeded our expectations in 2022, growing approximately twice as fast as we originally expected. Given the strong outperformance, we currently see last year's level providing a good baseline for 2023, which is tracking very nicely versus our $500 million target by 2026. We see a healthy pipeline of transactions to support this revenue.  Moving to expenses. We expect our rate of growth in total fee-related expenses to moderate as we progress through 2023 driving positive operating leverage versus our full year 2022 margin. We added almost 400 Apollo employees to our total headcount in 2022 following several previous years of significant headcount expansion.  We've been very fortunate to attract top talent in the industry across investing, fundraising, product development, capital markets and enterprise solutions. This has helped drive strong 2022 financial results and solid progress as we look forward on our growth initiatives. We expect that the bulk of our senior hiring is now behind us. Relatedly, we've seen a meaningful increase in our non-comp expenses to support this higher run rate level of employees as well as our strategic initiatives, which has materialized principally through growing occupancy and technology costs. Additionally, our travel and entertainment expenses have normalized back to pre-COVID levels.  We're prudently managing discretionary expenses as we enter the new year, which should help drive a lower growth rate year-over-year in 2023. However, you should expect the fourth quarter of 2022 non-comp to be a good jumping off point for 2023. Altogether, we expect FRE growth of 25% in 2023, equating to approximately $1.75 billion or slightly under $3.00 per share. Turning to retirement services, we expect another strong year of growth in spread-related earnings as Athene continues to fire on all cylinders. We generated extraordinary normalized SRE in the fourth quarter, which was driven by another year of record organic inflows, underwritten to spreads above our target returns, as well as historic interest rate tailwinds. These ingredients led to a truly remarkable performance.  To an increasing degree now, as we look forward, we have the flexibility to choose how much we want to grow and how we want to fund that growth. Given the rising rate, wider spread and strong demand environment of last year, we leaned in and added tens of billions of dollars of highly profitable business that we believe will drive predictable and durable spread-related earnings for years to come.  We find Athene\u2019s growth in a highly capital efficient manner, utilizing its fortress balance sheet resources, which includes third party capital via the ADIP equity sidecars that Marc referenced. For every $100 of inflows sourced, we put up approximately $8 of capital.  Last year, Athene contributed approximately 80% of that capital, as ADIP deployed most of its remaining dry powder. And as ADIP2 comes online, we expect greater utilization of third party capital to support incremental growth, likely double 2022's level or approximately 40%, which will make the business even more capital efficient than it already is today.  In addition to increasing capital efficiency, ADIP provides external validation by sophisticated third party investors of Athene\u2019s core business, risk framework, fee structure and strong returns on capital. Importantly, Apollo earns management fees on total gross assets within the Athene complex, including those managed on behalf of the third party investors in ADIP. Because of this mechanism, we are agnostic to the method of funding for Athene\u2019s growth from an asset management perspective, as fee-related earnings benefit dollar-for-dollar in either scenario.  As we have emphasized before, SRE is a highly attractive running stream, and the economics of growing it represent a highly attractive return on group capital as we evaluate the highest and best uses of capital across the complex. The returns on capital are even more attractive with more equity sidecar funding, and that's another reason we intend to utilize it to a greater degree. We expect this effort will result in Athene\u2019s net invested assets growing by a mid-single digit rate in 2023.  As you know, we have benefited from higher rates due to an allocation to floating rate assets and the positive impacts on new money yields. With the forward curve signaling a flatter trajectory, we currently expect our normalized net investment spread to remain in the vicinity of the strong fourth quarter level, which we expect will underpin a normalized net spread of 135 to 140 basis points for the full year 2023.  Combining our current expectations for organic growth, the use of ADIP equity, the investing environment and the interest rate backdrop, we expect normalized SRE growth of approximately 20% in 2023. And when combining FRE and normalized SRE, we expect year-over-year earnings growth of more than 20% in '23.  As it relates to principal investing, we expect continued equity market volatility and relatively muted capital markets activity, at least in the first half of '23. Although it's difficult to predict market trends with any accuracy, based on the visibility we have into our pipeline through the first half of the year, we currently expect PII to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in '23. If markets continue to improve, it's entirely possible we'll move more actively into a monetizing phase in the back half of the year. Now, finally, let me spend a minute on capital. As a reminder, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital to invest over 2022 to '26, including $5 billion to fund the base dividend of $1.60 per share, $5 billion for additional capital returned via opportunistic buybacks and dividend increases and $5 billion for strategic growth investments. In 2022, we spent nearly $1 billion of capital on the base dividend, about $350 million of capital on strategic investments, and over $300 million of capital for opportunistic share repurchases above ongoing stock comp immunization.  Given the line of sight we have into a strong earnings growth year, we intend to raise the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.72 per share, starting with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. We also expect to be a regular buyer of our stock as we believe the intrinsic value remains highly compelling. In conclusion, we ended the year on a very strong note in what was a very difficult market backdrop. We\u2019re refreshed and focused on executing the next leg of our strategic five-year plan with great enthusiasm.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin for any additional questions. The first question today is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thank you. Appreciate all the detail, particularly on retirement services. I have a quickie, little and big picture on retirement services. On Slide 24, you go through 11 billion of inflows attributable to Athene on the gross inflows, but you also have 11 billion gross outflows. It looks like half was a sale and half was actually policy-driven withdrawal. So curious if you could just talk to that, and then what you're assuming on surrenders? And then maybe you could just flush out a little bit more about your comments on just investment grade and the credit portfolio holding up in this backdrop? Thank you. I appreciate it.\nMarc Rowan: Glenn, it\u2019s Marc. I'll take the first piece of it and then Martin will pick up. So surrenders basically continue at normal levels. What you're watching in the fourth quarter is a normal level of surrenders, the maturity of one FABN, which is a scheduled maturity of the FABN. And then during the year, we reinsured just under 5 billion to Catalina. Catalina is our closed block P&C business. We do not believe the closed block P&C market to be that attractive. And so we are in the process of diversifying Catalina\u2019s business from fully closed block P&C to 50% closed block P&C, which is mostly in runoff, but with a long tail, and 50% annuity. It is another source of capital. Think of it like ADIP and it participates side by side with ADIP2 and ADIP1 in these sorts of transactions. But it is modest in its capital base. So maybe it grows to 10 billion or 15 billion over a number of years. But it is really more just a sideshow to what else is going on in the business. In terms of credit, there's just nothing going on in the portfolio. Impairments were like in the 2 to 3 basis points. There's just nothing we see, Glenn, that gives us cause for concern across the portfolio. And again, it gets back to this notion. We speak a lot about the words private credit. And I say -- as you've heard me say, there are two words that are both English words that actually don't mean anything. Private credit can be AA and private credit can be below investment grade. Both have their place in portfolio. On a regulated balance sheet, it is investment grade private credit, excess spread over publicly traded corporates but without excess risk.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Thanks for all the detail as well. Marc, I had a question for you around the origination ecosystem that you guys have build. That continues to be a really powerful engine for the whole organization. So $100 billion annual origination this year, very good run rate while kind of on your way to your goals. My question is over the course of '22, how much of that has been placed with third party clients that pay your management fee, whether it's a separate account nor through a commingled fund? How much is being placed at Athene or Athora? And ultimately, as you look forward, what would you want that mix to look like ideally?\nMarc Rowan: So Alex, I'll size the business and it's not a statistic I have in front of me, but I'll give you a feel and we'll get back to with the detail. So of the 100 billion of origination, as Jim mentioned, 35 billion this year came off platforms and 65 billion came from what I would say more traditional sources of origination, us calling on companies, high-grade alpha, or other methods of origination. The run rate of the platforms, given that we added seven new platforms in '22 plus the addition now of Atlas means that the run rate will be materially above the 35 billion. The vast majority of what\u2019s being originated by the way is investment grade. My gut tells me that about a third of that ends up in the Apollo ecosystem, meaning Athene and Athora. That another chunk of that maybe 20%, 25% goes into SMAs. And somewhere in the balance is going through our capital solutions business as we build the business. Going forward, we will always be expanding into new clients. I think the Athene-Athora share is kind of where it needs to be. As I jokingly said on the call, Athene wants 25% of everything and 100% of nothing; Athora wants 5% to 10% of everything. And the balance, therefore, is available to clients. Our job is to build the third party recurring client business to another 35% or 40%, leaving 15% or 20% as capital markets. Clearly, we view capital solutions as both a moneymaker in the fee business but as important as a client generator. New clients, particularly investment grade clients, who have never come to the alternatives industry, much less Apollo, are for the first time seeing that they can come and pick up to 200, 300, 400 basis points over the comparable publicly traded IG rating. And so for a portion of their portfolio, they're doing it. And while we're having a discussion, and it sounds relatively normal, this is not a product they can buy. And so they're experiencing the product for the first time through capital solutions. And as they get comfortable with the product, we're moving them into sidecars and into recurring sources of revenue. I\u2019m going to turn it to Jim.\nJim Zelter: The only double-click I'd say on that, Alex, and it's really the core of our business, in our securitized products Atlas, in the past, investors only had access to the end results, i.e. the asset would be in a warehouse platform and they'd have access to the securitized product. What we're doing for our retirement services balance sheets and a few others now is offering that interim role where they can have access to that pre-securitized product. And again, that ecosystem, it creates a flywheel. It started several years ago with our high-grade alpha what we did in ADNOC and Hertz and AB InBev, but that's opened an amazing amount of doors for us of folks coming into our ecosystem, giving us sidecars or SMAs and then they come into commingled funds. But we will put a little bit finer pin on that. But it really creates an ecosystem, as Marc said.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have a follow up on the origination discussion. Could you maybe more specifically frame what the annual origination volume of the Atlas team has been running at? And then more broadly, the release seems to suggest this is kind of the first announcement related to the Credit Suisse transactions. Does that mean there are more incremental things that are going to be announced here like this beginning?\nJim Zelter: Yes, so this is a group that historically had originated in excess of 50 billion a year over the last several years. Sometimes it was chunky or sometimes less, but it's a massive platform in excess of 250 underlying financing facilities or partnerships. The reason why you're seeing the release as stated is it's a bit of a staged closing. There needs to be investor consents as well as a variety of some international licenses and regulatory approvals. So the bulk of what we announced in the last 24 hours is the initial closing. You'll see some rolling closes over the next several months. And it will all be done by midyear. But the fact is that the team is engaged. They've been rebranded. They're operating as an appropriate entity. And for us, it's really the first stage. But what's interesting about it is there will be not only assets and facilities we manage on behalf of our retirement services, but as we roll out a variety of commingled or SMA sidecars along, there will be a residual portfolio that we manage on behalf of Credit Suisse over the next several years.\nMarc Rowan: Patrick, it\u2019s Marc. I want to give you a way of thinking about this. And again, we always have to execute before. But what do we see here? This is a business that has not heretofore existed outside of the banking system. And each of the banks who own one of these businesses is competitive with the other banks. We are not a competitor to the banking system. We actually don't want what the banking system wants. We don't want the client. And I'm saying it in a confusing way. But we can\u2019t sell the client equity, advice, M&A, treasury, payments, FX, and derivatives. And the banking system wants to sell all those things. And what they don't want for the most part is the asset. So we are actually an incredible partner to the banking system. But if you're in a competitive bank or a boutique, you historically have not wanted to bring your client to this business, because you're bringing it to a competitor who's interested in the same thing that you are. Our job here is to represent a capital box, which will serve as an investment grade capital box, as Jim suggested. We will build and have a massive warehouse business. The warehouse business is a really good business. The stat I have in my mind is more than 350 billion of origination over the last seven, eight years with de minimis losses. At spreads, we believe single A credit spreads, but at very wide spreads, which then the warehouses are cleaned out through securitization, which is broadly available to a variety of investors. Our job is to scale that, but also to become the financing partner to lots of boutiques who have clients where they're nervous about bringing them to banks who are their full fledged competitors. Also, we're a great partner to existing banking system on hold positions. People who have securitizing businesses where they just don't want the hold, or they don't want the capital, bringing us in to be a side by side with them, they are bringing in someone who is not a competitor for their client. That's our job. And we have a lot of work in front of us. But Jay Kim has built an amazing team, and we're very excited about what can be done here. We expect, as I suggested previously, this will be accretive financially in 2023. But it's up to us to make it in 2023 strategically accretive to our platform.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMarc Rowan: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Just a follow up to Glenn's question on retirement and OTTIs. Your historical loss rate has been very low, 7 basis points annualized. But what was the loss rate in 4Q? And do you have any view on how this should trend this year, especially in light of the prospects for an economic recession?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So Craig, it\u2019s Martin. The loss rate was right on top of that in Q4. As we go through every asset class and go through a pretty rigorous process, we're just not seeing -- we're not seeing any uptick. If you look at the headline, there was some peak-up CECL adjustments, which were just sort of accounting required, but don't reflect actual credit losses. But the actual changes in the reserves, incidence of any stress and actual realized losses coming through, we're just not seeing it across resi loans, commercial loans, asset backs, any other asset class.\nJim Zelter: And if I can just highlight, Craig, I know there's lots of questions about credit cycle and a concern from our perspective, and we're not the economist. We will let Torsten do that. And we're just following our discipline of purchase price matters. The reality is there are certain sectors that are doing very well post COVID. There are certain that are having a bit of a challenge. Hotels, entertainment, lodging, airlines doing very well; hard industrials or the auto sector is having a tough time. Our IG book, a lot of financials have the big banks. Big IG book, CLO book really strong, AA, AAA book. So we really feel like we have a very well thought out strategic asset allocation and how we put it together is showing the robust nature of the portfolio.\nMarc Rowan: I'll just finish it, Craig. You're going to see a tremendous amount of additional activity from Athene this year in communicating its portfolio what's going on? We have a tremendously good story to tell and the team is anxious to tell it, and they're going to be very visible and very transparent in how that gets sold. But I'll just echo where Martin and Jim started. We're just not seeing it in the portfolio. Absolute normalcy in terms of credit and we're getting paid for structure and for illiquidity and for origination. We're not getting paid for credit.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on the normalized SRE spread. If I heard Martin correctly, I think he was suggesting 135 to 140 for '23. Maybe you can correct me or not. But maybe you could just help unpack some of the moving pieces in your guidance. Clearly, the benefit from higher rates, I think 20% of the book is floating, but also think a portion of the liabilities are also floating. We're seeing cost of funds ticking up here in the quarter. So I was just hoping you could elaborate on some of the moving pieces, where are cost of funds on new business? And as you look out three to five years, where do you see that net SRE spread settling out to over time? Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So Mike, that's the reason we provide a single net number to sort of get through the puts and takes that go into that. The benefit of interest rate increases on the floating rate assets is starting to diminish, as you'd expect, right? A lot of that benefit has come through the numbers. And if we just assume that today's rate curve at the short end holds for the year, over the next couple of quarters that will flat line out, right? So that's a temporary benefit for the year. There's also option costs that are required to hedge rate features and policies, which are part of that. And so we're seeing some headwinds there. And we're assuming that fourth quarter was extraordinary in terms of net spreads. We had 145 basis points of fully netted costs, 185 before OpEx and financing costs. And so we don't expect in our models that that will continue. And so if you bring that down to a more normalized level and net all of the above, including what we think is an appropriate allocation to alts for the year, you get to that 135 to 140 basis points. And that's the reason we're trying to anchor around a single metric, which we believe is the most sort of appropriate view of spread for the year, given the components that go into it.\nMarc Rowan: Maybe I'll take the two pieces of it that Martin didn't flush out. One is in alts. One has to be stepping back and saying that if I look at the relative attractiveness of asset classes, a credit is simply more attractive than equity. And so you will see that reflected on the margin allocations from Athene. And all of this nets down into credit requires less capital than equity, which allows us to do more business. The other piece, and it's important that you track this through in the model, is we have a choice. And the choice is keep 100% of the business on the books, realize the growth in SRE and deploy our own capital, as that\u2019s Athene\u2019s balance sheet capital, or allocate a portion of the business to sidecars and essentially receive a fee for fronting that at Athene, receive FRE at Apollo for managing that and allow investors to earn the spread. Given the attractiveness of credit, this for investors is another opportunity for investors to invest in private investment grade credit with perfectly matched low cost liabilities, which is why we've seen such good take up at ADIP2 in addition to the really strong performance of ADIP1. And so as Martin suggested, we expect a very strong origination here, organically. Not even looking at inorganic where the cost of funds is now not sufficiently attractive to justify spending any money. But we will allocate more of that growth to sidecars than we will to the Athene balance sheet. And so it is not just understanding the spread of the business. It's understanding how much of the business we elect to keep. And so the second number I think you need to anchor on is we're expecting SRE growth of about 20% year-over-year. Combination of basis points margin, which in part reflects a decision between debt and equity, and then on the growth side, how much capital we want to deploy as principal versus how much we want to deploy through the sidecars? We're in a fortunate position where we have that choice.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Finian O\u2019Shea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFinian O\u2019Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Another on the Atlas partners origination. Will Athene provide the warehouse financing? And if so, are you offering similar to what banks do on advanced rates or go further? And then relatedly for the equity of those deals, will you mainly sell to something like AAA internal or more so external parties? Thank you.\nJim Zelter: Okay. Let's take a step back for a second. No, Athene is not offering warehouses. We're going out. There's a consortium of global banks that you're very familiar with that are offering us appropriate financing facilities for the commercial real estate, the resi real estate and the consumer facilities, again, global banks, massive facilities. And what Athene will take as other investors, they'll take either the mezzanine or the residual of that financing facility. And again, I contrast this to what we were talking earlier. They're not taking residual securitization risk, which is a higher attachment and lower spread. What Athene and the other investors will have access to is those financing facilities with lower attachment points and higher spreads behind those senior banks. So think spreads 350, 450 over; think attachment points 55% to 65%, where once those companies go to the securitization market, the attachment point goes to 80%, 85% at dramatically tighter spreads. So what we're talking about is offering these investors Athene, Athora and many, many others to get earlier in the process, earlier in the manufacturing of these facilities than ever had they've been able to participate before.\nMarc Rowan: I think it's important to say, we're not in the credit risk business in what we're talking about. There's nothing about the advanced rate that is going to be different than that which that is available commercially everywhere. We want to get paid for structure and direct origination. We are not looking to get paid for credit risk unless we're in a credit fund that is supposed to get paid for credit risk. This is about avoidance. And in terms of the funding of this, the funding of this, there's very little equity funding that is required for the platform upfront. It will be funded by AAA and by third party investors side by side. And this will -- the funding structure itself is all laid out in the 10-K coming up.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to come back to your comments about the capital efficiency at Athene. The sidecars contribution is now stepping up to about 40% of the capital. I guess that's a fair amount of capital being freed up. And I was curious about where you're looking to deploy that capital. And I think the last couple of quarters, you've mentioned buybacks were right at the top of your capital hierarchy. I suppose how are you thinking about all that? Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Good morning. It's Martin. So at the top of the house, we have choices, and the choices are to buy back stock, which we expect to be programmatic about. We think that that's a very attractive use of capital, given the business plan we see in front of us even at current multiples. I think a small portion for increasing the dividend, because we think that's important to be sort of an S&P like company. And then a portion to invest in the business, which frankly I think we see less need to do right now given most of the growth is organic, and the three initiatives and the next six are being built out with people and not being acquired. So that HoldCo capital benefits from a dividend up from Athene each year of $750 million. We expect that that will continue at its current level. And then when you look at the capital efficiency at the Athene level, Athene is growing massively. So growth requires capital. Athene is creating meaningful earnings, 2.3 billion of SRE in the year just finished, up 20% next year. That will be used to fund growth that's not retained by ADIP and to fund the $750 million dividend. But as we look at the choice to spend $1 of capital of Athene with or without the benefit of ADIP, it's clearly more accretive across the group to leverage ADIP. And ADIP validates the structure and has terrific returns for its own investors. And then there's AAA, right, which gets to the platform strategy. So they're the key pockets of capital that we look at, and we're looking to optimize it, realizing that uses of capital for buybacks, dividend increases and investments are all attractive in their own ways. But growth requires capital at Athene. And so we're very focused on making sure that we can manage that appropriately and maintain low leverage and strong capital levels above what's required to ensure that the balance sheet is really robust.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ben Budish of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the inflow outlook for Athene. It sounds like you guys have a lot of confidence that growth is going to continue pretty nicely into next year. I'm just kind of curious, on the retail side, how much of that is coming from new distribution versus sort of ongoing, just underlying strength given where rates are? And on the pension side, just kind of curious, you explained that it's somewhat seasonal. But just curious, what we should think of as kind of a normalized run rate as we go into next year? Thanks.\nMarc Rowan: So we'll get back to on the absolute breakdown between new distribution and strong distribution. But it is clear to me that consumers prefer higher rates versus lower rates. And so you're seeing a tailwind to the industry. Having said that, new distribution, new pockets we opened up in the beginning of last year have been incredibly strong. And I won't steal Athene\u2019s thunder or their announcement, but they expect this year to be at least two massive launches. And so we are still early in our build out phase of expanding distribution, not to mention new suites of products and everything else. So I think there the tailwind is really good across distribution. And based on what we've seen, at least so far, early dates, it appears that '23 is off to a really good start. In terms of PRT, this is not a -- there's a lot of volume to do out there. But the only business worth doing is business that comes at acceptable spreads. And so we have a budget of what we want to do for the year, roughly 10-ish billion, and it's our job to optimize within the deals that are out there and that which provides us the greatest spread in term and the best mix of business. We expect -- and I'll say we expect that we will exceed organically in '23 what Athene did in '22. And we will likely have to make choices and temper our growth. This will not be a question of whether there's business to do. This is going to be a question of how much business we want to do.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Gerry O\u2019Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGerald O\u2019Hara: Great, thanks. Hoping maybe we could get just a little bit of an update on sort of the outlook for global wealth. Appreciate it's still early days, but hoping we could get a sense of how to think about the cadence and flows while balancing I think your comments of not looking to be necessarily the biggest or fastest growing kind of product generation? And then also if you could just maybe give us a sense of what the incremental products are that we might be able to expect as it relates to the sort of nine perpetual products by year and that you called out in prepared remarks? Thank you.\nJim Zelter: Thanks for the question. We'll just dimensionalize it, like taking a step back, Marc talked about what we did last year around 6 billion. We got about 30 billion in the entire platform right now of products within various global wealth channels in terms of our existing products. And as you point out, like of the 9 billion to 10 billion this year, probably two thirds of that, 6.5 billion, 7 billion will be in the perpetual type of product that we've created, which is AAA, Apollo Debt Solutions, which has been out ADS, as well as a variety of non-traded REITs. And we also purchased a couple of products from Griffin, an interval fund in real estate and an interval fund in credit. So we see broad growth across those. And then the residual of the 9 billion this year will be a variety of our institutional products that we put in the appropriate wrapper. But again, our view is you're stepping back is this is a long journey. Certainly the characteristics of those who are going to win, not everybody is going to win. The distribution channels want a handful of producers or providers. We have the track record. We have the brand now. And what\u2019s additional necessary is the technology and the education. So those are how we want to solve the riddle, if you will. But we're not seeing -- the vehicles we have had solid performance. We've not gotten anything that we would think as any kind of redemptions at year end from Windows. So we're happy with the journey we're on and it's, as I said, between the retail perpetual funds from none a couple of years ago to almost nine at year end to the variety of drawdown funds, more than five of those. We feel very comfortable with our product set.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Adam Beatty of UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning. Just a quick follow up on retail wealth. Marc, I think mentioned some of the challenges that product elsewhere faced last year. Just wondering, has that kind of dampened sentiment? How do you view the take up? And also Jim just mentioned your education? How much recognition have you seen so far that some of the Apollo products are just truly distinctive and a better mousetrap? Thank you.\nJim Zelter: Well, certainly, as we've talked about what we're doing on AAA, Apollo Aligned Alternatives, we think, as Marc has been public saying, we think that could be the largest flagship vehicle of our firm over the next several years. Certainly what we're doing with some of the insurance products and what we're doing with the Apollo Altitude, we think those are a bit, I use the term groundbreaking, but we think they're providing incredible value. And they're somewhat unmatched in terms of the attributes. That being said, there's been some noise about some other folks out there having some redemptions. First of all, I think they're doing the right thing by the discipline that they're engaging in, in terms of making sure people don't think that the incremental yield comes without a cost. But that being said, this is a mere hiccup in a long successful transition and journey, and we're happy to be part of that transition. But no doubt, it's not just about you have to have multiple resources to create all those things we talked about. We've launched this Apollo Academy, which is a broad, broad education set available to those channels. And the take up on that has been extraordinary. So it's not only product creation, execution returns, but also technology applications as well as education.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions for today's event. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Gunn for closing comments.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks again, Donna. And thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. I appreciate your continued interest in Apollo. And if you have any follow-up questions on what we discussed on today's call, please feel free to reach out. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Marc and Jim have highlighted, 2022 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. Amid a backdrop of significant market choppiness, our financial results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our earnings streams. In our first full year post merger, the combination of our asset management and retirement services businesses proved increasingly valuable. FRE and SRE comprised 93% of total pre-tax earnings in 2022. And on average, we expect 90% or more of our earnings to be driven by stable recurring predictable earnings streams over the long term. This translates to a meaningfully less potential for volatility versus other businesses that may be more reliant on incentive and investment-based income streams.  Our business model is fully aligned with the growth of FRE and SRE inextricably linked and highly correlated. We intend to drive consistent and attractive earnings growth, regardless of the macro backdrop, in line with our stated goal from Investor Day of doubling earnings by 2026. 2022 was a solid proof point of our progress towards this goal, as we met or exceeded nearly all of our key financial and business targets, which we outlined on Page 4 of our earnings release. FRE of $1.4 billion in '22 grew 11% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, while we absorbed costs associated with significant investments in our next chapter of growth. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year, supported by strong fundraising from both our asset management and retirement services clients, as well as a solid pace of capital deployment. As Marc mentioned, capital solutions fees reached a record quarterly $142 million in the fourth quarter, bringing full year revenue to $414 million, up approximately 40% year-over-year, an incredible result amid a turbulent capital markets backdrop, highlighting the quality of our team and the capabilities we've built. Finally, full year FRE margin of 54% was in line with our previously communicated guidance. In retirement services, normalized net spread reached 140 basis points and 123 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year '22, respectively, well above our initial 110 to 115 basis point guidance as the higher interest rate backdrop, more interesting investing climate, and robust organic growth trends drove upside to our expectations.  Athene\u2019s alternative investment portfolio returned 10.4% in 2022, very close to our 11% normalized assumption, driven by a broad-based strength across strategic retirement services platforms, origination platforms and fund investment returns. Entering 2023, we expect another year of strength across the businesses. I'll walk through some of the key building blocks.  As previously communicated, we expect fee-related revenue growth of more than 20% in 2023. The bulk of this growth should be driven by management fees, resulting from a variety of new strategic growth initiatives that Marc and Jim walked through, robust organic inflows from Athene, strong capital deployment in yield and hybrid strategies, and additional capital raised for Fund X. Turning to capital solutions. Fee revenue from this business far exceeded our expectations in 2022, growing approximately twice as fast as we originally expected. Given the strong outperformance, we currently see last year's level providing a good baseline for 2023, which is tracking very nicely versus our $500 million target by 2026. We see a healthy pipeline of transactions to support this revenue.  Moving to expenses. We expect our rate of growth in total fee-related expenses to moderate as we progress through 2023 driving positive operating leverage versus our full year 2022 margin. We added almost 400 Apollo employees to our total headcount in 2022 following several previous years of significant headcount expansion.  We've been very fortunate to attract top talent in the industry across investing, fundraising, product development, capital markets and enterprise solutions. This has helped drive strong 2022 financial results and solid progress as we look forward on our growth initiatives. We expect that the bulk of our senior hiring is now behind us. Relatedly, we've seen a meaningful increase in our non-comp expenses to support this higher run rate level of employees as well as our strategic initiatives, which has materialized principally through growing occupancy and technology costs. Additionally, our travel and entertainment expenses have normalized back to pre-COVID levels.  We're prudently managing discretionary expenses as we enter the new year, which should help drive a lower growth rate year-over-year in 2023. However, you should expect the fourth quarter of 2022 non-comp to be a good jumping off point for 2023. Altogether, we expect FRE growth of 25% in 2023, equating to approximately $1.75 billion or slightly under $3.00 per share. Turning to retirement services, we expect another strong year of growth in spread-related earnings as Athene continues to fire on all cylinders. We generated extraordinary normalized SRE in the fourth quarter, which was driven by another year of record organic inflows, underwritten to spreads above our target returns, as well as historic interest rate tailwinds. These ingredients led to a truly remarkable performance.  To an increasing degree now, as we look forward, we have the flexibility to choose how much we want to grow and how we want to fund that growth. Given the rising rate, wider spread and strong demand environment of last year, we leaned in and added tens of billions of dollars of highly profitable business that we believe will drive predictable and durable spread-related earnings for years to come.  We find Athene\u2019s growth in a highly capital efficient manner, utilizing its fortress balance sheet resources, which includes third party capital via the ADIP equity sidecars that Marc referenced. For every $100 of inflows sourced, we put up approximately $8 of capital.  Last year, Athene contributed approximately 80% of that capital, as ADIP deployed most of its remaining dry powder. And as ADIP2 comes online, we expect greater utilization of third party capital to support incremental growth, likely double 2022's level or approximately 40%, which will make the business even more capital efficient than it already is today.  In addition to increasing capital efficiency, ADIP provides external validation by sophisticated third party investors of Athene\u2019s core business, risk framework, fee structure and strong returns on capital. Importantly, Apollo earns management fees on total gross assets within the Athene complex, including those managed on behalf of the third party investors in ADIP. Because of this mechanism, we are agnostic to the method of funding for Athene\u2019s growth from an asset management perspective, as fee-related earnings benefit dollar-for-dollar in either scenario.  As we have emphasized before, SRE is a highly attractive running stream, and the economics of growing it represent a highly attractive return on group capital as we evaluate the highest and best uses of capital across the complex. The returns on capital are even more attractive with more equity sidecar funding, and that's another reason we intend to utilize it to a greater degree. We expect this effort will result in Athene\u2019s net invested assets growing by a mid-single digit rate in 2023.  As you know, we have benefited from higher rates due to an allocation to floating rate assets and the positive impacts on new money yields. With the forward curve signaling a flatter trajectory, we currently expect our normalized net investment spread to remain in the vicinity of the strong fourth quarter level, which we expect will underpin a normalized net spread of 135 to 140 basis points for the full year 2023.  Combining our current expectations for organic growth, the use of ADIP equity, the investing environment and the interest rate backdrop, we expect normalized SRE growth of approximately 20% in 2023. And when combining FRE and normalized SRE, we expect year-over-year earnings growth of more than 20% in '23.  As it relates to principal investing, we expect continued equity market volatility and relatively muted capital markets activity, at least in the first half of '23. Although it's difficult to predict market trends with any accuracy, based on the visibility we have into our pipeline through the first half of the year, we currently expect PII to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in '23. If markets continue to improve, it's entirely possible we'll move more actively into a monetizing phase in the back half of the year. Now, finally, let me spend a minute on capital. As a reminder, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital to invest over 2022 to '26, including $5 billion to fund the base dividend of $1.60 per share, $5 billion for additional capital returned via opportunistic buybacks and dividend increases and $5 billion for strategic growth investments. In 2022, we spent nearly $1 billion of capital on the base dividend, about $350 million of capital on strategic investments, and over $300 million of capital for opportunistic share repurchases above ongoing stock comp immunization.  Given the line of sight we have into a strong earnings growth year, we intend to raise the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.72 per share, starting with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. We also expect to be a regular buyer of our stock as we believe the intrinsic value remains highly compelling. In conclusion, we ended the year on a very strong note in what was a very difficult market backdrop. We\u2019re refreshed and focused on executing the next leg of our strategic five-year plan with great enthusiasm.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Yes. So Craig, it\u2019s Martin. The loss rate was right on top of that in Q4. As we go through every asset class and go through a pretty rigorous process, we're just not seeing -- we're not seeing any uptick. If you look at the headline, there was some peak-up CECL adjustments, which were just sort of accounting required, but don't reflect actual credit losses. But the actual changes in the reserves, incidence of any stress and actual realized losses coming through, we're just not seeing it across resi loans, commercial loans, asset backs, any other asset class. Yes. So Mike, that's the reason we provide a single net number to sort of get through the puts and takes that go into that. The benefit of interest rate increases on the floating rate assets is starting to diminish, as you'd expect, right? A lot of that benefit has come through the numbers. And if we just assume that today's rate curve at the short end holds for the year, over the next couple of quarters that will flat line out, right? So that's a temporary benefit for the year. There's also option costs that are required to hedge rate features and policies, which are part of that. And so we're seeing some headwinds there. And we're assuming that fourth quarter was extraordinary in terms of net spreads. We had 145 basis points of fully netted costs, 185 before OpEx and financing costs. And so we don't expect in our models that that will continue. And so if you bring that down to a more normalized level and net all of the above, including what we think is an appropriate allocation to alts for the year, you get to that 135 to 140 basis points. And that's the reason we're trying to anchor around a single metric, which we believe is the most sort of appropriate view of spread for the year, given the components that go into it. Good morning. It's Martin. So at the top of the house, we have choices, and the choices are to buy back stock, which we expect to be programmatic about. We think that that's a very attractive use of capital, given the business plan we see in front of us even at current multiples. I think a small portion for increasing the dividend, because we think that's important to be sort of an S&P like company. And then a portion to invest in the business, which frankly I think we see less need to do right now given most of the growth is organic, and the three initiatives and the next six are being built out with people and not being acquired. So that HoldCo capital benefits from a dividend up from Athene each year of $750 million. We expect that that will continue at its current level. And then when you look at the capital efficiency at the Athene level, Athene is growing massively. So growth requires capital. Athene is creating meaningful earnings, 2.3 billion of SRE in the year just finished, up 20% next year. That will be used to fund growth that's not retained by ADIP and to fund the $750 million dividend. But as we look at the choice to spend $1 of capital of Athene with or without the benefit of ADIP, it's clearly more accretive across the group to leverage ADIP. And ADIP validates the structure and has terrific returns for its own investors. And then there's AAA, right, which gets to the platform strategy. So they're the key pockets of capital that we look at, and we're looking to optimize it, realizing that uses of capital for buybacks, dividend increases and investments are all attractive in their own ways. But growth requires capital at Athene. And so we're very focused on making sure that we can manage that appropriately and maintain low leverage and strong capital levels above what's required to ensure that the balance sheet is really robust."

            "name": "Jim Zelter",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. As you've heard us say before, one of our core tenants is excess return per unit of risk. After 12-plus years of low rates and relatively free money, the best investors will begin to reveal themselves. And strong investment performance is the foundation of our business and we take our responsibility to provide differentiating returns to our clients quite seriously.  As we look out to 2023, we believe this is a particularly good time for Apollo to generate excess return. While other managers may be in a defensive position, we have been patiently waiting for this type of environment and we're confident there will be meaningful opportunities to deploy capital amid a heightened period of volatility and candidly a foggy capital markets backdrop.  Marc provided a high level update on our three key growth pillars, and I'd like to deep dive for a moment into origination. As we addressed at that Investor Day a short 16 months ago, a large portion of what we do is this high grade, fixed income replacement end of the market. Central to our strategy is the ability to originate a recurring supply of these durable assets. And one of the primary ways we do though is through these platforms, real operating businesses within a variety of industries.  Platform origination is clearly a differentiated way to originate these investment grades assets at scale, which is needed to grow our retirement services business profitably and increasingly to third party accounts that want the same alpha in their portfolio. Importantly, however, rather than expand HoldCo balance sheet resources, the capital used to purchase these origination platforms can be sourced via the normal course purchasing power of Athene\u2019s alt portfolio as well as AAA. At year end, our platform ecosystem was producing approximately 35 billion of annual volume and generating about 425 basis points of excess spread versus equivalent IG benchmarks. We've assembled this portfolio of 16 platforms across asset classes in sectors which had been acquired through a variety of funds we manage and also built organically, and we're now focused on scale and execution of those.  Metaphorically speaking, we pay the tuition to develop this important capability of scale, which we think is a great competitive advantage or MO [ph]. This advantage will expand following this week's or yesterday's announcement of the CS securitized products group platform, which has been renamed Atlas SP. This platform is a best-in-class asset-backed warehousing business, really a finance company of finance companies, with an extensive network of clients, an amazing 20-year track record of negligible losses.  The industry-leading team at Atlas is excited to be working with Apollo. And through the closing process, it's become clear that the variety of counterparties also want to work with the Apollo ecosystem. Many investors are reaching out to us as they expand their private credit exposure from direct lending into a broad base of asset-based finance capabilities. We think this is the largely untapped part of the 40 trillion IG fixed income replacement market. And simply put, we believe the opportunity to source resilient yield in asset-based finance is where sponsor finance was and private credit was 10 years ago.  In addition to the three growth pillars, we began to execute on six additional strategic initiatives that we've mentioned past. We've organized our efforts and resources around these initiatives, and now '23 is focused on execution. In this competitive fundraising landscape, our innovative and differentiated product offerings we believe will stand out. And we're seeing early indications of those facts.  And I'll mention a few here. We continue to be very optimistic on the growth of AAA or Apollo Aligned Alternatives. We're broadening the distribution system domestically through additional bank platform and a variety of other independent channels as well as globally to Asia and Europe. To note, we're launching our European product platform in the coming months, designed to offer a full suite of options to individuals in Europe, and AAA will be the first product available on that platform.  We've also begun marketing Athene Altitude [ph]. This is a product designed to offer a range of Apollo managed funds across this risk-reward spectrum, but to do so in a tax efficient vehicle. While still early, we raised 300 million in the fourth quarter from our first client, a third party insurance firm, to invest in AAA through Athene Altitude. Additionally, a couple of key organic initiatives in nascent asset classes are building scale.  Our sponsor and secondary solutions platform, named S3, has gained momentum following a cornerstone investment from [indiscernible] last year. This overall business has committed or deployed over 13 billion of capital since 2020, mainly in fund finance but has been committed over 1 billion into equity and credit secondaries over the past six months. And we expect formally to launch fundraising for an equity secondaries fund in the second quarter and opportunistically raise capital for our credit secondaries fund ahead of a dedicated fundraise in 2024.  We're seeing a similar story in our clean transition franchise. Since launching our sustainable investing platform about a year ago, we've committed or deployed over 6 billion of capital into these investments. And later this month, we will be adding a dedicated team for climate and infrastructure yield to further boost our origination capabilities across the board. And we anticipate launching fundraising for clean transition finance and opportunistic vehicles in the latter half of this year.  Next, we're bringing in the investment toolkit that has made Athene and Athora successful to others in the retirement services industry. Our proprietary origination volume has grown, as Marc said, in consistency and diversity. And now we're reaching a point where we can distribute more of these assets to third parties who have the same fundamental needs. We are building on a strong foundation of existing relationships in that area.  And over the next year, we aim to raise over $10 billion of capital from others in the retirement services space. And finally, we're replicating the successful sidecar structure we've had with MidCap and ADIP in a variety of other areas in our business and to do so in a simplified, cost effective manner to really scale and partner with the investors, as Marc mentioned, in the Apollo ecosystem.  Turning to our broader fundraising activities apart from these new six initiatives, our momentum on a variety of fronts is strong. In asset management, we had strong inflows and included 46 billion of third party fundraising, which doubled 2021 levels. In the fourth quarter specifically, total fundraising of 9 billion was driven by new capital for Athora income and incremental capital for a variety of drawdown fundraisers, co-investment capital, and in our global wealth, including 800 million for AAA.  Looking to '23, we expect a record amount of capital from third party investors exceeding the strong levels achieved last year. And we're already in the market with a range of drawdown funds, including our fourth vintage European principal finance, our third infrastructure fund, as Marc mentioned, ADIP2 and certainly our 10th vintage of our flagship private equity fund. Additionally, a variety of funds and manager accounts across the yield strategies that are currently raising capital, or will be later in the year similar to our Accord series as well as a variety of perpetual products, as Marc mentioned, in the global wealth channel, including the non-traded BDC, non-traded REIT and two interval funds.  Regarding Fund X fundraising, I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing broad support from the existing shareholder investor base and gaining traction with new investors, especially from non-U.S. regions and the global wealth channel. Through January, we've received commitments approximately 15 billion. And with congestion dynamics in the market, it's difficult to predict the ultimate size of the fund and exact timing. However, we expect to close on the majority of incremental commitments in the back half of the second quarter, and we believe the fund will land within striking distance of our target.  Coming into the new year, we believe investors are focusing on managers with healthy portfolios who had less exposure to growth-oriented sectors, which certainly bodes well for our long tenured strategy. It's worth noting that our private equity fund portfolios outperformed the S&P by over 25% in 2022 and our flagship PE Fund IX appreciated 22% during the year. Revenue and EBITDA trends remain strong in those portfolios, up mid-teens percent year-over-year across the broader fund portfolios.  Historically, and as you've heard, we've generated some of our best returns for investors and midmarket downturns and we're one of the few funds with a complete product toolbox. Our proprietary financing capabilities have allowed us to execute transactions when the traditional markets are more restricted as they are now. And our flexible mandate across corporate carve-outs, public to privates in distressed allows us to pivot to more attractive opportunities.  For example, Fund X began its investment period in October. We've already deployed 1 billion of capital into nine distressed positions through year end, as well as another 2 billion in a take private along other variety of funds, and a sizable chunk of capital to a structured financing.  Moving to retirement services. As Marc mentioned, Athene had a spectacular year of organic inflows totaling 48 billion, including 11 billion in the fourth quarter. The most significant contributor to the fourth quarter was the retail channel, which was 7.5 billion, a new quarterly record. And retail annuities are certainly in high demand industry-wide as principal protected products with attractive guaranteed yield are compelling in today's environment.  Zooming in though, it's clear that Athene success is driven more than just the industry tied expanding distribution, differentiated asset origination and ample capital resources to support that robust growth, which has allowed us to generate record flows while writing business at compelling spreads.  For '23, we expect another robust year of organic growth from Athene across all channels, with gross inflows exceeding 2022 levels and reaching new highs. Retail and flow insurance should remain the strongest but also benefit from a solid pipeline of new distribution relationships in both the U.S. and Asia. And we also expect pension group annuity is likely to remain heightened as the funded status of many corporate pension plans continues to exceed 100%. And while the public FABN market remains less attractive, we're seeing more opportunities in private transactions that require our overall flexibility. Reflecting on the past year, we\u2019ve certainly re-instilled a growth through all assets of our facets of our business and put the building blocks to execute our five-year plan in place. As we said, 2023 will be a pivotal year of execution and optimization. And we're seeing great momentum already.  With that, let me hand it over to Martin. The only double-click I'd say on that, Alex, and it's really the core of our business, in our securitized products Atlas, in the past, investors only had access to the end results, i.e. the asset would be in a warehouse platform and they'd have access to the securitized product. What we're doing for our retirement services balance sheets and a few others now is offering that interim role where they can have access to that pre-securitized product. And again, that ecosystem, it creates a flywheel. It started several years ago with our high-grade alpha what we did in ADNOC and Hertz and AB InBev, but that's opened an amazing amount of doors for us of folks coming into our ecosystem, giving us sidecars or SMAs and then they come into commingled funds. But we will put a little bit finer pin on that. But it really creates an ecosystem, as Marc said. Yes, so this is a group that historically had originated in excess of 50 billion a year over the last several years. Sometimes it was chunky or sometimes less, but it's a massive platform in excess of 250 underlying financing facilities or partnerships. The reason why you're seeing the release as stated is it's a bit of a staged closing. There needs to be investor consents as well as a variety of some international licenses and regulatory approvals. So the bulk of what we announced in the last 24 hours is the initial closing. You'll see some rolling closes over the next several months. And it will all be done by midyear. But the fact is that the team is engaged. They've been rebranded. They're operating as an appropriate entity. And for us, it's really the first stage. But what's interesting about it is there will be not only assets and facilities we manage on behalf of our retirement services, but as we roll out a variety of commingled or SMA sidecars along, there will be a residual portfolio that we manage on behalf of Credit Suisse over the next several years. And if I can just highlight, Craig, I know there's lots of questions about credit cycle and a concern from our perspective, and we're not the economist. We will let Torsten do that. And we're just following our discipline of purchase price matters. The reality is there are certain sectors that are doing very well post COVID. There are certain that are having a bit of a challenge. Hotels, entertainment, lodging, airlines doing very well; hard industrials or the auto sector is having a tough time. Our IG book, a lot of financials have the big banks. Big IG book, CLO book really strong, AA, AAA book. So we really feel like we have a very well thought out strategic asset allocation and how we put it together is showing the robust nature of the portfolio. Okay. Let's take a step back for a second. No, Athene is not offering warehouses. We're going out. There's a consortium of global banks that you're very familiar with that are offering us appropriate financing facilities for the commercial real estate, the resi real estate and the consumer facilities, again, global banks, massive facilities. And what Athene will take as other investors, they'll take either the mezzanine or the residual of that financing facility. And again, I contrast this to what we were talking earlier. They're not taking residual securitization risk, which is a higher attachment and lower spread. What Athene and the other investors will have access to is those financing facilities with lower attachment points and higher spreads behind those senior banks. So think spreads 350, 450 over; think attachment points 55% to 65%, where once those companies go to the securitization market, the attachment point goes to 80%, 85% at dramatically tighter spreads. So what we're talking about is offering these investors Athene, Athora and many, many others to get earlier in the process, earlier in the manufacturing of these facilities than ever had they've been able to participate before. Thanks for the question. We'll just dimensionalize it, like taking a step back, Marc talked about what we did last year around 6 billion. We got about 30 billion in the entire platform right now of products within various global wealth channels in terms of our existing products. And as you point out, like of the 9 billion to 10 billion this year, probably two thirds of that, 6.5 billion, 7 billion will be in the perpetual type of product that we've created, which is AAA, Apollo Debt Solutions, which has been out ADS, as well as a variety of non-traded REITs. And we also purchased a couple of products from Griffin, an interval fund in real estate and an interval fund in credit. So we see broad growth across those. And then the residual of the 9 billion this year will be a variety of our institutional products that we put in the appropriate wrapper. But again, our view is you're stepping back is this is a long journey. Certainly the characteristics of those who are going to win, not everybody is going to win. The distribution channels want a handful of producers or providers. We have the track record. We have the brand now. And what\u2019s additional necessary is the technology and the education. So those are how we want to solve the riddle, if you will. But we're not seeing -- the vehicles we have had solid performance. We've not gotten anything that we would think as any kind of redemptions at year end from Windows. So we're happy with the journey we're on and it's, as I said, between the retail perpetual funds from none a couple of years ago to almost nine at year end to the variety of drawdown funds, more than five of those. We feel very comfortable with our product set. Well, certainly, as we've talked about what we're doing on AAA, Apollo Aligned Alternatives, we think, as Marc has been public saying, we think that could be the largest flagship vehicle of our firm over the next several years. Certainly what we're doing with some of the insurance products and what we're doing with the Apollo Altitude, we think those are a bit, I use the term groundbreaking, but we think they're providing incredible value. And they're somewhat unmatched in terms of the attributes. That being said, there's been some noise about some other folks out there having some redemptions. First of all, I think they're doing the right thing by the discipline that they're engaging in, in terms of making sure people don't think that the incremental yield comes without a cost. But that being said, this is a mere hiccup in a long successful transition and journey, and we're happy to be part of that transition. But no doubt, it's not just about you have to have multiple resources to create all those things we talked about. We've launched this Apollo Academy, which is a broad, broad education set available to those channels. And the take up on that has been extraordinary. So it's not only product creation, execution returns, but also technology applications as well as education."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah, and good morning to all. 2022 was a transformational year for the firm. At the end of 2021, we held our first Investor Day and we set out our five-year targets and laid out what we needed to accomplish internally to achieve those targets. End of 2021 seems like a lifetime ago or at least a Fed regime or two ago. However, in 2022, we met or exceeded those targets. Record FRE of 1.4 billion was in line with our target and record normalized SRE of 2.3 billion was meaningfully ahead of target. As important and as we suggested, we restarted the growth engine. Inflows in 2021 were 75 billion. Inflows this year, 128 billion. Inflows for '23 will be higher. We expect a record year of capital raising in 2023. As I've often cautioned, capital raising is the reward for good performance. It is not actually the goal that we set out.  AUM ended the year at 548 billion, or X rates, and FX would have been about 565 billion, all in meaningful progress against our five-year targets. Recall that in Investor Day, we laid out three key objectives or three key pillars that we had to focus on to achieve our plan; global wealth, origination and capital solutions.  Global wealth had a really strong 2022. We ended the year with approximately 30 billion of AUM in our global wealth segment, including 6 billion of capital raised in 2022, accounting for and implementing successfully the Griffin acquisition during the mid part of the year. We are on track to meet or exceed our $50 billion target at the end of 2026. When we laid out these targets, we had zero perpetual products in the marketplace. By year end, we expect nine perpetual products in the marketplace. In short, we've had tremendous receptivity to our product and to our franchise in the global wealth community.  Our goal here, like the goal elsewhere in our organization, is not to be the biggest. We will not necessarily be the fastest growing. We will be seen and are seen as the innovator in this marketplace, showing the global wealth community the kinds of products that they have never seen before and addressing the unique needs of this interesting constituency.  Origination volume totaled north of 100 billion on a 12-month basis. We now have 15 platforms, including seven platforms, which were new additions during 2022. You will hear later in the call the most recent edition, Atlas, formerly known as the Credit Suisse securitized products group. We are definitely on track here to meet or exceed our $150 billion annual target at the end of 2026.  Having a steady source of unique credit production every year really enables us to power our business to make the kind of projections and predictability and the client commitments that are necessary for us to grow. This is good for our FRE business, in that it powers our third parties, particularly in private credit and it is especially good for our SRE business, in that we produce reliable amounts of excess spread, particularly in investment grade private credit.  I'm going to spend a second just on that term. We hear the term private credit a lot. We actually have no idea what the words private credit mean. They're just two words that will follow each other. What we have focused on in our platform and what we have done uniquely is to create a source of private investment grade credit. Very few people, very few organizations have that capability. This is in addition to the strength that the franchise has always had in more generic private credit. Jim will spend a lot of time on this in his remarks and it is a very important part of our franchise going forward and a huge differentiator.  The third pillar that we set out was our capital solutions business. Capital solutions in 2021 was approximately 250 million of annual revenue. And we suggested that at the end of 2026, we wanted that to be north of 500 million of annual revenue. In 2022, we exceeded 400 million of annual revenue. It gives me great confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed the five-year projections that we laid out at the beginning of 2021.  The team has been fully built out globally. We have a massive pipeline that we executed on partially in 2022, and will carry over into the first quarter of 2023, which Martin will touch on. And most important is to help understand and help explain the ecosystem that we are creating. 15 platforms, 15 companies whose only job is to produce credit wake up every day and do what they do, they produce credit.  We, as a diversified buyer of credit for our own balance sheet in SRE we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. And so what that means, we are creating every day credit that needs to be syndicated into the marketplace. Some of that goes into funds or to SMAs of clients who have previously come to the Apollo platform. The rest of it goes into our capital solutions business. This is a strategic imperative for us, and does two very interesting things.  One, as we place credit with third parties, we earn fees. Earning fees is a fundamental part of our business model. But as important, they are expanding our ecosystem. We have done business in the alternative community with investors with circa 3,500 counterparties for a long period of time. This is an opportunity with unique product with side-by-side with align product, with recurring product for our capital solutions group to go out and build new relationships. Sometimes those new relationships will result in one-off transactions, which is just fine. But oftentimes those new relationships will open up client's eyes as to what we can do, and we will turn those into SMAs and recurring revenues. This is an ecosystem that is picking up tremendous traction and the team here is doing an unbelievable job.  As excited as I am about the '22 performance against the three initiatives, I now want to turn to Athene who had just an awesome year. Inflows at Athene on an organic basis were some 48 billion. Athene was the number one purveyor of annuities in the United States, despite not being represented in a lot of annuity markets.  New business was put on the books in the fourth quarter at about 145 basis points of spread versus about 120 basis points of spread for the full year. Both of those targets are meaningfully ahead of what we would consider normal levels of business. 2023 I believe will also continue to be very strong. I doubt it will continue at the same levels that we saw in the fourth quarter. But new business is being put on the books very profitably.  Athene\u2019s alt portfolio, which as many of you also understand forms the foundation for AAA, our retail product, our equity replacement product was up 10% during the year versus the S&P benchmark, which was down almost 20%, very strong performance and an indication that Athene and AAA are doing something other than buying and providing clients with market beta. As we step back and we think about our positioning in this marketplace, one of the questions we ask the team who is the fortress balance sheet in our industry? And the answer is we are the fortress balance sheet in our industry. We are A plus across all three agencies. We ended the year 2 billion of excess capital and more than 1 billion ahead of S&P AA.  Some years ago we introduced was the first sizable reinsurance sidecar for our industry, affectionately known as ADIP1, with 3.25 billion of capital. That sidecar has now been nearly fully deployed. And yesterday or earlier this morning, we announced the first closing for ADIP2 of some $2 billion and we expect that ADIP2 will be larger than ADIP1. And further that ADIP2 will take an increased share of the new business that Athene puts on the books.  This is good all around. This is good for Athene from a capital generation point of view and a capital efficiency point of view, even though it will mean that some of their assets are now essentially belong to investors and they will realize the benefits of SRE growth. It is good for FRE and it is good for our origination franchises creating additional capacity that needs to be filled which will further spur the flywheel of our capital solutions and other businesses. In short, an amazing year for Athene.  Our success in this business of retirement solutions has not gone unnoticed. By some measure, there are now north of 100 asset management entities or insurance entities who have become asset managers pursuing a strategy similar to that which Athene started on 13 years ago. To be successful in this business and to understand where we sit relative to the rest of the business, I believe there are four things that contribute to success.  First is capital. Massive amounts of capital in an industry that has not been able to raise capital. The second is an ability everyday to create investment grade spread. This is something in a skill set that is not traditionally resonant within the alternatives industry, or quite frankly within traditional asset management. It is a skill that we have built up. The third is a really attractive cost structure. You need scale, because ultimately spread is a function of your net interest margin, but it's also a function of a very efficient cost base.  And finally, you need a very attractive cost of funds. If your cost of funds is low, because you're efficient and because your products are well designed, you do not need to take investment risk to earn good returns. And if you're a good investor, returns can actually be quite high. Everything goes in reverse if your cost of funds is very high.  What we are watching in our industry is the haves, like Athene, where we have some 48 billion of organic origination versus the have-nots, the market entrants, who in fact are paying up for inorganic blocks at very high cost of funds, which also are very expensive to administer on a hope that they will get to scale. I believe that the vast majority of new entrants, although not all, will not be successful and will learn a very expensive lesson along the way.  We are also in a period of time where the increased activity by asset managers has resulted in increased regulatory interest in what we are doing. We have spent 13 years creating the kinds of regulatory dialogues and transparency and putting out a best-in-class set of standards. We are, to my knowledge, not just a fortress balance sheet, but the most transparent of the companies.  We regularly publish stress tests, although we are not required. We regularly publish details of assets that we are not required. We regularly go back and forth with respect to our reinsurance so that people understand there is no \u201carbitrage\u201d between the U.S. regulatory standard and the Bermuda regulatory standard. All of the things I've just mentioned are not generally followed by many, although some are good actors of the new entrants.  What you will see in 2023 on our part is an increased foot forward to help lead this regulatory dialogue to make sure that we get to the right place with appropriate transparency and appropriate oversight. This is an amazing business that is driven by powerful trends, but it is also a business of promises to retirees. We expect that we will be included among a group of companies as internationally active insurance groups at some point in 2023, giving us an opportunity and a seat at the table to participate in shaping the regulatory future for our industry, which is changing very fast.  FRE for us is the flipside of FRE. The ability to generate safe yield is something that very few people have. Who need safe yield? Retirees need safe yield, pension funds, replacing a portion of their fixed income need safe yield, banks need safe yield, Japanese insurance companies and international investors need safe yield. The world is short safe yield. And we are very good at producing it. So when we produce it in an asset that is short, we want to maximize the profitability of our capability.  And then why I say that SRE is the flipside of that. We are FRE for the safe field we produce for third parties and for Athene. But then on top of that, we are an SRE or spread-related earnings by matching the safe yield with long-term sticky liabilities. In 2022, a number of other forms of so called permanent capital went in reverse. 2022 was an awesome year for Athene.  Let me step back and now return to a higher level view of our business. Our business, as I've suggested previously, exists and our industry exists to provide investors excess return per unit of risk. It does not exist for us to grow or for us to pursue that which we want. We are fundamentally responding to investor needs. Fortunately, we have very strong tailwinds as a firm and as an industry for the need for income, excess return per unit of risk.  Our business strategy is being driven and growth is being driven in areas where we believe we can continue to produce excess return per unit of risk. Our business is guided not just by excess return by unit of risk, but by an aligned investing philosophy. The combination of Athene and Athora in our balance sheet side by side with investors ensures investors at all points in time that we are fully aligned with them.  Finally, as I'm sure Jim will pivot on to, purchase price matters. The purchase price matters strategy is very hard to pursue in a risk-on everything rally [ph]. Nonetheless, we did that and the reward for doing that was certainly available and shown in 2022. But I believe the positioning we've taken out and our industry tailwinds really bode well for us going forward. 2023 will be a very good year for Apollo. We are on offense. We have 50 billion of dry powder across the platform. We deployed 160 billion in 2022. Fundamentally, we do better when markets are uncertain and when there is uncertainty in the economy. We expect FRE and SRE in 2023 to be up more than 20% over 2022, as I'm sure Martin will detail in his remarks.  But we also have an amazing opportunity in our business to really focus on operating leverage. We have enough in front of us with the initiatives that are currently on our plate to not just meet our 2023 goals but to meet our five-year targets. Alongside the three pillars of global wealth, origination and capital solutions, we have added a number of growth initiatives and I will not steal Jim Zelter's thunder as he lays out the things that are in front of us to focus on.  Suffice it to say, 2023 will be a year of execution. We will return the business to operating leverage in 2023 and again in 2024. The team here feels great. There's tremendous momentum. We are incredibly engaged and energized. And at the end of the day, what makes this a great place is the people.  This is a group of hardworking charitable people where the vast majority of the team, 93% are involved in our giving programs. And our job is to be the single best place to be a partner in the financial services industry. And with that, I want to thank the employees for an amazing year and the investors and analysts for all the time you've given us to understand what we're trying to do.  And with that, let me turn it over to Jim. Glenn, it\u2019s Marc. I'll take the first piece of it and then Martin will pick up. So surrenders basically continue at normal levels. What you're watching in the fourth quarter is a normal level of surrenders, the maturity of one FABN, which is a scheduled maturity of the FABN. And then during the year, we reinsured just under 5 billion to Catalina. Catalina is our closed block P&C business. We do not believe the closed block P&C market to be that attractive. And so we are in the process of diversifying Catalina\u2019s business from fully closed block P&C to 50% closed block P&C, which is mostly in runoff, but with a long tail, and 50% annuity. It is another source of capital. Think of it like ADIP and it participates side by side with ADIP2 and ADIP1 in these sorts of transactions. But it is modest in its capital base. So maybe it grows to 10 billion or 15 billion over a number of years. But it is really more just a sideshow to what else is going on in the business. In terms of credit, there's just nothing going on in the portfolio. Impairments were like in the 2 to 3 basis points. There's just nothing we see, Glenn, that gives us cause for concern across the portfolio. And again, it gets back to this notion. We speak a lot about the words private credit. And I say -- as you've heard me say, there are two words that are both English words that actually don't mean anything. Private credit can be AA and private credit can be below investment grade. Both have their place in portfolio. On a regulated balance sheet, it is investment grade private credit, excess spread over publicly traded corporates but without excess risk. So Alex, I'll size the business and it's not a statistic I have in front of me, but I'll give you a feel and we'll get back to with the detail. So of the 100 billion of origination, as Jim mentioned, 35 billion this year came off platforms and 65 billion came from what I would say more traditional sources of origination, us calling on companies, high-grade alpha, or other methods of origination. The run rate of the platforms, given that we added seven new platforms in '22 plus the addition now of Atlas means that the run rate will be materially above the 35 billion. The vast majority of what\u2019s being originated by the way is investment grade. My gut tells me that about a third of that ends up in the Apollo ecosystem, meaning Athene and Athora. That another chunk of that maybe 20%, 25% goes into SMAs. And somewhere in the balance is going through our capital solutions business as we build the business. Going forward, we will always be expanding into new clients. I think the Athene-Athora share is kind of where it needs to be. As I jokingly said on the call, Athene wants 25% of everything and 100% of nothing; Athora wants 5% to 10% of everything. And the balance, therefore, is available to clients. Our job is to build the third party recurring client business to another 35% or 40%, leaving 15% or 20% as capital markets. Clearly, we view capital solutions as both a moneymaker in the fee business but as important as a client generator. New clients, particularly investment grade clients, who have never come to the alternatives industry, much less Apollo, are for the first time seeing that they can come and pick up to 200, 300, 400 basis points over the comparable publicly traded IG rating. And so for a portion of their portfolio, they're doing it. And while we're having a discussion, and it sounds relatively normal, this is not a product they can buy. And so they're experiencing the product for the first time through capital solutions. And as they get comfortable with the product, we're moving them into sidecars and into recurring sources of revenue. I\u2019m going to turn it to Jim. Patrick, it\u2019s Marc. I want to give you a way of thinking about this. And again, we always have to execute before. But what do we see here? This is a business that has not heretofore existed outside of the banking system. And each of the banks who own one of these businesses is competitive with the other banks. We are not a competitor to the banking system. We actually don't want what the banking system wants. We don't want the client. And I'm saying it in a confusing way. But we can\u2019t sell the client equity, advice, M&A, treasury, payments, FX, and derivatives. And the banking system wants to sell all those things. And what they don't want for the most part is the asset. So we are actually an incredible partner to the banking system. But if you're in a competitive bank or a boutique, you historically have not wanted to bring your client to this business, because you're bringing it to a competitor who's interested in the same thing that you are. Our job here is to represent a capital box, which will serve as an investment grade capital box, as Jim suggested. We will build and have a massive warehouse business. The warehouse business is a really good business. The stat I have in my mind is more than 350 billion of origination over the last seven, eight years with de minimis losses. At spreads, we believe single A credit spreads, but at very wide spreads, which then the warehouses are cleaned out through securitization, which is broadly available to a variety of investors. Our job is to scale that, but also to become the financing partner to lots of boutiques who have clients where they're nervous about bringing them to banks who are their full fledged competitors. Also, we're a great partner to existing banking system on hold positions. People who have securitizing businesses where they just don't want the hold, or they don't want the capital, bringing us in to be a side by side with them, they are bringing in someone who is not a competitor for their client. That's our job. And we have a lot of work in front of us. But Jay Kim has built an amazing team, and we're very excited about what can be done here. We expect, as I suggested previously, this will be accretive financially in 2023. But it's up to us to make it in 2023 strategically accretive to our platform. Good morning. I'll just finish it, Craig. You're going to see a tremendous amount of additional activity from Athene this year in communicating its portfolio what's going on? We have a tremendously good story to tell and the team is anxious to tell it, and they're going to be very visible and very transparent in how that gets sold. But I'll just echo where Martin and Jim started. We're just not seeing it in the portfolio. Absolute normalcy in terms of credit and we're getting paid for structure and for illiquidity and for origination. We're not getting paid for credit. Maybe I'll take the two pieces of it that Martin didn't flush out. One is in alts. One has to be stepping back and saying that if I look at the relative attractiveness of asset classes, a credit is simply more attractive than equity. And so you will see that reflected on the margin allocations from Athene. And all of this nets down into credit requires less capital than equity, which allows us to do more business. The other piece, and it's important that you track this through in the model, is we have a choice. And the choice is keep 100% of the business on the books, realize the growth in SRE and deploy our own capital, as that\u2019s Athene\u2019s balance sheet capital, or allocate a portion of the business to sidecars and essentially receive a fee for fronting that at Athene, receive FRE at Apollo for managing that and allow investors to earn the spread. Given the attractiveness of credit, this for investors is another opportunity for investors to invest in private investment grade credit with perfectly matched low cost liabilities, which is why we've seen such good take up at ADIP2 in addition to the really strong performance of ADIP1. And so as Martin suggested, we expect a very strong origination here, organically. Not even looking at inorganic where the cost of funds is now not sufficiently attractive to justify spending any money. But we will allocate more of that growth to sidecars than we will to the Athene balance sheet. And so it is not just understanding the spread of the business. It's understanding how much of the business we elect to keep. And so the second number I think you need to anchor on is we're expecting SRE growth of about 20% year-over-year. Combination of basis points margin, which in part reflects a decision between debt and equity, and then on the growth side, how much capital we want to deploy as principal versus how much we want to deploy through the sidecars? We're in a fortunate position where we have that choice. I think it's important to say, we're not in the credit risk business in what we're talking about. There's nothing about the advanced rate that is going to be different than that which that is available commercially everywhere. We want to get paid for structure and direct origination. We are not looking to get paid for credit risk unless we're in a credit fund that is supposed to get paid for credit risk. This is about avoidance. And in terms of the funding of this, the funding of this, there's very little equity funding that is required for the platform upfront. It will be funded by AAA and by third party investors side by side. And this will -- the funding structure itself is all laid out in the 10-K coming up. So we'll get back to on the absolute breakdown between new distribution and strong distribution. But it is clear to me that consumers prefer higher rates versus lower rates. And so you're seeing a tailwind to the industry. Having said that, new distribution, new pockets we opened up in the beginning of last year have been incredibly strong. And I won't steal Athene\u2019s thunder or their announcement, but they expect this year to be at least two massive launches. And so we are still early in our build out phase of expanding distribution, not to mention new suites of products and everything else. So I think there the tailwind is really good across distribution. And based on what we've seen, at least so far, early dates, it appears that '23 is off to a really good start. In terms of PRT, this is not a -- there's a lot of volume to do out there. But the only business worth doing is business that comes at acceptable spreads. And so we have a budget of what we want to do for the year, roughly 10-ish billion, and it's our job to optimize within the deals that are out there and that which provides us the greatest spread in term and the best mix of business. We expect -- and I'll say we expect that we will exceed organically in '23 what Athene did in '22. And we will likely have to make choices and temper our growth. This will not be a question of whether there's business to do. This is going to be a question of how much business we want to do."

During today\u2019s discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode. And following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference call will open for questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin the queue. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call; which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also, note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Thanks, operator, and welcome again to our call this morning. Earlier today, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site. For the third quarter, we reported fee-related earnings of $365 million, an increase of14% year-over-year or $0.61 per share and spread-related earnings of $578 million or $0.96 per share. Together, fee and spread-related earnings totaled $943 million or $1.57 per share. And in total we reported adjusted net income of $801 million, or $1.33 per share for the third quarter. Joining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Apologies in advance for sounding like a losing Texas football coach. I will do my best. I thought where I'd start is really to start with the macro or the market backdrop. I have a chart on my office wall that traces the movements of the S&P falling the 2008 financial crisis, and following the beginning of tightening in this round by the Fed. They are almost on top of each other. That is not to imply that we are going to have or experience the same sort of events that followed 2008, but I do believe it is important to comment on market psychology and investor sentiment. What did we expect would happen when we printed $8.1 trillion for the country? Well, exactly what should have happened, happened. Assets almost across the board elevated in price to multiples and levels we had never seen before. Risk was up, everything went up, interest rates went down. Now that we have begun tightening, we are doing nothing other than resetting to more normal levels. We act in the market backdrop is somehow that low interest rates and excess liquidity are the norm. They are not. Certainly not over my nearly 40-year career and not over any sort of long-term investment cycle. We have an entire generation of investors, investment analysts who have really grown up just seeing the market go in one direction. And we now all know it goes both ways. If I just chart what's happened so far this year, venture capital valuations are down 60%. Nasdaq down 30%, S&P down nearly 20%, Barclays AG down 17%. This is an amazing time for alts, alternatives, particularly for credit. Investors have now discovered that everything is correlated to the Fed. And they are also discovering that most, if not all, of last decades investment acumen was really nothing other than market beta and in some cases nothing other than levered market beta. Over the past decade, investors kind of got a free ride. There was not much need for alternatives as markets moved primarily in one direction. Yet, as an industry, alternatives grew tremendously. When I think about the market backdrop we are in today, alternatives should shine. After all, as an industry, we exist, because we produce excess return per unit of risk. And for the first time in a decade, investors are asking not just about the reward, but about the risk associated with investments. Alternatives offer diversification, in many instances, downside protection and an escape from correlation and indexation. That is the backdrop that I see for our industry. For us, this is a particularly good time. We did not chase a hot dot of growth at any price over the past decade. Our business continues to be guided by three fundamental principles: purchase price matters, excess return per unit of risk and aligned investing. As a result, we are on offense. Just in Q3, we deployed $37 billion, $175 billion in the last 12 months. Dry Powder now exceeds $50 billion. We excel in this kind of market. We are leaning in, we are out talking with investors and we are apologizing for nothing. By and large, we did what we were supposed to have done in a period of market access, which was avoid potholes. Scott will take you through some detail of our activity across yield hybrid and equity, and in particular, how active we were in the U.K as a result of LDI, which is the first I believe of many market hiccups. The proof ultimately of the strength of a franchise shows up in the numbers. As Noah already mentioned, record FRE of 365, up 14% year-over-year, record Apollo capital solutions revenues north of $100 million, as Martin will take you through. record normalized SRE of nearly $600 million, as Martin will take you through again. $100 billion of year-to-date inflows, well exceeding the $80 billion target that we put out for all of 2022 at our Investor Day last year. In terms of performance, top tier investment performance. Fund IX gross and net were 40 and 26. Direct origination strategies were up 10% year-to-date. Our Athene alternatives portfolio was up 8% in Q3. First of nearly 21% down for the S&P 500. Let me now back up a little bit and talk about the each of the individual businesses. Retirement Services is generating more volume and higher spreads. Consumers prefer 4% and 5% guaranteed yields versus 2% and 3% guaranteed yields. We have nearly $37 billion of year to date inflows. We expect to exceed $45 billion during fiscal '22. And it would not surprise me if we got really close to $50 billion. The momentum in the business is overwhelming. Not only is the business good, we are underwriting new business at really nice spreads. Whereas we used to underwrite around 100 to 110, 115 basis points, we were 130 basis points in Q3 and I expect the basis point spread to increase going into Q4. In addition, we are experiencing increasing profitability from our net floating rate position of $30 billion. This is a strategic portfolio for us. The decision and the willingness to hold $30 billion of floating rate securities means that we have foregone income that we could have maximized in prior periods in order to set ourselves up with this form of downside protection. This notion of downside protection and not being a \"current period earnings maximizer\" is what allows us to be on offense in markets like this. Martin will take you through the direct effects of being along $30 billion floaters in a highly increasing rate environment. The other nice thing about what's happening in the business is on average, the credit quality of the portfolio is going up market. We have been able to earn these spreads, taking less risk rather than more risk. We've seen minimal impact of capital on capital from ratings migration. 95% of the fixed income assets continue to be investment grade. And having excess capital which again is a luxury in our industry, allows us to be opportunistic and on offense. Let me move from Retirement Services to Apollo Asset Management. Simply said, we are on track to exceed targets from last year's Investor Day. Martin will also give you some insight to what we expect for 2023. And as you recall, we made three key bets, which were driving our Asset Management business forward. One was global wealth, AUM at the end of 5 years of $50 million. The second was Apollo Capital Solutions revenue in excess of $500 million, again at the end of 5 years, and origination volume of $150 billion annually. Let me review each of those three bets. But if you intend to tune us out, the shorthand is we're well ahead on all of those three bets. In global wealth, this market is actually showing FAs and it's showing clients that the 60-40 portfolio is not relevant anymore. I expect and our team expects that 50% of a high net worth individuals portfolio over the next 5 to 10 years will be alternative. It will not be alternative in the narrow depth definition of private equity or hedge funds. It will be alternative in the way that we mean alternative, which is an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. In this kind of volatile market where people are focused on risk reward, we are increasing mindshare as an aligned partner. If you look back and you think about what's transpired so far this year, Global Wealth AUM is up $17 billion, $8 billion from Griffin, $5.5 billion from ADS and $3.5 billion from other fundraising initiatives. $17 billion is great progress on the way to a 5-year goal. $50 billion which I fully expect that we will exceed. Our positioning in this market is not to be the largest. Our positioning in this market is to be the most innovative, known for purchase price matters, excess return per unit of risk and aligned investing. The same bargain that we have with our institutional clients is the bargain we intend to strike with our high net worth clients. AAA which I discussed in our last conference call, which is our core equity replacement product. Think of this as an alternative to S&P 500 exposure. We're already seeing great early tractions. We've been approved by three bank platforms, were we expect to launch the end of this year, the beginning of next year, and we see tremendous interest from RIA's family offices and IBDs. We have already seen as I detailed on our last call, significant corporate interest. And just to give you a sense, this portfolio is up on an annualized basis, more than 10% against the backdrop of a pretty negative S&P 500. We have been positive in all three quarters in 2022. This is what we are trying to do is to replicate S&P 500 returns plus a little, yet with fixed income like volatility. On ADS, our Apollo Debt Solutions vehicle, we were up 2.2% in the quarter, outperforming investment grade bonds, high yield bonds and levered loans. 90% of our portfolio has been put to work in 2022. Very little of the portfolio is exposed to the \"hot dot period of 2020 to 2021\". We are on offense in this vehicle. The same way we are on offense across our business. 99% of this portfolio is first-lien, which we continue to believe for high net worth investors and others is the right place to be in an uncertain market with uncertain government backdrop, with uncertain inflation expectations. Uncertainty is not a time not to invest. Uncertainty is a time to make sure you are getting paid and going in with your eyes wide open as to a range of outcomes. Furthering Global Wealth, we are seeing continued expansion and you will see us in coming quarters discuss with you what we're doing in Asia Pacific. But suffice it to say not only are we hiring, but we are seeing good leverage out of our FWD Insurance and Challenger relationships in Australia. FWD Hong Kong, Asia and Challenger in Australia, where we own majority stakes in both. To get from where we are to where we think this market is going to be, is going to require time and education. We view ourselves as innovators in this market. For those who are interested to see what we're doing, just log on to Apollo Academy. It is a powerful tool for us to engage audiences, allow FAs to earn continuing education credits, and to bring thought leadership and expand the knowledge of what an alternative is to the investing public. The early engagement is really strong. And we continue to receive accolades from our channel partners for all that we are doing to move this market along. Apollo Capital Solutions, I'll just spend a second on. As an aligned investor, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. That means we are ideally situated to work with our investors to syndicate into sidecars, into managed accounts and other flexible vehicles. Revenue this quarter was very strong. It had a goal of $500 million of revenue by 2026. It will likely be north of $400 million of revenue for 2022. I'm very optimistic, just like with Global Wealth, where we like -- I think we're likely to exceed our $50 billion AUM target, we are likely to exceed our $500 million revenue target for Apollo Capital Solutions. Somehow I get the sense that the leaders of these teams have sand backed us, but that's all good. Our job is to execute our plan not to chase the hot dot of growth. Let me now turn to the third and perhaps most important of our key bets, origination. If you run a business that is focused on excess return per unit of risk, you do not focus on growing AUM. You focus on growing your capacity to create investments that provide excess return per unit of risk. And you believe as we have seen that AUM will follow. That is how in my opinion, one generates a recurring revenue, long-term lasting franchise that investors can trust. Much of what we do in origination, as you will recall, is what we call fixed income replacement. Most of this is investment grade. We are occupying a slightly different space than most of our alternative peers. And we're occupying it because we think this is the most attractive space and we are advantaged in this particular area and we are at scale. Currently, we own or operate 13 different platforms. A platform to us is a way of generating the kinds of investment grade yield the assets that we require to consistently grow our business to feed our growing retirement services and third-party credit mandates. During the quarter, we announced the signing of a framework agreement for the Credit Suisse SPG business. This would be our 14th platform. We believe that asset-backed origination has the potential to be as large market as corporate credit. This is a product set that is primarily investment grade that fits extraordinarily well into our requirements for both our retirement services business, and the third-party business we are building. It would give us extra access to flow from more than 200 direct clients and accounts. Should we close on this transaction, which we believe we will, this would allow us to be marginally accretive going into 2023, but strategically very accretive. It will be up to us to turn this into a huge success. So we are optimistic about what this business can be in our hands, and are incredibly enthusiastic of moving to a quick closing on this transaction. Having gone through the business, let me now talk a little bit about what we're trying to build and remind how we differentiate from most other firms in the alternatives industry. Our business model is built for the long-term. The vast majority of our capital comes from our yield business and the vast majority of our yield business is fixed income replacement. Fixed income replacement is top of the capital structure, senior secured. And that's where we want to be in uncertain times. It's why we can play offense. That does not mean we are not interested in the below investment grade market or direct origination, we are. It is just not the lion's share of our business. I step back and think about again our industry. Indexation is ramping across fixed income markets and equity markets and indexation and correlation, its cousin, are just a huge source of differentiation for us as an alternative manager, the shift from defined benefit, defined contribution, is another huge source of growth. Demographics, another huge source of growth. And something not fully appreciated is the changing role of banks post Dodd-Frank. Many of the fixed income originating assets are the kinds of assets that in prior periods might have ended up on bank balance sheets. Securitization is now how American banks. We estimate and less than 20% of debt capital to U.S businesses and consumers is provided directly by the banking system. The vast majority of capital is provided by all of you through in intermediaries like us and our peers. This does not mean we are replacing the banks. Quite frankly, we are now partners with the banks. If you think about what a bank wants, for the most part, a bank wants the client. They can sell the client payments and FX, hedging, and M&A, and equity and a whole range of services that we and our peers are not really equipped, nor do I believe we will be equipped to offer. What we want is the asset. We want the asset on good terms without fees taken out in advance, where we can have a direct look to credit quality, credit underwriting to control the documentation pen [ph]. Fixed income replacement, I believe to be a vast market, where we are still in early stages of its development. And I'm confident that we can as a firm adhere to excess return per unit of risk, while growing our business. That is the challenge that I see. There is growth everywhere in the alternatives marketplace. The key is to grow while maintaining the core tenant of what an alternative is. Let me close by saying we're on offense. The year ago, almost to the day we laid out a 5-year plan, I'm confident that we're going to meet our targets which were more than doubling of earnings by 2026. The three key bets are well underway. And we have already identified the next level of growth initiatives, whether it's AAA, GPLP solutions and more to come. The accelerated hiring of the past few years is now behind us. And now it is our job to focus on simplification. The entire alternatives industry has gone from a small industry to a relatively large industry over a decade. Much of the industry has grown by adding people. We now as an industry and as a firm, we need to take time to make sure we are building the systems and operating procedures that will allow us to scale the business and return to operating leverage. Make no mistake, a return to operating leverage is in the cards, and we expect that to happen for us as early as 2023. The talent we've added most recently with our COO addition by Byron Vielehr and others, gives us the confidence that we are well set up to both grow and to be efficient in how we grow. Energy level at the firm is very high. So I want to use this opportunity not just to speak to all of you, but to thank the team, many of whom are listening for the tremendous work they have done so far in 2022. And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc. Apollo is well known for having the ability to thrive in challenging and complex economic environments. Over the past decade, amid a low interest rate backdrop, we worked hard to source attractive investment opportunities, and capture excess returns for our fund investors and retirement services clients. We were measured patient and preparing along the way. But now we've entered into a particularly favorable backdrop for our investing strategy to shine, we're on our front foot in a market that is ripe with opportunities, and we're methodically putting capital to work across our platform. In credit, the areas where we do the majority of our business, which is fixed income replacement, senior secured top of the capital structure are still open, and the recent market dislocation is creating an abundance of attractive deployment opportunities for those who can invest with size and scale. We're seeing pre-financial crisis pricing frameworks, allowing us to generate higher returns with less credit risk. For example, the yield on the CCC index one year ago is now the same as the yield on an Investment Grade index. We're buying new issued 10-year IG corporate paper between 6.25% and 6.75%. And in sterling, there's A rated opportunities yielding 7.25% to 7.5%. These attractive high grade assets are finding a home across our platform, particularly at Athene where the investment portfolio is directly benefiting from rising rates and wider spreads. In the third quarter, the weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases for Athene exceeded the BBB Corporate Bond Index by more than 80 basis points. In another recent example, our size, scale and ability to move quickly allowed us to step in and provide stability to the U.K market in response to LDI-related for selling at a favorable entry point. Trading volume skyrocketed to 800% above average levels when for selling began and we accounted for about one-third of aggregate liquidity supply. Over this 3-week period in October, our trading desk purchased $1.1 billion of AAA and AA rated CLO paper yielding over 8%. We're confident that none of our competitors were able to move this swiftly or by this significantly amid such volatility. In terms of origination, debt origination volume totaled $20 billion in the third quarter or approximately $100 billion over the last 12 months, demonstrating the significant scale we possess in generating attractive proprietary assets. With less competition in the market, we've increased pricing and tightened the credit box across several of our origination platforms, as our financing capabilities are becoming increasingly valuable. One example of this dynamic is our recent high grade partnership with Air France. This was a unique opportunity to provide one of the world's leading airlines with a custom asset-backed capital solution to deleverage and improve its borrowing costs. Apollo leverage cross platform expertise, including aviation, asset-backed financed and multi asset credit to execute the long-term investment of \u20ac500 million. In private equity, our emphasis on downside protection and purchase price discipline, as well as our ability to be flexible across multiple strategies, corporate carve outs, opportunistic buyouts and distressed situations, allows us to seek the best risk adjusted return in any market. In today's environment, increased market dislocation is providing many unique opportunities to lean in creating what we expect will be a significant tailwind for the franchise. We're operating with a pipeline that is 3x as large as it was just this time last year, and we expect to commit a significant amount of capital in the coming quarters. The credit markets are more exposed to rising interest rates than ever before, and we are diligently preparing for deployment opportunities in distressed debt. With the supply of sub-investment grade debt 3x as large as it was during the financial crisis, and with suppressed default levels for almost 15 years, we believe many corporates will need to deleverage. Our financing tools are also proving to be a tremendous differentiator, allowing us to buy companies at attractive values when most competitors are unable to transact. This was the case in the recently announced acquisition of Atlas Air through a take private transaction, totaling $5.2 billion. While most banks were effectively shut for business on new LBO commitments, we worked with our capital solutions team to structure and anchor a preferred equity tranche, reducing the required debt commitment while enhancing return potential and downside protection. This example is one of many as our ability to deploy capital in this sort of market backdrop is greatly enhanced by our integrated capital solutions business. It's worth highlighting that we've strategically invested in this business over the past year as we previously told you, and now have a dedicated team of approximately 40 professionals. We've worked diligently to align the team with several newer areas of growth across the platform and organize our corporate coverage model across thousands of entrenched relationships. As Marc noted, our investment has begun bearing fruit as we generated record quarterly transaction fees of $105 million in the third quarter, of which the vast majority is from capital solutions fees. In this backdrop, we are acting as a market stabilizer, providing liquidity and stress segments of the market and helping our banking partners work through a backlog of hung deals. While we acknowledge that transaction fees can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, we're constructive about the strategic progress we've made and remain confident in our team's ability to continue to drive growth. The robust ecosystem of asset origination capital deployment and market connectivity are crucial components of the excess return that we diligently strive to generate for our clients. As demonstrated in the third quarter results, the core tenants of our investing philosophy, purchase price discipline and downside protection are clearly setting us apart. In a public equity market backdrop that was down 5% in the third quarter and 17% over the last 12 months, our private equity portfolio had flat returns and appreciated 8% over the same respective periods. Revenue and EBITDA trends at our funds portfolio companies are up meaningfully year-over-year, and they're actively managing margin risk by implementing cost saving measures and passing through price increases. Elsewhere, our hybrid value portfolio continues to perform well, appreciating 1% in the third quarter and over 4% year-to-date. In our yield strategy, we are really a performing credit investor that looks to make reasonable loans and get paid back. Our corporate credit and structured credit strategies appreciated 1% in the third quarter, while our direct origination portfolio appreciated over 3%, showcasing disciplined credit underwriting and superior security selection. Athene's alternative portfolio generated an 8% annualized return in the third quarter, continuing to benefit from the diversified and defensive characteristics that it has exhibited over time. Within the portfolio origination platforms and strategic retirement service investments returned 12% and 4%, respectively, in the -- while fund investments returned 8% aided by strong performance in real assets and higher cash flows from a few structure deals in our yield funds. There are several qualities of Athene's alternative portfolio that drive resilient performance amid more challenged equity markets, including high current cash flow for our origination platforms, structuring of underlying assets to allow for faster paydown and amortization, and timely redeployment of capital. These structural qualities create downside protection when public markets are volatile, which is proving increasingly valuable in today's market backdrop. Moving to our fundraising results. Third quarter inflows of $34 billion were strong and diversified across our platform. Asset Management inflows totaled $21 billion and included $17 billion from third-party fundraising, including Fund X and our newly launched S3 platform. Notably, we began third-party capital fundraising for our non-traded REIT, Apollo Realty Income Solutions, or ARIS, in late September. As we look to close out the year, we expect another quarter of healthy fundraising, including additional Fund X capital as well as the successful equity capital raise for Athora. So far, we've helped Athora raised over \u20ac2 billion of new common equity capital this year, with high visibility to bringing the total to over \u20ac2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We believe Athora is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a vast near-term market opportunity in Europe, and this new capital will allow them to execute on their strong pipeline of both inorganic and organic growth and to continue growing at this rapid pace. In regards to the ongoing Fund X capital raise, our conversations and diligence efforts with limited partners remain very constructive as our differentiated investment philosophy and strong long-term track record are setting us apart from other funds in the market. Through the end of October, we've received commitments of approximately $14.5 billion. Due to the impacts of the denominator effect in the sheer number of GPs in the market this year, we've agreed to keep the fund open until the first half of '23 to accommodate our investors' annual allocation budgets. We remain confident in reaching our $25 billion target fund size and importantly, all capital closed in the remainder of '22 or the first part of '23 will accrue fees back to the fund's fee commencement date, which we activated on October 1. Turning to our retirement service inflows, Athene had a stellar quarter of record inorganic growth, as the value proposition of principal protected yield-focused products are proving to be increasingly attractive in today's market. Total inflows of $13 billion in the third quarter included a record $6 billion from the retail annuity channel as fixed rate products with attractive rates were in high demand and continued distribution expansion within large financial institutions helped as well. Flow reinsurance also benefited from these trends as well as growing traction from our expanding partnerships in Asia Pacific, with its second best inflow quarter ever. Importantly, the duration and stickiness of Athene's funding is highly predictable, and we have not seen any material change in customer behavior so far this year. Before turning it over to Martin, I'd like to pick up on a discussion that I outlined at our Investor Day approximately a year ago. We see ample white space opportunities tangential to our existing businesses that can drive accelerated growth above our base case targets. There are a few very large and growing sectors, which typically trade at higher multiples where we have not been historically active such as fintech, life science and software. Over the past 18 months, we've selectively cultivated strategically and economically aligned partnerships with best-in-class managers in each of these areas to expand the breadth of our platform and expertise. Our investment in Motive, a specialist fintech private equity firm, was our first partnership in the growth space. This relationship has fostered several tangible benefits already, such as providing proprietary investment origination, helping in transaction due diligence within specialized sectors, building out retail distribution technology, working on product innovation with Apollo and Athene and driving efficiency enhancements across Apollo's operating structure. More recently, we announced strategic and financial relationships with SoFi Nova, a leading European life science venture capital firm, earlier this year as well as Haveli, a premier enterprise software and gaming private equity firm. We expect these more recent investments to be just as successful as what we've accomplished with Motive in just over a year. So with that, let me stop there and hand it over to Martin.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So echoing Marc and Scott's sentiment this morning, this is the type of environment where Apollo really shines. Our key business drivers, including capital deployment, investment performance and fundraising, remains strong. And our financial results reflect continued momentum across our primary earnings streams. The stability, quality and recurring nature of our earnings power provides comfort in these volatile markets. Management fees accounted for more than 80% of fee-related revenue, both in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. And we experienced only an estimated 1% annualized drag on our management fees quarter-over-quarter from market value declines. Importantly, fee and spread-related earnings accounted for approximately 95% of total pre-tax earnings in the third quarter. As Marc said, we're on track to meet our 5-year targets that we laid out at Investor Day last year, which includes more than doubling both FRE and total earnings. Starting with our AUM results, third quarter AUM reached $523 billion, increasing 2% quarter-over-quarter and 9% year-over-year. Inflows totaled $34 billion in the third quarter as we raised significant amounts of capital from both our asset management and retirement services clients. Total outflows of $10 billion in the quarter included $6 billion from normal course of same runoff, which increased from the prior quarter due to several expected funding agreement maturities as well as the first of its kind partial repurchase of existing notes in an effort to tighten our trading spreads. Realizations of $10 billion, included $6 billion related to the reallocation of a limited partner's existing mandate to other strategies. In a similar dynamic to last quarter, most of the third quarter negative market activity was driven by unfavorable FX translation from Athora's portfolio due to a depreciation of the euro. Moving to FRE, we reported third quarter fee-related earnings of $365 million as previously referenced or $0.61 per share, which increased 14% year-over-year and reflected continuing momentum in our results after increases of 3% and 7% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Amid turbulent markets, fee revenue growth exceeding 20% year-over-year was very strong and included 16% growth in management fees. On a sequential basis, yield management fees benefited from a full quarter of Griffin fees and the expiration of a 6-month fee waiver for the non-traded credit BDC we manage, Apollo Jet Solutions. ADS contributed an incremental $5.5 million to each of management fees and fee-related performance fees in the third quarter. And as Scott noted, we turned on management fees for Fund X on October 1, at which point the fee base is for Fund IX step down from committed to remaining invested capital at a slightly lower fee rate. The combination of these two events will be modestly accretive to our fourth quarter equity management fees and we will benefit from higher run rate and catch-up fees with successive closes. In terms of expenses, comp and non-comp expenses increased on a sequential basis as expected, as the impact of growth in our headcount continues to run through our cost base. Overall, we have good visibility into fourth quarter results and continue to feel confident in meeting our $2.35 per share FRE target for this year. As we look to 2023, we still expect fee revenue growth of more than 20%, driven by revenue accretion from new strategic growth initiatives, robust organic inflows from our retirement services clients, fees from additional capital for Fund X and continued progress in our capital solutions build out. With our period of accelerated investment spend to support our fast growing platform behind us, we expect to generate positive operating leverage next year as we move toward our long-term FRE margin target of 60% plus by 2026. With a very strong revenue growth outlook and moderating expense growth, we are targeting FRE growth of around 25% in 2023, above our multiyear compound annual growth target of 18%. Moving to our Retirement Services segment, we generated SRE of $578 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter, which represents a net spread of 120 basis points [audio gap] as a percentage of average net investment assets. Normalizing our alternative returns to 11% and excluding certain notable items, SRE, as Marc noted, was $598 million in the third quarter, translating to a normalized net spread of 124 basis points. On a sequential quarterly basis, our normalized net spread increased 9 basis points, driven by 11 basis points of net accretion, both from higher floating rate income and higher on-the-margin purchases due to rising interest rates, partially offset by 2 basis points of higher operating expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our OpEx reflects higher costs associated with building at our platform capacity, and we view this as a reasonable run rate in the near-term. We've been a beneficiary of this rising rate environment with higher short-term interest rates generating approximately $100 million of incremental SRE from our net floating rate income in the first 9 months versus the comparable period of 2021, with $60 million of this increase or $0.10 a share in the third quarter. We expect this amount to rise further, due to the timing of rate basis resets. This dynamic as well as attractive deployment opportunities should continue benefiting the underlying profitability of our Retirement Services segment, translating to an expected normalized net spread of approximately 135 basis points in the fourth quarter. And just to underscore the strength of Athene's business, a year ago, we laid out an indication of $3.35 per share of spread-related earnings this year. We expect to report closer to $4 per share, with three benefits: higher rates on the floating rate portfolio, organic growth, exceeding our plans and a favorable investing environment. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect this favorable interest rate uplift, coupled with robust organic inflow outlook, to drive above average normalized SRE growth next year relative to our 11% multiyear compound annual growth expectation. Turning to Principal Investing. We reported PII of $50 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Realized performance fees of $93 million were light, as expected, as we are being patient in monetizing investments to help maximize return potential for the benefit of our fund investors. Lastly, our business generates a substantial amount of free cash flow, and we expect to deploy $15 billion of capital through 2026 in strategic growth investments, funding the base dividend and both growing the base dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $200 million of capital on HoldCo investments to drive future FRE growth as well as approximately $50 million on share repurchases. As a reminder, we spent $200 million on buybacks in Q2, and we would have engaged in additional share activity in Q3 if it weren't for restrictions during the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to be more active in buying back our stock, particularly in times when, in our opinion, our stock is clearly undervalued. We remain comfortable with our strong liquidity position, including a net balance sheet value at the holding company of $2.1 billion or $3.50 per share, with cash and equivalents of more than $2 billion. In closing, I'd like to reiterate a central theme of our remarks this morning. We are very well-positioned to capitalize on a growing pipeline of opportunities in this market backdrop and generate excess return for our clients. A year removed from our milestone Investor Day, we are even more confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and are diligently executing against our attractive growth plan, aimed at benefiting all our stakeholders. With that, we thank you for joining the call, and we'll open up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Davitt: Hey, good morning, everyone. I have a follow-up question on the Wealth Management business. I appreciate all the color, Marc, you gave us there. Could you give us a little more specifics on how the flows looked in all those major products in 3Q versus 2Q? And then more broadly, are you still confident in the ability to launch one or two products a quarter, ramp that business through much more volatile markets?\nScott Kleinman: Yes, hi. This is Scott. So, yes, flows have actually been building quite nicely. As we had told you, we expected about $6 billion of inflows this year, the first year of our global wealth activities. And it's been building sort of steadily quarter-on-quarter. And -- so we feel quite good about that number, in all likelihood exceeding that number. That has been coming in through ADS, as Marc talked about. This quarter, we launched AAA. We just launched ARIS, our real estate product. And then, of course, some of the drawdown funds that are working through this global wealth system as well, namely Fund X, has been moving forward. So continue to go quite well in that area. We do have some exciting launches early next year. We've talked to you about our ensuring that products that we'll be launching next year as well as a couple of others that will be coming more midyear. So yes, feeling very good about where we are going. And really, our first year in earnest in the global wealth channel has been a real success.\nPatrick Davitt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to some of the comments Marc you had made, and Scott as well. Marc, you had referenced the U.K. market hiccup as maybe being the first of many. I was hoping you might be able to expand on that what you see potentially coming where the next pickup might arise, what might cause that how? Apollo might be able to capitalize on that opportunity? And then, Scott, you mentioned about distressed investing, that you're preparing for that. Can you maybe just expand upon your outlook and how you see that playing out this cycle?\nMarc Rowan: Why don't I start on the macro side, and then I will let Scott add some color. So if you go back to Dodd-Frank and the changes that happened in our system, beginning in 2008, one of the changes that happened was an increase in the, I will say, penalty of the cost of providing trading capital. By our estimate, we have roughly the same amount of market making capital in the system today as we had in 2008, with markets significantly larger. One of the things we are seeing across every market is a decrease in liquidity, and this is not just a structured product phenomenon, this is a treasury market. There was an article yesterday talking about that. And as I like to say to our clients, we now are in a market where there's only liquidity on the way up. There is not liquidity on the way down. The public markets are less liquid. The private markets are more liquid. And so we are seeing a gradual trend toward increased private liquidity, decreased public liquidity. And as a result, when you have short-term capital calls or short-term phenomenon, you end up with all manner of market-based kind of illiquidity, particularly when everyone is looking for the same door at the same time.\nScott Kleinman: Yes. Let me just add on what Marc said, while we can't necessarily predict exactly where those movements will come, 14 years of 0% interest rates has led markets to pursue increasingly levered strategies to try to find yield and return. And now that we are in a rising rate environment and those levered trades have to unwind, that they all happen at once, right? The LDI transaction that I referenced didn't -- there was nothing inherently wrong with the CLO tranches we were buying, it's just that happened to be the most liquid asset that those entities had to liquidate in order to cover their leverage and margin issues. And so those are the types of things -- so being ready, having the breadth and scale of platform to take advantage of that when you see those cracks happening, that's the opportunity.\nMarc Rowan: You have to, again, propitiate [ph]. We've lived in 10 years of benign environment, with increasing liquidity and low rates. And this mismatch of daily liquid products, with non-daily liquid assets, is across our financial system. We saw it in March of 2020, in the beginning of the pandemic, where it happened in open enter mutual funds and ETFs. We've now seen it in LDI. And we will continue to see that because I step back again to the macro. Our system is designed today such that things are only liquid on the way up there, not liquid on the way down. And if you have any sort of event where investors all run for the same door, at the same time, there is no longer the dealer capital in the system to serve as a buffer to allow for usual business as usual price expectations. To be willing, to be able to participate in that market, you have to have not done something over the past 10 years. You have to have not fully invested your balance sheet, fully deployed your capital, try to maximize your earnings in a period that was very easy to try and do that. And so what you find is many investors, many institutions today, are offsite. They are essentially fully deployed. I think about the insurance industry and the publicly traded insurers over the past decade. U.S. and Europe have raised closer to 0 than $1 billion of capital and have paid out roughly 90% of their current market cap as dividends. That means people are not saying overexposed, but they're not in a position where they are net buyers and large size on market dislocation. We try and run our European, our U.S. business and our fund businesses, such that in the -- once a decade, once or twice a decade opportunity, we can be really large buyers of mispriced risk. And to do that, you have to be patient every day. And I come back to you with the hardest thing to do running a competitive investment firm is not to chase the hot dot, just to sit and do nothing and wait.\nScott Kleinman: And Mike, just to quickly answer your distressed question. So as you look at the credit markets right now, if you were to look at the indexes per se, we are certainly not in distressed territory yet. Although, name by name, you are starting to find some interesting situations moving in that direction. Fund X has started to accumulate positions in a few names so far, but our watch list is -- stretches into the hundreds. The key -- as I've said in the past, the key to successful distressed and distressed investing is to be ready, right? When the markets move, they move, and you can't start analyzing your names, your credits at that moment. You have to have fully built out investment thesis around not only which names, but where in the capital structure or what prices you're interested in investing. And our teams are, at this point, fully sort of built up and prepared awaiting for those moments to happen, which, I mean, nobody has a crystal ball, but we will probably roll into early next year when you start to see that happen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Finian O'Shea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. A question on the Credit Suisse SPG business. Can you talk about the potential or expected impact to your direct origination volumes?\nMarc Rowan: It's Marc. I think it's too early to say what direct origination volumes would be. But I will come back to what I see as the macro opportunity, and this is how I frame the opportunity. Dodd-Frank, sufficient in the accompanying regulatory reform in Europe, shrunk the size of the banking system, made more of the banking systems products, investment products. The way I see U.S. consumers and companies banking today is through the structured products market, through people like us and like Credit Suisse. I believe that the structured product market can be the size of the corporate credit market. And for us, this is a slice of it. This is the top of the capital structure, generally AAA, AA, and it has relationships with 200 different entities. The transaction will initially -- is a vision to initially be funded by ourselves and by PIMCO. And it is our job, not just to take something that is already of size and scale, but to grow it from there. So I think it's early to predict how much origination will come out of this. But suffice it to say, it's going to be up to us to build a franchise around this and to retain the clients and the people necessary to go do that. But we are very optimistic, and we would not have leaned in with all of the resources that we did if we didn't think this was a needle mover with respect to our origination capability.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rufus Hon of BMO. Please go ahead.\nRufus Hone: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. I was hoping you could spend a minute on AAA specifically. And you mentioned last quarter that you think this has the potential to be the largest single product or fund for Apollo. So how are your conversations progressing with institutions and what do you still need to do in order to get this into the retail channel? And when could we start to see flows from retail come in? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: So it's Marc. I will come back to you. So we launched with approximately $10 billion from Athene, $1.5 billion from SuMi TRUST and $3.5 billion of other institutional commitments. If I look at things that have come out of global wealth and retail, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it's something $200 million, $300 million. I would expect us to cross the $500 million, $600 million of new money beyond that by year-end. But we really will see -- we are now accepted for wealth distribution channels on a number of platforms, really focused on the first quarter, and I think you will see growth in '23. It is now up to us to take a product that we think makes sense and explain it to the market and prove out success. So it's now the hard work is on us. But I step back, we are offering investors side-by-side alignment with us for de minimis or no incremental fee on a fully diversified, no J-curve portfolio, where they have liquidity, 5% a quarter, and we do not. The initial conversations have been very encouraging, but it is now up to us to execute.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I wanted to circle back on the capital return philosophy. The platform has gotten much bigger you guys are exceeding your near-term earnings expectations and the excess capital continues to build. So I guess, near-term, I think, Martin, you mentioned that you guys were blacked out in the quarter, and that's one of the reasons why you couldn't do much for buybacks. Was that to Credit Suisse or something else? And I guess more importantly, as you look out into 2023 with kind of the dynamics that I mentioned, what are your expectations for total payout between dividends and buybacks? Thanks.\nMartin Kelly: So we were restricted. I won't go into the reasons we were restricted, but we were not able to buy back more than we did, which is a de minimis amount in the quarter. If you look at what we've done this year, we've actually spent about $1.8 billion between the dividend and strategic investments, and that included about $200 million of buyback in Q2. That's sort of a -- and we earn our way into the $15 billion of investment capacity over time. So you need to own it to spend it. As we look at our capital uses around the system, Athene is growing more rapidly than we thought. And $1 of growth in Athene is highly accretive in terms of export through FRE and SRE. And then we also believe that $1 of capital spent to buy back stock is also very accretive given our earnings expectations. So I think, Alex, you'll see us do both. It's a balance. Part of the balance is the role that beta [ph] plays as the equity [indiscernible], which is -- which provides important leverage to earnings without capital. So we will return in the early part of next year with more around what we expect the capital return plans to be. But I think you should expect us to see us do both lean into growing Athene because it's highly accretive and buy back stock. And then at the same time, we will continue to look at strategic growth alternatives around the system, including some of what we've done this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Similar to AAA, similar question on Apollo Realty Income Engine Solutions, the new non-traded REIT product, can you talk about how you see that being differentiated in a market where more of these products are beginning to come out? And then maybe just also a comment on the retail sort of risk off behavior that we are seeing in the market? How are these conversations resonating? And do you expect -- do you think you need a risk on behavior to accelerate sales in the retail channel? Or do you think your story will really resonate as a differentiator and therefore, generate organic growth based on that?\nScott Kleinman: Yes. This is Scott. I will answer both of those. On the real estate product, we believe we do. Like every investment product we have, Apollo takes a slightly different approach than the rest of the market. A more value-oriented purchase price matters approach really seems to be early resonating with some of the channel partners that we've been talking to as we get this product launched. So I actually do think we have a differentiated product that should start to gain some real traction. As far as the market itself, the Global Wealth and retail market, look, fortunately for us, we are starting our journey this year in many of these products. So we have only one direction to go, which is up. And so while we do know that others have reported, I think, some suppressed or depressed volume levels, that's not what we are seeing right now. We are moving in kind of an up and to the right type of trajectory. I think it also helps the fact that we are building these portfolios today in a '22 rate environment and asset value environment where we are not loaded with, what I'll call, top of the market, huge asset purchase is top of the market in '20 and '21. And that I think investors see as a real opportunity to put dollars to work and then start putting dollars to work in a really attractive way. So all in all, like I said, we feel really good about where we are headed, albeit starting from a much lower base than others. Feel really good about where our global wealth business is headed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the disclosure on the annualized outflow rates in the insurance business. It looks like the policyholder driven withdrawals hasn't -- the rate in the quarter, it wasn't really changed over the last 12 months. I'm just curious how that kind of compares over a longer time horizon? And then you mentioned some kind of seasonality with the maturity driven contractual outflows. I'm just curious if the normalized rate should look more like the 2.5 or so we saw over the last year? Or you could kind of give any color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Yes, Ben, you're exactly right on the first piece. So I think of this as sort of contractual or within our control is sort of one category. That will be more volatile. And then there's policyholder driven, which is sort of behavioral. And the policyholder driven, you should always expect that there's some amount of policyholder withdrawals and outflows. And we had a 7% annualized rate in the quarter. We had a 7% annualized rate for the last 12 months. It's in line with our plans. And policyholders access their policies to get cash for a variety of reasons, that's just part of the business. So we are not seeing any real change in that relative to history or our expectations, and that's the higher focus point. The contractual is a combination of both some particular funding agreements maturing. And we were in the market, as I mentioned, buying back funding agreements during the quarter, and that was sort of a decision that we made. So that number -- funding agreements tend to have a shorter duration to them. And so you do need to be in the market issuing funding agreements, and we will access that more fully when the market is there. But we're much less concerned about that. That's a market where we're a leader in and we've got good names and spreads. We've provided that extra disclosure on behavioral surrenders to provide more clarity and sort of comfort around that piece of the outpost.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerald O'Hara of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGerald O'Hara: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Perhaps a tough one, but clearly a strong quarter from a transaction fee environment or a transaction fee, I guess, reported number. Is there anything you can sort of give us a sense of where the baseline for this might be? Or perhaps just kind of what to look for in terms of kind of puts and takes from a backdrop in the environment to kind of help us build this on a go-forward basis?\nScott Kleinman: Yes. Look, so as I alluded to in my prepared comments, the transaction fees are inherently -- there is an inherent up and down in that business line. But I would think of it more as an upwardly sloping sign curve, right? In any given quarter, I can't tell you does the transaction close on this side of the quarter or the far side of the quarter. But I do know, given the scale and breadth of what we've been building that we are step functioning the volume and capacity -- the capacity to earn and generate fees on an increasing basis. And so we do see that trajectory moving. As you know, we put out a 5-year target of $500 million of revenues. As Marc alluded to, we will be right around $400 million for this year. So we are moving that upwardly -- we are moving up that slope, I'd say, even quicker than we had originally anticipated and expect that to continue to chug along. So like I said, it's a -- you can't predict any one transaction in any one quarter, but as your breadth and volume grows, you do see that trend of upwardly sloping.\nOperator: And that concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now return the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing remarks.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Apollo. If you have any questions on anything we discuss on today's call, please feel free to reach out to us, and we look forward to connecting with you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Kleinman",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. Apollo is well known for having the ability to thrive in challenging and complex economic environments. Over the past decade, amid a low interest rate backdrop, we worked hard to source attractive investment opportunities, and capture excess returns for our fund investors and retirement services clients. We were measured patient and preparing along the way. But now we've entered into a particularly favorable backdrop for our investing strategy to shine, we're on our front foot in a market that is ripe with opportunities, and we're methodically putting capital to work across our platform. In credit, the areas where we do the majority of our business, which is fixed income replacement, senior secured top of the capital structure are still open, and the recent market dislocation is creating an abundance of attractive deployment opportunities for those who can invest with size and scale. We're seeing pre-financial crisis pricing frameworks, allowing us to generate higher returns with less credit risk. For example, the yield on the CCC index one year ago is now the same as the yield on an Investment Grade index. We're buying new issued 10-year IG corporate paper between 6.25% and 6.75%. And in sterling, there's A rated opportunities yielding 7.25% to 7.5%. These attractive high grade assets are finding a home across our platform, particularly at Athene where the investment portfolio is directly benefiting from rising rates and wider spreads. In the third quarter, the weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases for Athene exceeded the BBB Corporate Bond Index by more than 80 basis points. In another recent example, our size, scale and ability to move quickly allowed us to step in and provide stability to the U.K market in response to LDI-related for selling at a favorable entry point. Trading volume skyrocketed to 800% above average levels when for selling began and we accounted for about one-third of aggregate liquidity supply. Over this 3-week period in October, our trading desk purchased $1.1 billion of AAA and AA rated CLO paper yielding over 8%. We're confident that none of our competitors were able to move this swiftly or by this significantly amid such volatility. In terms of origination, debt origination volume totaled $20 billion in the third quarter or approximately $100 billion over the last 12 months, demonstrating the significant scale we possess in generating attractive proprietary assets. With less competition in the market, we've increased pricing and tightened the credit box across several of our origination platforms, as our financing capabilities are becoming increasingly valuable. One example of this dynamic is our recent high grade partnership with Air France. This was a unique opportunity to provide one of the world's leading airlines with a custom asset-backed capital solution to deleverage and improve its borrowing costs. Apollo leverage cross platform expertise, including aviation, asset-backed financed and multi asset credit to execute the long-term investment of \u20ac500 million. In private equity, our emphasis on downside protection and purchase price discipline, as well as our ability to be flexible across multiple strategies, corporate carve outs, opportunistic buyouts and distressed situations, allows us to seek the best risk adjusted return in any market. In today's environment, increased market dislocation is providing many unique opportunities to lean in creating what we expect will be a significant tailwind for the franchise. We're operating with a pipeline that is 3x as large as it was just this time last year, and we expect to commit a significant amount of capital in the coming quarters. The credit markets are more exposed to rising interest rates than ever before, and we are diligently preparing for deployment opportunities in distressed debt. With the supply of sub-investment grade debt 3x as large as it was during the financial crisis, and with suppressed default levels for almost 15 years, we believe many corporates will need to deleverage. Our financing tools are also proving to be a tremendous differentiator, allowing us to buy companies at attractive values when most competitors are unable to transact. This was the case in the recently announced acquisition of Atlas Air through a take private transaction, totaling $5.2 billion. While most banks were effectively shut for business on new LBO commitments, we worked with our capital solutions team to structure and anchor a preferred equity tranche, reducing the required debt commitment while enhancing return potential and downside protection. This example is one of many as our ability to deploy capital in this sort of market backdrop is greatly enhanced by our integrated capital solutions business. It's worth highlighting that we've strategically invested in this business over the past year as we previously told you, and now have a dedicated team of approximately 40 professionals. We've worked diligently to align the team with several newer areas of growth across the platform and organize our corporate coverage model across thousands of entrenched relationships. As Marc noted, our investment has begun bearing fruit as we generated record quarterly transaction fees of $105 million in the third quarter, of which the vast majority is from capital solutions fees. In this backdrop, we are acting as a market stabilizer, providing liquidity and stress segments of the market and helping our banking partners work through a backlog of hung deals. While we acknowledge that transaction fees can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, we're constructive about the strategic progress we've made and remain confident in our team's ability to continue to drive growth. The robust ecosystem of asset origination capital deployment and market connectivity are crucial components of the excess return that we diligently strive to generate for our clients. As demonstrated in the third quarter results, the core tenants of our investing philosophy, purchase price discipline and downside protection are clearly setting us apart. In a public equity market backdrop that was down 5% in the third quarter and 17% over the last 12 months, our private equity portfolio had flat returns and appreciated 8% over the same respective periods. Revenue and EBITDA trends at our funds portfolio companies are up meaningfully year-over-year, and they're actively managing margin risk by implementing cost saving measures and passing through price increases. Elsewhere, our hybrid value portfolio continues to perform well, appreciating 1% in the third quarter and over 4% year-to-date. In our yield strategy, we are really a performing credit investor that looks to make reasonable loans and get paid back. Our corporate credit and structured credit strategies appreciated 1% in the third quarter, while our direct origination portfolio appreciated over 3%, showcasing disciplined credit underwriting and superior security selection. Athene's alternative portfolio generated an 8% annualized return in the third quarter, continuing to benefit from the diversified and defensive characteristics that it has exhibited over time. Within the portfolio origination platforms and strategic retirement service investments returned 12% and 4%, respectively, in the -- while fund investments returned 8% aided by strong performance in real assets and higher cash flows from a few structure deals in our yield funds. There are several qualities of Athene's alternative portfolio that drive resilient performance amid more challenged equity markets, including high current cash flow for our origination platforms, structuring of underlying assets to allow for faster paydown and amortization, and timely redeployment of capital. These structural qualities create downside protection when public markets are volatile, which is proving increasingly valuable in today's market backdrop. Moving to our fundraising results. Third quarter inflows of $34 billion were strong and diversified across our platform. Asset Management inflows totaled $21 billion and included $17 billion from third-party fundraising, including Fund X and our newly launched S3 platform. Notably, we began third-party capital fundraising for our non-traded REIT, Apollo Realty Income Solutions, or ARIS, in late September. As we look to close out the year, we expect another quarter of healthy fundraising, including additional Fund X capital as well as the successful equity capital raise for Athora. So far, we've helped Athora raised over \u20ac2 billion of new common equity capital this year, with high visibility to bringing the total to over \u20ac2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We believe Athora is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a vast near-term market opportunity in Europe, and this new capital will allow them to execute on their strong pipeline of both inorganic and organic growth and to continue growing at this rapid pace. In regards to the ongoing Fund X capital raise, our conversations and diligence efforts with limited partners remain very constructive as our differentiated investment philosophy and strong long-term track record are setting us apart from other funds in the market. Through the end of October, we've received commitments of approximately $14.5 billion. Due to the impacts of the denominator effect in the sheer number of GPs in the market this year, we've agreed to keep the fund open until the first half of '23 to accommodate our investors' annual allocation budgets. We remain confident in reaching our $25 billion target fund size and importantly, all capital closed in the remainder of '22 or the first part of '23 will accrue fees back to the fund's fee commencement date, which we activated on October 1. Turning to our retirement service inflows, Athene had a stellar quarter of record inorganic growth, as the value proposition of principal protected yield-focused products are proving to be increasingly attractive in today's market. Total inflows of $13 billion in the third quarter included a record $6 billion from the retail annuity channel as fixed rate products with attractive rates were in high demand and continued distribution expansion within large financial institutions helped as well. Flow reinsurance also benefited from these trends as well as growing traction from our expanding partnerships in Asia Pacific, with its second best inflow quarter ever. Importantly, the duration and stickiness of Athene's funding is highly predictable, and we have not seen any material change in customer behavior so far this year. Before turning it over to Martin, I'd like to pick up on a discussion that I outlined at our Investor Day approximately a year ago. We see ample white space opportunities tangential to our existing businesses that can drive accelerated growth above our base case targets. There are a few very large and growing sectors, which typically trade at higher multiples where we have not been historically active such as fintech, life science and software. Over the past 18 months, we've selectively cultivated strategically and economically aligned partnerships with best-in-class managers in each of these areas to expand the breadth of our platform and expertise. Our investment in Motive, a specialist fintech private equity firm, was our first partnership in the growth space. This relationship has fostered several tangible benefits already, such as providing proprietary investment origination, helping in transaction due diligence within specialized sectors, building out retail distribution technology, working on product innovation with Apollo and Athene and driving efficiency enhancements across Apollo's operating structure. More recently, we announced strategic and financial relationships with SoFi Nova, a leading European life science venture capital firm, earlier this year as well as Haveli, a premier enterprise software and gaming private equity firm. We expect these more recent investments to be just as successful as what we've accomplished with Motive in just over a year. So with that, let me stop there and hand it over to Martin. Yes, hi. This is Scott. So, yes, flows have actually been building quite nicely. As we had told you, we expected about $6 billion of inflows this year, the first year of our global wealth activities. And it's been building sort of steadily quarter-on-quarter. And -- so we feel quite good about that number, in all likelihood exceeding that number. That has been coming in through ADS, as Marc talked about. This quarter, we launched AAA. We just launched ARIS, our real estate product. And then, of course, some of the drawdown funds that are working through this global wealth system as well, namely Fund X, has been moving forward. So continue to go quite well in that area. We do have some exciting launches early next year. We've talked to you about our ensuring that products that we'll be launching next year as well as a couple of others that will be coming more midyear. So yes, feeling very good about where we are going. And really, our first year in earnest in the global wealth channel has been a real success. Yes. Let me just add on what Marc said, while we can't necessarily predict exactly where those movements will come, 14 years of 0% interest rates has led markets to pursue increasingly levered strategies to try to find yield and return. And now that we are in a rising rate environment and those levered trades have to unwind, that they all happen at once, right? The LDI transaction that I referenced didn't -- there was nothing inherently wrong with the CLO tranches we were buying, it's just that happened to be the most liquid asset that those entities had to liquidate in order to cover their leverage and margin issues. And so those are the types of things -- so being ready, having the breadth and scale of platform to take advantage of that when you see those cracks happening, that's the opportunity. And Mike, just to quickly answer your distressed question. So as you look at the credit markets right now, if you were to look at the indexes per se, we are certainly not in distressed territory yet. Although, name by name, you are starting to find some interesting situations moving in that direction. Fund X has started to accumulate positions in a few names so far, but our watch list is -- stretches into the hundreds. The key -- as I've said in the past, the key to successful distressed and distressed investing is to be ready, right? When the markets move, they move, and you can't start analyzing your names, your credits at that moment. You have to have fully built out investment thesis around not only which names, but where in the capital structure or what prices you're interested in investing. And our teams are, at this point, fully sort of built up and prepared awaiting for those moments to happen, which, I mean, nobody has a crystal ball, but we will probably roll into early next year when you start to see that happen. Yes. This is Scott. I will answer both of those. On the real estate product, we believe we do. Like every investment product we have, Apollo takes a slightly different approach than the rest of the market. A more value-oriented purchase price matters approach really seems to be early resonating with some of the channel partners that we've been talking to as we get this product launched. So I actually do think we have a differentiated product that should start to gain some real traction. As far as the market itself, the Global Wealth and retail market, look, fortunately for us, we are starting our journey this year in many of these products. So we have only one direction to go, which is up. And so while we do know that others have reported, I think, some suppressed or depressed volume levels, that's not what we are seeing right now. We are moving in kind of an up and to the right type of trajectory. I think it also helps the fact that we are building these portfolios today in a '22 rate environment and asset value environment where we are not loaded with, what I'll call, top of the market, huge asset purchase is top of the market in '20 and '21. And that I think investors see as a real opportunity to put dollars to work and then start putting dollars to work in a really attractive way. So all in all, like I said, we feel really good about where we are headed, albeit starting from a much lower base than others. Feel really good about where our global wealth business is headed. Yes. Look, so as I alluded to in my prepared comments, the transaction fees are inherently -- there is an inherent up and down in that business line. But I would think of it more as an upwardly sloping sign curve, right? In any given quarter, I can't tell you does the transaction close on this side of the quarter or the far side of the quarter. But I do know, given the scale and breadth of what we've been building that we are step functioning the volume and capacity -- the capacity to earn and generate fees on an increasing basis. And so we do see that trajectory moving. As you know, we put out a 5-year target of $500 million of revenues. As Marc alluded to, we will be right around $400 million for this year. So we are moving that upwardly -- we are moving up that slope, I'd say, even quicker than we had originally anticipated and expect that to continue to chug along. So like I said, it's a -- you can't predict any one transaction in any one quarter, but as your breadth and volume grows, you do see that trend of upwardly sloping."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So echoing Marc and Scott's sentiment this morning, this is the type of environment where Apollo really shines. Our key business drivers, including capital deployment, investment performance and fundraising, remains strong. And our financial results reflect continued momentum across our primary earnings streams. The stability, quality and recurring nature of our earnings power provides comfort in these volatile markets. Management fees accounted for more than 80% of fee-related revenue, both in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. And we experienced only an estimated 1% annualized drag on our management fees quarter-over-quarter from market value declines. Importantly, fee and spread-related earnings accounted for approximately 95% of total pre-tax earnings in the third quarter. As Marc said, we're on track to meet our 5-year targets that we laid out at Investor Day last year, which includes more than doubling both FRE and total earnings. Starting with our AUM results, third quarter AUM reached $523 billion, increasing 2% quarter-over-quarter and 9% year-over-year. Inflows totaled $34 billion in the third quarter as we raised significant amounts of capital from both our asset management and retirement services clients. Total outflows of $10 billion in the quarter included $6 billion from normal course of same runoff, which increased from the prior quarter due to several expected funding agreement maturities as well as the first of its kind partial repurchase of existing notes in an effort to tighten our trading spreads. Realizations of $10 billion, included $6 billion related to the reallocation of a limited partner's existing mandate to other strategies. In a similar dynamic to last quarter, most of the third quarter negative market activity was driven by unfavorable FX translation from Athora's portfolio due to a depreciation of the euro. Moving to FRE, we reported third quarter fee-related earnings of $365 million as previously referenced or $0.61 per share, which increased 14% year-over-year and reflected continuing momentum in our results after increases of 3% and 7% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Amid turbulent markets, fee revenue growth exceeding 20% year-over-year was very strong and included 16% growth in management fees. On a sequential basis, yield management fees benefited from a full quarter of Griffin fees and the expiration of a 6-month fee waiver for the non-traded credit BDC we manage, Apollo Jet Solutions. ADS contributed an incremental $5.5 million to each of management fees and fee-related performance fees in the third quarter. And as Scott noted, we turned on management fees for Fund X on October 1, at which point the fee base is for Fund IX step down from committed to remaining invested capital at a slightly lower fee rate. The combination of these two events will be modestly accretive to our fourth quarter equity management fees and we will benefit from higher run rate and catch-up fees with successive closes. In terms of expenses, comp and non-comp expenses increased on a sequential basis as expected, as the impact of growth in our headcount continues to run through our cost base. Overall, we have good visibility into fourth quarter results and continue to feel confident in meeting our $2.35 per share FRE target for this year. As we look to 2023, we still expect fee revenue growth of more than 20%, driven by revenue accretion from new strategic growth initiatives, robust organic inflows from our retirement services clients, fees from additional capital for Fund X and continued progress in our capital solutions build out. With our period of accelerated investment spend to support our fast growing platform behind us, we expect to generate positive operating leverage next year as we move toward our long-term FRE margin target of 60% plus by 2026. With a very strong revenue growth outlook and moderating expense growth, we are targeting FRE growth of around 25% in 2023, above our multiyear compound annual growth target of 18%. Moving to our Retirement Services segment, we generated SRE of $578 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter, which represents a net spread of 120 basis points [audio gap] as a percentage of average net investment assets. Normalizing our alternative returns to 11% and excluding certain notable items, SRE, as Marc noted, was $598 million in the third quarter, translating to a normalized net spread of 124 basis points. On a sequential quarterly basis, our normalized net spread increased 9 basis points, driven by 11 basis points of net accretion, both from higher floating rate income and higher on-the-margin purchases due to rising interest rates, partially offset by 2 basis points of higher operating expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our OpEx reflects higher costs associated with building at our platform capacity, and we view this as a reasonable run rate in the near-term. We've been a beneficiary of this rising rate environment with higher short-term interest rates generating approximately $100 million of incremental SRE from our net floating rate income in the first 9 months versus the comparable period of 2021, with $60 million of this increase or $0.10 a share in the third quarter. We expect this amount to rise further, due to the timing of rate basis resets. This dynamic as well as attractive deployment opportunities should continue benefiting the underlying profitability of our Retirement Services segment, translating to an expected normalized net spread of approximately 135 basis points in the fourth quarter. And just to underscore the strength of Athene's business, a year ago, we laid out an indication of $3.35 per share of spread-related earnings this year. We expect to report closer to $4 per share, with three benefits: higher rates on the floating rate portfolio, organic growth, exceeding our plans and a favorable investing environment. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect this favorable interest rate uplift, coupled with robust organic inflow outlook, to drive above average normalized SRE growth next year relative to our 11% multiyear compound annual growth expectation. Turning to Principal Investing. We reported PII of $50 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Realized performance fees of $93 million were light, as expected, as we are being patient in monetizing investments to help maximize return potential for the benefit of our fund investors. Lastly, our business generates a substantial amount of free cash flow, and we expect to deploy $15 billion of capital through 2026 in strategic growth investments, funding the base dividend and both growing the base dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $200 million of capital on HoldCo investments to drive future FRE growth as well as approximately $50 million on share repurchases. As a reminder, we spent $200 million on buybacks in Q2, and we would have engaged in additional share activity in Q3 if it weren't for restrictions during the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to be more active in buying back our stock, particularly in times when, in our opinion, our stock is clearly undervalued. We remain comfortable with our strong liquidity position, including a net balance sheet value at the holding company of $2.1 billion or $3.50 per share, with cash and equivalents of more than $2 billion. In closing, I'd like to reiterate a central theme of our remarks this morning. We are very well-positioned to capitalize on a growing pipeline of opportunities in this market backdrop and generate excess return for our clients. A year removed from our milestone Investor Day, we are even more confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and are diligently executing against our attractive growth plan, aimed at benefiting all our stakeholders. With that, we thank you for joining the call, and we'll open up for questions. So we were restricted. I won't go into the reasons we were restricted, but we were not able to buy back more than we did, which is a de minimis amount in the quarter. If you look at what we've done this year, we've actually spent about $1.8 billion between the dividend and strategic investments, and that included about $200 million of buyback in Q2. That's sort of a -- and we earn our way into the $15 billion of investment capacity over time. So you need to own it to spend it. As we look at our capital uses around the system, Athene is growing more rapidly than we thought. And $1 of growth in Athene is highly accretive in terms of export through FRE and SRE. And then we also believe that $1 of capital spent to buy back stock is also very accretive given our earnings expectations. So I think, Alex, you'll see us do both. It's a balance. Part of the balance is the role that beta [ph] plays as the equity [indiscernible], which is -- which provides important leverage to earnings without capital. So we will return in the early part of next year with more around what we expect the capital return plans to be. But I think you should expect us to see us do both lean into growing Athene because it's highly accretive and buy back stock. And then at the same time, we will continue to look at strategic growth alternatives around the system, including some of what we've done this year. Yes, Ben, you're exactly right on the first piece. So I think of this as sort of contractual or within our control is sort of one category. That will be more volatile. And then there's policyholder driven, which is sort of behavioral. And the policyholder driven, you should always expect that there's some amount of policyholder withdrawals and outflows. And we had a 7% annualized rate in the quarter. We had a 7% annualized rate for the last 12 months. It's in line with our plans. And policyholders access their policies to get cash for a variety of reasons, that's just part of the business. So we are not seeing any real change in that relative to history or our expectations, and that's the higher focus point. The contractual is a combination of both some particular funding agreements maturing. And we were in the market, as I mentioned, buying back funding agreements during the quarter, and that was sort of a decision that we made. So that number -- funding agreements tend to have a shorter duration to them. And so you do need to be in the market issuing funding agreements, and we will access that more fully when the market is there. But we're much less concerned about that. That's a market where we're a leader in and we've got good names and spreads. We've provided that extra disclosure on behavioral surrenders to provide more clarity and sort of comfort around that piece of the outpost."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Apologies in advance for sounding like a losing Texas football coach. I will do my best. I thought where I'd start is really to start with the macro or the market backdrop. I have a chart on my office wall that traces the movements of the S&P falling the 2008 financial crisis, and following the beginning of tightening in this round by the Fed. They are almost on top of each other. That is not to imply that we are going to have or experience the same sort of events that followed 2008, but I do believe it is important to comment on market psychology and investor sentiment. What did we expect would happen when we printed $8.1 trillion for the country? Well, exactly what should have happened, happened. Assets almost across the board elevated in price to multiples and levels we had never seen before. Risk was up, everything went up, interest rates went down. Now that we have begun tightening, we are doing nothing other than resetting to more normal levels. We act in the market backdrop is somehow that low interest rates and excess liquidity are the norm. They are not. Certainly not over my nearly 40-year career and not over any sort of long-term investment cycle. We have an entire generation of investors, investment analysts who have really grown up just seeing the market go in one direction. And we now all know it goes both ways. If I just chart what's happened so far this year, venture capital valuations are down 60%. Nasdaq down 30%, S&P down nearly 20%, Barclays AG down 17%. This is an amazing time for alts, alternatives, particularly for credit. Investors have now discovered that everything is correlated to the Fed. And they are also discovering that most, if not all, of last decades investment acumen was really nothing other than market beta and in some cases nothing other than levered market beta. Over the past decade, investors kind of got a free ride. There was not much need for alternatives as markets moved primarily in one direction. Yet, as an industry, alternatives grew tremendously. When I think about the market backdrop we are in today, alternatives should shine. After all, as an industry, we exist, because we produce excess return per unit of risk. And for the first time in a decade, investors are asking not just about the reward, but about the risk associated with investments. Alternatives offer diversification, in many instances, downside protection and an escape from correlation and indexation. That is the backdrop that I see for our industry. For us, this is a particularly good time. We did not chase a hot dot of growth at any price over the past decade. Our business continues to be guided by three fundamental principles: purchase price matters, excess return per unit of risk and aligned investing. As a result, we are on offense. Just in Q3, we deployed $37 billion, $175 billion in the last 12 months. Dry Powder now exceeds $50 billion. We excel in this kind of market. We are leaning in, we are out talking with investors and we are apologizing for nothing. By and large, we did what we were supposed to have done in a period of market access, which was avoid potholes. Scott will take you through some detail of our activity across yield hybrid and equity, and in particular, how active we were in the U.K as a result of LDI, which is the first I believe of many market hiccups. The proof ultimately of the strength of a franchise shows up in the numbers. As Noah already mentioned, record FRE of 365, up 14% year-over-year, record Apollo capital solutions revenues north of $100 million, as Martin will take you through. record normalized SRE of nearly $600 million, as Martin will take you through again. $100 billion of year-to-date inflows, well exceeding the $80 billion target that we put out for all of 2022 at our Investor Day last year. In terms of performance, top tier investment performance. Fund IX gross and net were 40 and 26. Direct origination strategies were up 10% year-to-date. Our Athene alternatives portfolio was up 8% in Q3. First of nearly 21% down for the S&P 500. Let me now back up a little bit and talk about the each of the individual businesses. Retirement Services is generating more volume and higher spreads. Consumers prefer 4% and 5% guaranteed yields versus 2% and 3% guaranteed yields. We have nearly $37 billion of year to date inflows. We expect to exceed $45 billion during fiscal '22. And it would not surprise me if we got really close to $50 billion. The momentum in the business is overwhelming. Not only is the business good, we are underwriting new business at really nice spreads. Whereas we used to underwrite around 100 to 110, 115 basis points, we were 130 basis points in Q3 and I expect the basis point spread to increase going into Q4. In addition, we are experiencing increasing profitability from our net floating rate position of $30 billion. This is a strategic portfolio for us. The decision and the willingness to hold $30 billion of floating rate securities means that we have foregone income that we could have maximized in prior periods in order to set ourselves up with this form of downside protection. This notion of downside protection and not being a \"current period earnings maximizer\" is what allows us to be on offense in markets like this. Martin will take you through the direct effects of being along $30 billion floaters in a highly increasing rate environment. The other nice thing about what's happening in the business is on average, the credit quality of the portfolio is going up market. We have been able to earn these spreads, taking less risk rather than more risk. We've seen minimal impact of capital on capital from ratings migration. 95% of the fixed income assets continue to be investment grade. And having excess capital which again is a luxury in our industry, allows us to be opportunistic and on offense. Let me move from Retirement Services to Apollo Asset Management. Simply said, we are on track to exceed targets from last year's Investor Day. Martin will also give you some insight to what we expect for 2023. And as you recall, we made three key bets, which were driving our Asset Management business forward. One was global wealth, AUM at the end of 5 years of $50 million. The second was Apollo Capital Solutions revenue in excess of $500 million, again at the end of 5 years, and origination volume of $150 billion annually. Let me review each of those three bets. But if you intend to tune us out, the shorthand is we're well ahead on all of those three bets. In global wealth, this market is actually showing FAs and it's showing clients that the 60-40 portfolio is not relevant anymore. I expect and our team expects that 50% of a high net worth individuals portfolio over the next 5 to 10 years will be alternative. It will not be alternative in the narrow depth definition of private equity or hedge funds. It will be alternative in the way that we mean alternative, which is an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. In this kind of volatile market where people are focused on risk reward, we are increasing mindshare as an aligned partner. If you look back and you think about what's transpired so far this year, Global Wealth AUM is up $17 billion, $8 billion from Griffin, $5.5 billion from ADS and $3.5 billion from other fundraising initiatives. $17 billion is great progress on the way to a 5-year goal. $50 billion which I fully expect that we will exceed. Our positioning in this market is not to be the largest. Our positioning in this market is to be the most innovative, known for purchase price matters, excess return per unit of risk and aligned investing. The same bargain that we have with our institutional clients is the bargain we intend to strike with our high net worth clients. AAA which I discussed in our last conference call, which is our core equity replacement product. Think of this as an alternative to S&P 500 exposure. We're already seeing great early tractions. We've been approved by three bank platforms, were we expect to launch the end of this year, the beginning of next year, and we see tremendous interest from RIA's family offices and IBDs. We have already seen as I detailed on our last call, significant corporate interest. And just to give you a sense, this portfolio is up on an annualized basis, more than 10% against the backdrop of a pretty negative S&P 500. We have been positive in all three quarters in 2022. This is what we are trying to do is to replicate S&P 500 returns plus a little, yet with fixed income like volatility. On ADS, our Apollo Debt Solutions vehicle, we were up 2.2% in the quarter, outperforming investment grade bonds, high yield bonds and levered loans. 90% of our portfolio has been put to work in 2022. Very little of the portfolio is exposed to the \"hot dot period of 2020 to 2021\". We are on offense in this vehicle. The same way we are on offense across our business. 99% of this portfolio is first-lien, which we continue to believe for high net worth investors and others is the right place to be in an uncertain market with uncertain government backdrop, with uncertain inflation expectations. Uncertainty is not a time not to invest. Uncertainty is a time to make sure you are getting paid and going in with your eyes wide open as to a range of outcomes. Furthering Global Wealth, we are seeing continued expansion and you will see us in coming quarters discuss with you what we're doing in Asia Pacific. But suffice it to say not only are we hiring, but we are seeing good leverage out of our FWD Insurance and Challenger relationships in Australia. FWD Hong Kong, Asia and Challenger in Australia, where we own majority stakes in both. To get from where we are to where we think this market is going to be, is going to require time and education. We view ourselves as innovators in this market. For those who are interested to see what we're doing, just log on to Apollo Academy. It is a powerful tool for us to engage audiences, allow FAs to earn continuing education credits, and to bring thought leadership and expand the knowledge of what an alternative is to the investing public. The early engagement is really strong. And we continue to receive accolades from our channel partners for all that we are doing to move this market along. Apollo Capital Solutions, I'll just spend a second on. As an aligned investor, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. That means we are ideally situated to work with our investors to syndicate into sidecars, into managed accounts and other flexible vehicles. Revenue this quarter was very strong. It had a goal of $500 million of revenue by 2026. It will likely be north of $400 million of revenue for 2022. I'm very optimistic, just like with Global Wealth, where we like -- I think we're likely to exceed our $50 billion AUM target, we are likely to exceed our $500 million revenue target for Apollo Capital Solutions. Somehow I get the sense that the leaders of these teams have sand backed us, but that's all good. Our job is to execute our plan not to chase the hot dot of growth. Let me now turn to the third and perhaps most important of our key bets, origination. If you run a business that is focused on excess return per unit of risk, you do not focus on growing AUM. You focus on growing your capacity to create investments that provide excess return per unit of risk. And you believe as we have seen that AUM will follow. That is how in my opinion, one generates a recurring revenue, long-term lasting franchise that investors can trust. Much of what we do in origination, as you will recall, is what we call fixed income replacement. Most of this is investment grade. We are occupying a slightly different space than most of our alternative peers. And we're occupying it because we think this is the most attractive space and we are advantaged in this particular area and we are at scale. Currently, we own or operate 13 different platforms. A platform to us is a way of generating the kinds of investment grade yield the assets that we require to consistently grow our business to feed our growing retirement services and third-party credit mandates. During the quarter, we announced the signing of a framework agreement for the Credit Suisse SPG business. This would be our 14th platform. We believe that asset-backed origination has the potential to be as large market as corporate credit. This is a product set that is primarily investment grade that fits extraordinarily well into our requirements for both our retirement services business, and the third-party business we are building. It would give us extra access to flow from more than 200 direct clients and accounts. Should we close on this transaction, which we believe we will, this would allow us to be marginally accretive going into 2023, but strategically very accretive. It will be up to us to turn this into a huge success. So we are optimistic about what this business can be in our hands, and are incredibly enthusiastic of moving to a quick closing on this transaction. Having gone through the business, let me now talk a little bit about what we're trying to build and remind how we differentiate from most other firms in the alternatives industry. Our business model is built for the long-term. The vast majority of our capital comes from our yield business and the vast majority of our yield business is fixed income replacement. Fixed income replacement is top of the capital structure, senior secured. And that's where we want to be in uncertain times. It's why we can play offense. That does not mean we are not interested in the below investment grade market or direct origination, we are. It is just not the lion's share of our business. I step back and think about again our industry. Indexation is ramping across fixed income markets and equity markets and indexation and correlation, its cousin, are just a huge source of differentiation for us as an alternative manager, the shift from defined benefit, defined contribution, is another huge source of growth. Demographics, another huge source of growth. And something not fully appreciated is the changing role of banks post Dodd-Frank. Many of the fixed income originating assets are the kinds of assets that in prior periods might have ended up on bank balance sheets. Securitization is now how American banks. We estimate and less than 20% of debt capital to U.S businesses and consumers is provided directly by the banking system. The vast majority of capital is provided by all of you through in intermediaries like us and our peers. This does not mean we are replacing the banks. Quite frankly, we are now partners with the banks. If you think about what a bank wants, for the most part, a bank wants the client. They can sell the client payments and FX, hedging, and M&A, and equity and a whole range of services that we and our peers are not really equipped, nor do I believe we will be equipped to offer. What we want is the asset. We want the asset on good terms without fees taken out in advance, where we can have a direct look to credit quality, credit underwriting to control the documentation pen [ph]. Fixed income replacement, I believe to be a vast market, where we are still in early stages of its development. And I'm confident that we can as a firm adhere to excess return per unit of risk, while growing our business. That is the challenge that I see. There is growth everywhere in the alternatives marketplace. The key is to grow while maintaining the core tenant of what an alternative is. Let me close by saying we're on offense. The year ago, almost to the day we laid out a 5-year plan, I'm confident that we're going to meet our targets which were more than doubling of earnings by 2026. The three key bets are well underway. And we have already identified the next level of growth initiatives, whether it's AAA, GPLP solutions and more to come. The accelerated hiring of the past few years is now behind us. And now it is our job to focus on simplification. The entire alternatives industry has gone from a small industry to a relatively large industry over a decade. Much of the industry has grown by adding people. We now as an industry and as a firm, we need to take time to make sure we are building the systems and operating procedures that will allow us to scale the business and return to operating leverage. Make no mistake, a return to operating leverage is in the cards, and we expect that to happen for us as early as 2023. The talent we've added most recently with our COO addition by Byron Vielehr and others, gives us the confidence that we are well set up to both grow and to be efficient in how we grow. Energy level at the firm is very high. So I want to use this opportunity not just to speak to all of you, but to thank the team, many of whom are listening for the tremendous work they have done so far in 2022. And with that, let me turn the call over to Scott. Why don't I start on the macro side, and then I will let Scott add some color. So if you go back to Dodd-Frank and the changes that happened in our system, beginning in 2008, one of the changes that happened was an increase in the, I will say, penalty of the cost of providing trading capital. By our estimate, we have roughly the same amount of market making capital in the system today as we had in 2008, with markets significantly larger. One of the things we are seeing across every market is a decrease in liquidity, and this is not just a structured product phenomenon, this is a treasury market. There was an article yesterday talking about that. And as I like to say to our clients, we now are in a market where there's only liquidity on the way up. There is not liquidity on the way down. The public markets are less liquid. The private markets are more liquid. And so we are seeing a gradual trend toward increased private liquidity, decreased public liquidity. And as a result, when you have short-term capital calls or short-term phenomenon, you end up with all manner of market-based kind of illiquidity, particularly when everyone is looking for the same door at the same time. You have to, again, propitiate [ph]. We've lived in 10 years of benign environment, with increasing liquidity and low rates. And this mismatch of daily liquid products, with non-daily liquid assets, is across our financial system. We saw it in March of 2020, in the beginning of the pandemic, where it happened in open enter mutual funds and ETFs. We've now seen it in LDI. And we will continue to see that because I step back again to the macro. Our system is designed today such that things are only liquid on the way up there, not liquid on the way down. And if you have any sort of event where investors all run for the same door, at the same time, there is no longer the dealer capital in the system to serve as a buffer to allow for usual business as usual price expectations. To be willing, to be able to participate in that market, you have to have not done something over the past 10 years. You have to have not fully invested your balance sheet, fully deployed your capital, try to maximize your earnings in a period that was very easy to try and do that. And so what you find is many investors, many institutions today, are offsite. They are essentially fully deployed. I think about the insurance industry and the publicly traded insurers over the past decade. U.S. and Europe have raised closer to 0 than $1 billion of capital and have paid out roughly 90% of their current market cap as dividends. That means people are not saying overexposed, but they're not in a position where they are net buyers and large size on market dislocation. We try and run our European, our U.S. business and our fund businesses, such that in the -- once a decade, once or twice a decade opportunity, we can be really large buyers of mispriced risk. And to do that, you have to be patient every day. And I come back to you with the hardest thing to do running a competitive investment firm is not to chase the hot dot, just to sit and do nothing and wait. It's Marc. I think it's too early to say what direct origination volumes would be. But I will come back to what I see as the macro opportunity, and this is how I frame the opportunity. Dodd-Frank, sufficient in the accompanying regulatory reform in Europe, shrunk the size of the banking system, made more of the banking systems products, investment products. The way I see U.S. consumers and companies banking today is through the structured products market, through people like us and like Credit Suisse. I believe that the structured product market can be the size of the corporate credit market. And for us, this is a slice of it. This is the top of the capital structure, generally AAA, AA, and it has relationships with 200 different entities. The transaction will initially -- is a vision to initially be funded by ourselves and by PIMCO. And it is our job, not just to take something that is already of size and scale, but to grow it from there. So I think it's early to predict how much origination will come out of this. But suffice it to say, it's going to be up to us to build a franchise around this and to retain the clients and the people necessary to go do that. But we are very optimistic, and we would not have leaned in with all of the resources that we did if we didn't think this was a needle mover with respect to our origination capability. So it's Marc. I will come back to you. So we launched with approximately $10 billion from Athene, $1.5 billion from SuMi TRUST and $3.5 billion of other institutional commitments. If I look at things that have come out of global wealth and retail, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it's something $200 million, $300 million. I would expect us to cross the $500 million, $600 million of new money beyond that by year-end. But we really will see -- we are now accepted for wealth distribution channels on a number of platforms, really focused on the first quarter, and I think you will see growth in '23. It is now up to us to take a product that we think makes sense and explain it to the market and prove out success. So it's now the hard work is on us. But I step back, we are offering investors side-by-side alignment with us for de minimis or no incremental fee on a fully diversified, no J-curve portfolio, where they have liquidity, 5% a quarter, and we do not. The initial conversations have been very encouraging, but it is now up to us to execute."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Apollo Global Management Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During today\u2019s discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode and following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference call will open for questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin the queue. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call; which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also, note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest of any Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Thanks operator and welcome again to our call this morning. Earlier today, we published our new earnings release and financial supplement on the Stockholders portion of our website. Additionally, for those who are able to tune-in live, we have the presentation and video replay of the Retirement Services business update we hosted in June available on our website. For the second quarter, we reported recorded quarterly fee-related earnings of $341 million or $0.57 per share and spread-related earnings of $442 million or $0.74 per share, which together totaled $783 million or a $1.30 per share. We also reported normalized SRE of $535 million or $0.89 per share which was also a record and increased 10% quarter-over-quarter. In total, we reported adjusted net income of $566 million or $0.94 per share. Joining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah, and good morning. This is among my favorite weeks. It's the week when our next class of associates join Apollo and we do our best to integrate them into our firm and our culture. And it's also a good chance for us just to step back and really synthesize for them the things that make our firm unique. And there are three that I always focus on. The first, our business, in fact, our industry, is built on the proposition of excess return per unit of risk. We're not in the AUM business. We're not in the fee business. We're in the business of providing clients excess return per unit of risk. So, long as we do that, the business will take care of itself as it has this quarter and throughout this year. The second, and it's a very different proposition than almost anyone else in our industry, we are an aligned investor. Our retirement services balance sheets through Athene, Athora are among the largest investors in each of our products, side-by-side with our third-party institutional and retail clients. Alignment is something unique in our industry and is something of great comfort to our clients, particularly during periods of market volatility. And finally, and I know it will bring a smile to people in this room and elsewhere, we do one thing really well, purchase price matters. Purchase price matters is a philosophy that starts with the protection of principal and is embedded in absolutely everything that we do. We approach our credit business, purchase price matters. We want to be top of the capital structure, senior secured. We approach our equity business in that we want to buy growth, but we don't want to pay for it. So we're prepared to work hard. The reality is purchase price matters as strategy has allowed us to play offense in every corner of our business this quarter, and it could not have been a better quarter in terms of execution and strategic progress. I'll do a quick tour of what I think were the highlights of the quarter, and then Jim and Martin will certainly add to it. As Noah stated, record FRE for the quarter, you should expect FRE to accelerate in the back half of the year and into 2023, consistent with the estimates we provided to you in our Investor Day back in October. Record SRE, particularly on a normalized basis this quarter $36 billion of inflows. The calendar was a little bit unkind to us and did not include a first close on Fund X, which would have added $13 billion to this total, but make no mistake that will show up in next year. This morning, we also announced the multibillion-dollar launch of S3, our GP and LP solutions business. We launched this quarter our first, next-generation global wealth product, Apollo aligns alternatives, which I will spend some time on throughout this call, record fees from Capital Solutions. We have a very clean book. We have zero hung deals, zero losses, and this is an amazing time to actually put on risk when everyone is retreating from risk. Let me turn to Athene for a moment. Athene averaged $900 million plus per week of inflows across all channels. Volume is interesting, but they're coming at near record spreads. Business in the second quarter produced 110 basis points of pre-tax net spread. We're able to do both the volume and the spread while actively upgrading the portfolio due to market volatility. The quarter was also incredibly important milestone. We added a Moody's rating of A1 now puts that alongside our A+ from S&P and our A+ from Fitch. Athora also had an absolutely amazing quarter. We announced a sizable transaction in Germany, which will close at some point next year, we believe. We also closed a deal in Italy this week, which will add about $5 billion of incremental fee-paying AUM. We added a new CEO, Mike Wells, Jim will touch on that. And you should expect us to do a sizable capital raise in the second half of this year, further bolstering Athora's firepower and growth. There is no entity in the European market that will have raised anywhere near what Athora has put together in terms of its capital base to become the premier consolidator in the European market. In terms of investment performance, PE outperformed the S&P 500 by 1,100 basis points in Q2 and more than 2,200 basis points year-to-date. The Athene alt return, which represents a subset of what we do, a more downside protected was plus 6% in Q2 versus minus 66% annualized for the S&P. A differentiated and downside protected portfolio is exactly what we want on a regulated balance sheet. In our yield business, directed origination strategies were very strong contributors to the quarter. And as you recall, the vast majority of what we do in yield is top of the capital structure senior secured. In markets like this, we do some of our best work and $40 billion of gross capital was deployed across our business in Q2. Turning now to the three bets, capital solutions I've already touched on, and I know Jim will go into detail. Suffice it to say, coming into the market with a very clean book without any exposure, gives us a lot of firepower at a point in time when everyone is pulling back. In origination, this is just a good time to originate assets. We originated $21 billion this quarter, $100 billion year-to-date, and we are a reliable source of financing when public markets and, in fact, private markets often do not cooperate. To give you a sense of how this is impacting some of our platforms, take our mid-cap, mid-market senior secured lending platform. For this half, there's 16% return on equity compared to low teens historically. This reflects a lot of firepower, a lot of capital, the absence of competition. We closed 17 new deals across 12 new relationships in June alone, first half origination volume, $9 billion, up 25% year-over-year. If I look at Wheels Donlen, which is our fleet leasing platform, our initial investment in Wheels Donlen was $2 billion of AUM in the first quarter of 2021, pro forma for the announced acquisition of lease plan and other growth during the year we should close the year out at more than $7 billion of AUM across this platform. Finally, our transaction to purchase Aqua, another platform focused on home improvement, particularly solar, also closed last week, business is performing well. Let me move now to global wealth. We are a scaled player in the global wealth business. We've been through with metrics over a period of time. Our brand is resonating across the global wealth platform. If I step back and think about where the industry is, we are in very, very early days. If you think about what we, as an industry, have offered the global high net worth community thus far, we've offered them REITs, BDCs and private funds, essentially the same product set we have offered for more than 20 years. Not much new has been created to this -- for this market. The growth in this market, despite the older product set has come as a result of institutional level of fees being offered to high net worth for the first time. And technology and market understanding, which have made the products more accessible, more approachable and more easily digestible by global wealth systems. We clearly will offer REITs, BDCs and private funds and have successfully been doing that across our platform. And I know Jim will touch on some of that. But our desire here is to be positioned in this market as a thought leader and as an innovator and to create products, specifically for this channel that really seek to eliminate friction points that historically have kept this channel from really embracing alternatives. This quarter, right at the end, we announced the launch of AAA, Apollo Aligned Alternatives. This is designed with the individual investor in mind. What we seek to do in AAA is to produce equity-like returns, with fixed income-like volatility. AAA represents 180 different positions, which have been put together over the past 13 years, which have a very fine track record and represent the entirety with some limited exceptions of Athene's equity accounts. Essentially, an individual investor gets to invest side-by-side with Apollo and Athene across its balance sheet in a way that is fully diversified, no J-curve, no two levels of fees, complete alignment, no capital calls. In a nuanced way, this is private, and it is equity, but it is not private equity. This is not a replication of levered buyout or a private funds. This is fundamentally a replacement for S&P core equity holdings within an investor's allocation. Something to touch on that I said last time, we view this market alternatives in a very, very broad way. We view alternatives as nothing other than an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. Historically, the alternatives universe has been looked at in the context of private equity or hedge funds. We're now in the context of REIT and BDCs. I believe, when we step back and really contemplate what we, as an industry, and we, as a firm, are capable of here, the definition and therefore, the addressable market is just much, much larger. We launched this product with $15 billion of invested or committed capital, $10 billion off the same balance sheet, $1.5 billion from Sumi Trust, which we announced at the end of July, and a sizable commitment from an Asia-based institutional investor, and a high net worth money manager. Early conversations with global wealth are very encouraging. I believe that this has the potential to be the largest fund across the Apollo platform by this time next year. But the hard work now begins for us to educate the market and really show the market how this product can be used as a core equity replacement product, forming the bedrock of a high net worth retail investors' equity portfolio in place of their S&P 500 exposure. Continuing on in Global Wealth. The acquisition of Griffin in all its various iterations is now completely closed. The integration is complete. Momentum is very positive. Solid fundraising year-to-date for our real estate interval fund, which now stands at $7 billion of AUM, we could not be more pleased with how seamless the Griffin acquisition has gone. Let me also touch on ADS, our private market BDC. Again, off to an amazing start, particularly considering the macro backdrop, almost $1 billion of inflows in Q2 against less than $2 million of redemptions. More than half the portfolio is now invested in directly originated loans as of the quarter end and the opportunity to put capital to work, where the market has taken a risk off point of view is offering us really on interesting opportunities at very nice spreads at very low LTVs. At the end of the day, this does, as I've often said, all come down to people. Nearly 100 new people joined Apollo in the second quarter, some key hires, head of family office, head of insurance, third-party insurance marketing, head of digital assets, all of whom, I believe, will be well known to you and other constituents as the months go by. These are truly outstanding people who\u2019ve seen in Apollo, what all of us see. We are at a size and scale where we are capable of doing anything, but we are small enough to still behave like entrepreneurs and to run our business around the principles of excess return per unit of risk, of aligned investing and of purchase price matters. I would expect on a go-forward basis, the pace of hiring will slow down. We are scaled. That does not mean we will not hire. We will still grow. But the vast scaling that we needed to do to accommodate our ambitious plans, which we set out at Investor Day has largely been completed. Culture for us is very important. We are an in-office culture, we are back -- those who have visited us in-person often remarked they\u2019re shock at just how active in-person our office is. As I've said to some of our competitors, there's nothing like feeding people three meals a day to get them in the office. We have, for the past decade and longer, followed purchase price matters. We did not chase the hot dot. We never forgot that the business of investing was not just about reward. It was also about risk. I believe that is being perceived by our institutional clients and by our retail clients; and we are being trusted as good and responsible stewards of capital. We completed an off-site this week. Jim, Scott, Martin, myself and others. It was about as optimistic and confident as I could convey. We fully expect that the business plan that we laid out for all of you in October of past year is well within our reach of doubling AUM, doubling earnings and generating $15 billion of cash flow over the five-year period as per our Investor Day comments. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Zelter: Thanks, Marc. Our second quarter results showcase that virtuous flywheel effect we're witnessing across our business as it relates to capital formation, debt origination and deployment. We generated very strong quarterly inflows of $36 billion, including $24 million from asset management and $12 billion from retirement services, and the quarterly total would have been nearly $50 billion if included in the recent Fund X commitments that Marc cited. Our debt origination engine continued to source attractive investments during a very volatile and uncertain time in the public markets, generating $21 billion of volume. And across the platform, gross deployment totaled $40 billion in the second quarter and $175 million over the last 12 months, which demonstrates the scale and breadth of our investing capabilities. There's a lot of great things to talk about across the firm right now, so my remarks this quarter will take you on a highlighted tour around the franchise. But first, I'll start with an important reminder. Many of you know that we have built our business to be resilient and excel in times of market dislocation. We manage long-dated and perpetual capital for our clients, we have a proven ability to find and create value, and we can diligently wait for opportune windows to monetize investments. As Marc highlighted, our approach is grounded in purchase price matters, i.e., price discipline, and the downside protection mentality that permeates everything we do. In moments like this, where levels of uncertainty are high and market volatility is elevated, we often will put significant amounts of capital to work as we did in the second quarter. We see a growing pipeline of attractive investing opportunities to deploy the $50 billion of dry powder we have across our yield, hybrid and equity investing strategies. Starting with yield, our cautious positioning at the top of the capital structure, primarily in senior secured positions has driven broad outperformance across our funds this year. Our direct origination strategy is appreciated by more than 3% in the second quarter, while corporate credit performance has held up well versus comparable benchmarks. With traditional sources of financing stepping back in mid heightened volatility, we're seeing tremendous deal flow in our pipeline of near-term demand is quite robust. As spreads have widened, we've moved up to this spectrum to generate the same attractive returns. For example, spreads on new issue large-cap private direct lending investments are now exceeding 650 basis points over SOFR. Year-to-date through July, we've committed to 11 transactions of at least $1 billion in size, demonstrating the scale and certainty we can provide our clients in turbulent periods. We've also issued nine CLOs and opportunistically purchased over $1 billion of investment-grade CLO tranches this year-to-date, for both our retirement services clients and other accounts with yields approaching 8% to 10% for AA to AAAB risk when considering original issue discounts that are infrequently available. We're also seeing tremendous opportunity for our hybrid funds as strategies that provide equity like upside with structured downside protection are becoming more and more effective. Our hybrid value franchise, in particular, proved quite resilient with our first vintage appreciating 1% in the second quarter, and we held a final close for a Cohort 5, raising approximately $2 billion of capital in just a few short months. The deployment pipeline has grown quickly as companies are seeking bespoke solutions in this environment, and we expect to have a very active second half of the year. Interestingly, the collapse of growth equity markets has created a unique financing opportunity and challenge for once highly valued companies. We are aiming to capitalize on the dislocation for providing preferred equity and creative debt structuring. This is how purchase price matters mentality approaches the growth equity market. Turning to equity. Our pipeline of investment opportunities is strong, and we expect to deploy a meaningful amount of capital from our flagship private equity funds in the coming months. We have approximately $1 billion of remaining capital in Fund IX to deploy before the fund is fully committed. In terms of successor, as of today, we have received $13 billion of commitments for Fund X representing more than half our total target of $25 billion. We are currently seeing strong support from both existing and new institutional investors, especially from outside the United States and expect to raise a record amount of capital from the growth global wealth channel. Despite the frequently discussed congestion dynamics in the market, we believe we are offering a differentiated product, and we remain confident in meeting our targets. Financially, we expect to benefit from a step up in FRE when we turn on Fund X, which we currently expect will be sometime in the fourth quarter and all capital raised subsequently, will earn catch-up management fees from the commencement date. Moving to Retirement Services business, Athene is built to withstand market disruptions and prosper through them. Like our asset management business, we are not a current period profit maximizer and instead manage Athene to possess significant capital flexibility and ample liquidity. This is exemplified by its $3.2 billion of excess equity liquidity and nearly $8 billion of cash within the portfolio at the end of the quarter. This posture allows us to be positioned offensively and defensively at the same time, and we view the current backdrop as a terrific environment for the business to grow. Athene provides customers value-generating savings product with principal protection features that have the durability to perform through stress, and we sleep well at night knowing that business is highly stable, predictable and almost entirely supported by investment-grade rated assets. Within Athene's IAG structured security allocation, you'll find the CLO portfolio, particularly resilient. For example, we believe BBB rated tranches issued today can we stand in annualized default of the underlying loan portfolio of approximately 11% for each of the five years, without being impaired. For those interested in more information, we provided an in-depth analysis on Athene\u2019s investment portfolio, including helpful insights on structured securities as part of our retirement services, business update from June that Noah mentioned. The attractiveness of Athene\u2019s product suite in a rising rate environment was also in full display in the second quarter with record quarterly inflows of $12 billion, underwritten to attractive returns. Athene\u2019s retail annuity channel benefited from higher demand with record quarterly inflows of almost $4 billion, and application submissions nearly doubling year-over-year. Second quarter activity also included a $4.3 billion pension group annuity transaction with Lockheed Martin, the largest deal of its kind in the industry so far this year, and we see a strong pipeline for that channel heading into the back of the year. Clearly, Athene's earnings power is growing in the current environment, and its balance sheet is not exhibiting any signs of stress from undue credit risk or unexpected withdrawals. There have been a couple of recent updates on \u2013 at Athora, our retirement services business in Europe. And in July, Athora announced that the appointment of Mike Wells as group Chief Executive Officer, subject to regulatory approval. Mike is a well-respected seasoned leader within the industry, most recently serving as a CEO of Prudential Plc. Also in July, Athora announced a transaction with AXA Germany and expect to close on an annuities portfolio currently now valued at $19 billion by the end of next year. This transaction adds strategic scale to Athora's German business, which is Europe's second-largest retirement services market with nearly $1.2 trillion in reserves and an actionable pipeline of sizable transactions. To assist in their continued growth ahead of the deal close Athene expects to participate as an anchor investor in an equity raise for Athora in the second half of this year. The AXA transaction and the planned deployment of the proceeds from the upcoming capital range are expected to drive meaningful AUM growth for Athora over the next couple of years. Moving to our key strategic growth initiatives, our origination ecosystem is proving increasingly valuable in a period of rising interest rates and tightened liquidity. Over the last 12 months, our origination volumes totaled $100 billion, as we laid out in Investor Day, and included a higher proportion from proprietary origination platforms in the second quarter. Within the context of market weakness and dislocation, we're taking measured steps to opportunistically grow the ecosystem in line with our longer-term goals. For example, we had recently announced the acquisition of lease plan, and subsequent combination with Wheels Donlen to create a unified fleet management platform. This is a prime example of our platform strategy, acquire expertise, bolt-on tangential capabilities, and organically built scale. Pro forma for the lease plan integration, we expect fleet platform originations to total approximately $3 billion annually. Our Capital Solutions business, or ACS, had an outstanding quarter with record quarterly transaction fees of $103 million, showcasing our ability to step in with private capital when other sources of liquidity dry up. The full alignment we share with our Retirement Services balance sheet, augmented by our strategic partner, Mubadala, is proving to be a meaningful differentiator or financing counterparties since we can execute more transactions with greater scale uncertainty than ever before. Our value-add in this environment is resonating with third-party clients who want to own pieces of what we do side-by-side with us through managed accounts or syndication. One of our recent signature ACS transaction was a $2 billion financing for New Fortress Energy to form a liquefied natural gas maritime infrastructure platform. Over the last 24 months, we have grown our partnership in New Fortress from an initial $800 million loan into a comprehensive financing partnership. The transaction initially started as an equity investment from several pools of capital within our broader sustainable investing effort. But when third-party financing markets shut, we pivoted internally and provided $1.5 billion of debt financing via our ACS platform. When most capital market participants would have stepped away, we were able to complete our first ever fully financed debt and equity transaction in a one-stop solution, while providing flexible scale capital with certainty of execution. As you heard us talk about before -- we are actively working to bring yield, hybrid and retirement services capabilities in new geographies. We took an important step in the second quarter and announced the launch of our new Asia Pacific credit strategy with $1.25 billion in assets, including a $500 million anchor investment from Hostplus a large superannuation fund in Australia. This commitment reflects the growing demand in the region for capital solutions from non-bank lenders with local expertise and origination capabilities. Earlier, market on a couple of newer product creation within our global wealth platform, but we've also taken an important step within our existing product suite to help further democratization of finance. Earlier this week, we announced transformative changes to accelerate the transition of our publicly traded BDC, Apollo Investment Corp. into a pure-play senior secured middle-market BDC by an equity investment for MidCap, our largest origination platform. We view this change as a unique opportunity for individual investors to participate side by side we're the largest institutional investors in the world. To enable this shift in strategy, we're reducing fees for the BDC to industry-leading levels effective January 1, 2023. We -- the portfolio transition and rebranding are now taking place, and we are excited about the future of this vehicle alongside our broader global wealth platform. As content sometimes speaking about last quarter, we're seeking compelling growth opportunities in areas of white space that are tangential to some of our strongest and largest businesses. Earlier this morning, we announced a cornerstone commitment from a long-time strategic partner, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority or ADIA as part of a broad $4 billion of new commitments to launch a platform dedicated to GP and LP solutions, which we're calling sponsor and secondary solutions or short as three. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of secondary and fund finance capital solutions, including private equity, credit and real asset secondary investments, net asset value loans, GP lending, staking and much more. We've already been active in this space having committed or deployed more than $13 billion of capital to transactions of this nature over the last 12 months, and we think we're uniquely positioned to grow the business over the long term. Now, all the exciting developments I just walked through was just a highlight to work, which should indicate that we are busier than ever and see immense opportunity for the Apollo franchise to thrive in this market. I'll pause there and hand it over to Martin to discuss our financial results.\nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Echoing Mark and Jim sentiment, second quarter results highlight the resiliency of our earnings power in a period of heightened market dislocation and volatility. Before diving into the details of the quarter, I'd like to offer a few contextual points around this theme of earnings resiliency. First, our fee-related earnings continue to be driven primarily by management fees earned, as the investment manager for our suite of investment strategies and perpetual capital vehicles. Year-to-date, nearly 85% of our fee-related revenue was comprised of management fees, while only 2% was comprised of more volatile fee-related performance fees. We have de minimis sensitivity to changes in interest rates or spreads, which we've previously highlighted. In a quarter, where equity markets declined by 16%, treasury sold off by 12% and spreads widened, we experienced only an approximate 1% drag on our management fees from market-driven declines. And despite investments that we've been making around the platform in preparation for our next leg of multiyear growth, we're doing so in a margin-conscious way and maintaining a high level of efficiency with an FRE margin level above the peer average. Next, our spread-related earnings are highly durable and possess all weather characteristics since they are largely generated by the performance of hold-to-maturity, investment-grade, fixed income assets, exceeding a predictable and persistent cost of funds, a simple financial model with massive strategic benefit. Over the past eight years, SRE has had a 90% correlation with FRE and historical credit losses have been below industry average, amounting to single-digit basis points per annum. Furthermore, the amount of Athene capital supporting SRE generation will decline over time, due to the increasing usage of third-party CCAR capital via ADAV [ph] given the attractiveness of this earnings profile to sophisticated institutional investors. Given all these factors, it's clear that spread-related earnings are both highly resilient and highly attractive. Turning now to results for the quarter. Total AUM reached a new record of $515 billion at the end of June, increasing 9% year-over-year, driven by robust inflows from both asset management and retirement services. Sequentially, AUM increased modestly as strong inflows of $36 billion were offset by $16 billion of unrealized mark-to-market depreciation, $11 billion of which related to Athora as well as $8 billion of normal course outflows from Athene and Athora as well as $7 billion of realizations. Our fee-generating AUM, which is less sensitive to changes in market values increased by $5 billion on a sequential basis. Importantly, Athene and Athora are spread-based businesses with duration matched assets and liabilities, and therefore, higher rates or wider spreads do not negatively impact profitability, but instead temporarily reduce AUM. Inflows from our asset management business totaled $24 billion in the second quarter and included $8 billion of financing across several strategies such as credit strategies, Accord V, Accord Plus, total return and several yield managed accounts as well as some of our newer funds, namely AAA and Asia Pacific credit. We also added $8 billion of yield AUM and $6.5 billion of yield fee-generating AUM from our acquisition of Griffin Capital's U.S. management business, which closed in early May. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect AUM will benefit from approximately $20 billion of identified inflows before consideration of organic growth from Athene and other asset management fund raising. We expect these identified inflows to include initial commitments for Fund X, additional third-party commitments for AAA and a sizable seed investment from Idea for our S3 platform launch, which Jim just mentioned. Second quarter FRE totaled $341 million or $0.57 per share, increasing 7% year-over-year. Fee-related revenues increased 14% year-over-year, demonstrating solid growth despite market weakness. Management fees totaled $522 million and included $16 million of fees from the acquisition of Griffin Capital. As Jim noted, transaction fees reached a new quarterly record of $103 million in the second quarter. Compensation and non-compensation expenses increased sequentially as the impact of the Griffin acquisition and a higher firm headcount continues to flow through our run rate cost base. Entering the back half of the year, we have a visible pipeline of fee-related revenue growth driven by increasing management fees, including the commencement of Fund X sometime in the fourth quarter, as well as stronger transaction fees expected in the second half relative to the first half from our ACS business. We also expect expenses in the second half of the year to continue to increase as we near the end of our accelerated growth phase. We're highly confident in meeting our $2.35 per share FRE guidance for 2022, as we initially outlined at our Investor Day, and which included lower growth in the first half of 2022 and higher growth in the second half. Looking to 2023, we expect fee-related revenue growth to exceed 20% due to broad-based momentum across our established businesses as well as traction in newer growth initiatives at both Mark and Jim outlined, coupled with operating leverage improvements as the pace of investment spend and hiring normalizes. Moving to our Retirement Services segment, we generated SRE of $442 million or $0.74 per share in the second quarter, which represents a net spread of 95 basis points as a percent of average net invested assets. Normalizing our alternative returns to 11% as we did in the first quarter by normalizing down to 11%, and excluding certain notable items, SRE was $535 million in the second quarter, equivalent to a normalized net spread of 115 basis points. On a sequential basis, our normalized net spread increased by 7 basis points, primarily from higher net floating rate income. As we've discussed before, this earnings accretion from rising rates demonstrates the counter cyclicality of Athene's business model, and we expect the benefit of higher rates to continue to ramp through SRE. Athene's alternatives portfolio generated a 6% annualized return in the second quarter, which was very resilient in light of a 66% annualized decline in the S&P 500 and an 11% annualized return in the first half of the year, in line with our normalized return assumption. Athene's alternatives portfolio is highly diversified and constructed to generate equity-like returns with significant downside protection. About half of the portfolio is invested in Apollo and other fund investments, which have a 10% annualized return in the second quarter. This strength was primarily from Athene's investments in real estate that benefited from cash flow-related property-specific updates. Specific -- sorry, strategic origination platforms, which comprise about a quarter of Athene's portfolio returned 7% in the quarter as several of our investments continue to perform well given the contractual and predictable nature of the underlying assets. The remaining portion of the alternative portfolio contains strategic retirement services investments, which had a 3% annualized return despite drag from one public position. Retirement services industry observers are generally aware of an accounting policy change through this approaching next year called Long-Duration Targeted Improvement or LDTI. While other companies may experience significant impacts to their balance sheets with the implementation of LDTI, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our results or capital levels given recent purchase GAAP accounting adjustments made in conjunction with the Athene merger close. Turning to principal investing, we reported PII of $20 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. We recognized realized performance fees of $151 million. For the first half of the year, our PII comp ratio equaled 57% and is trending towards our long-term target of between 60% and 70%. Given continued weakness in the public markets, we expect monetization activity will remain light in the back half of the year, which will likely result in PII for 2022, below our target of $1 a share on average over the. We're using our overall strong cash flow generation to capitalize on the current equity market dislocation. As part of our five-year plan, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital to use for shareholder value creation, including $5 billion to fund the base dividend, $5 billion for strategic growth investments, and $5 billion for dividend growth and opportunistic buybacks. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $230 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares from our opportunistic share purchase reauthorization. This repurchase activity served to offset the 3.9 million of shares issued related to our acquisition of Griffin Capital. We will continue to evaluate the benefit between allocating capital towards opportunistic buybacks and long-term investments in view of our share price. We feel very comfortable with our liquidity position in this macro backdrop. At the end of the quarter, our net balance sheet value was $2.1 billion or approximately $3.50 per share, which included cash and equivalents of $2 billion. Our financial strength was further validated by third-party rating agencies over the past few months. In May, Fitch upgraded Athene's ratings from A to A+, reflecting a vote of confidence in our earnings outlook and capital strength. And in July, Moody's assigned strong first-time investment-grade ratings to both sides of the business, A1 for Athene's insurance subsidiaries and A2 for Apollo Asset Management. Within their assessment, Moody cited Athene's strong market positioning and capital levels as well as the scale, breadth, and performance of our asset management business. We view these assessments as an important third-party validation of the financial strength of the combined franchise and the enhanced financial flexibility we possess together. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: We're interested in the AAA product. I wonder if I could ask a couple of quick follow-ups on fee structure, liquidity and K1 1089. And then how the securities put over -- at what marks is there a third party involved? Just curious on all that. Thanks so much.\nMarc Rowan: Glenn, thank you. It's Marc. I will be somewhat circumstant to what I can say, because we're not -- this is not a marketing of AAA. But suffice it to say, that essentially what investors are being allowed to do is to invest side-by-side with a roughly $10 billion portfolio of 180 different investments that have been curated specifically for Athene over the past 12 to 13 years. In terms of porting them over and the valuation, Athene has produced audited financials and NAV for as long as we've been having these conversations. And in fact, there are visible marks in every quarter. And so, you should assume that everything was ported over at NAV. In terms of liquidity, for Athene and for institutional investors, they are coming in, and they are essentially not -- they're agreeing not to take liquidity for up to five years. For Athene, as you know, we expect Athene's participation in this to go from roughly $10 billion to $20 billion over the next five years, just based on the forecast of Athene provided at Investor Day. For investors who want more liquidity, there is a slightly higher fee structure and liquidity is limited to 5% per quarter at NAV across the vehicle. Keep in mind that this is a replacement for equity rather than private equity. It has the characteristics on the benchmark, it's benchmarking against the S&P, with historical volatility level more consistent with fixed income. So hopefully, that met -- answered all your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Bailey: Actually, Ryan Bailey on for Alex. So regarding the $13 billion that was committed to Fund X, you're expecting record contribution from the global wealth channel. Can you help us think through how much of that $13 billion was reserved for distribution partners? And does it reserve mean the same thing as a typical commitment? And maybe if you could just -- if you could give us some color on who are those distribution partners were sort of categorically that would be very helpful, too, please.\nMarc Rowan: Well, let me just say that the vast, vast majority is the institutional channel, which we know and which historically been part of us, a non-material amount was the non-traditional institutional channel or the global wealth channels. There's four parts to that. But historically, whenever we've gone out to the global wealth channel, they've all come back with commitments well in excess of their allocation. So the big picture is really $13 billion. The big picture is really the institutional business has driven us. Now certainly, as we talk about Global Wealth playing a larger part of our fundraising from 5% to a larger portion over time, this they are participating in Fund X, but it's really an institutional story like it always has been.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from BofA.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. My first one is on cash flow. I'm curious how much capital did you dividend up to Apollo from this three at the insurance entities in relative to the $442 million of spread-related earnings?\nMartin Kelly: Hi Craig, it's Martin. So we're using the same frame that we outlined last year, which is $750 million per year. So we're just clipping away that each quarter, Athene is clearly very profitable in generating cash flow, but it's also growing significantly. And so we would expect that level of cash flow upstreaming to continue at current levels. And we'll evaluate that from time to time. But Athene has massive growth opportunities in front of us, and that's contributed to the $24 billion of inflows so far this year.\nMarc Rowan: Craig, assume it's just evenly over four quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Good morning. Thanks. My question is on capital. I guess, Marc, do you still view the stock as the best use of capital here and through that lens as 2Q? Is the 2Q run rate a good guide for what you can do per quarter as long as the price is slow?\nMarc Rowan: Look, we -- I don't want to think we're unique. Every management team thinks their stock is undervalued. We particularly think our stock is undervalued, and we had the flexibility this quarter to buy it back, and we did. As I've said previously, one needs to earn the money to spend before you get to spend it. So we have a framework that we think about in terms of capital allocation, which Martin went through, which is roughly $5 billion for the existing dividend, $5 billion allocated to growth and $5 billion, which we have the potential to be flexible on. And clearly, at these current levels, as there's no lack of unanimity in the room, our stock is the best place for that capital.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: I have a bunch of questions on Triple A. I'll just limit it to a couple for now and get back in the queue if they're not answered subsequently. But maybe just -- to be clear on the investment strategy for this, is this very similar to the Athene portfolio that you profile on page 16, so kind of targeting, say, 11% normalized return, and then maybe any commentary on how -- if that's not the case, how this might be managed differently, such as like having a dynamic allocation feature? And then if you're able to talk about the performance fee structure at all in terms of just how we should be thinking about if this grows like you say, Marc to be the biggest fund, how it could be adding to performance fee related fees. And I imagine it's very different for the institutional classes versus the retail classes?\nMarc Rowan: Let me start in reverse. It's not very different. What's interesting here is our approach to this. This is a fund that we started down the road to create for high net worth. And the concept here was to really do something that the market had never seen before. No capital calls, no J curve, $10 billion of aligned capital, some liquidity for high net worth, no liquidity for institutions, no two layers of fees. Athene as a large institutional investor, you should assume strikes the hardest bargain and is generally the lowest fee payer. So we start with the notion that we should not charge fees on top of that. And that the investor should have the single best experience. The way that manifests itself in terms of positivity for our business is, we had $10 billion of capital that is now $15 billion of capital, which is accelerating our investments in platforms accelerating our investments in co-invest, accelerating our investments in new funds. And the underlying economics are simply passed through. It's a flywheel. This is how we scale our business. What was interesting? Although we've done a product for retail, along the way to the retail launch, three very large institutions thus far, have concluded, that this actually meets all of their needs. Diversification by vintage and by product, and no capital calls, no two levels of fees. And so we are fortunate to be able to launch the product with $15 billion of commitments, 10 million in-house and five from three large institutional investors. I'm very optimistic as to how this goes. But like every retail product, it's now up to us to implement and to prove success. I also like that our benchmark here is not private equity. Private equity, as I've said previously, is a fabulous business, but it is not infinitely scalable. What I like about this, is we have lots of opportunities to scale it, because the return targets while I'm not advertising are much more consistent with premiums to S&P 500 and premiums to where we have assumed a normalized rate of return rather than something that begins with a two-handle or high-teens. So hopefully, that's sufficient.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone from Bank of Montreal.\nRufus Hone: Oh hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the Global Wealth business, and I appreciate your comments on AAA, but -- you've talked about one to two new products per quarter for several quarters. And I was curious how does that pipeline look? And what products are you particularly excited about beyond AAA? Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Sure. Thanks for the question. So when we were in Investor Day last year, we really talked about having -- we talked about products really in two big buckets: perpetual products and episodic products. And at that period of time, we arguably had three to four products, one in the perpetual area, Apollo Debt Solutions and a couple more in the episodic. Turning the clock forward to 2020 where we are right now. We really have almost nine products in the perpetual, probably a handful more in the perpetual trade. People also may recall that when we did the Griffin transaction, we inherited a couple of vehicles. So really, the product set is growing. It's fraud. We're making sure there's a theme here that that Mark has mentioned we want to obviously execute on what has been proven to garner demand, some yield in BAC [ph] and re-products, but we have a variety of a broader approach that we're bringing, so Very, very happy with not only the feet on the ground in wholesaling and product creation and selling agreements. But the product set is really\u2026\nRufus Hone: Investors think about the investment, maybe what it competes with as an asset class? And is there any sensitivity there to credit spreads moving in and out?\nMarc Rowan: Again, it's Marc. I'll start at the rest. The answer is no. We run a matched book and we offset the liabilities that we take on in the retirement services business with fixed income at roughly the same time we take them on. Changes in credit spreads do not matter. The initial ADP [ph] was for $3.25 billion. ADP has performed extraordinarily well.  As I sometimes joke with some of you, those in particular, who have had a more negative view of retirement services. It's such a negative business that investors compete and pay us fees to be able to invest in retirement services. We expect to go out and raise a successor to ADP fees and where ADP won based on the success and performance of ADP-1, which is well ahead of the benchmark promised investors and would expect that the fund would be somewhere in the $3.5 million to $5 million range, consistent with how we see growth in the retirement services sector in the US.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'Hara from Jefferies.\nGerry O'Hara: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess with respect to the allocation to alternatives within the Athene portfolio. This is clearly proving to be a strong diversified return stream. So curious if there's any consideration of increasing that allocation? And then I suppose on a related basis, is there any concern of increased regulatory oversight as clearly some of your peers have taken a similar approach? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: So the answer is, we historically at Athene have run a 95% plus/minus fixed income book, of which better than 90% of that is investment grade. And there is no plan to deviate for that or to take increased exposure to alternative investments. In terms of regulation, retirement services is a regulated business. We have, over the past 12, 13 years, developed the expertise to operate in this business and fully expect to continue to operate in the manner and the methods by which we've operated to date. I think there has been a significant tuition paid, over a better part of a decade, which others who would like to do what we have done are going to need to pay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer.\nChris Kotowski: Mine were asked and answered. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS.\nAdam Beatty: The question, I want to ask about organic growth in Retirement Services. The business update you pointed out, the historical kind of ability and willingness to shift the emphasis among the four different channels based on prevailing conditions. So assuming your overall target is still good for this year. I'm just wondering, given the distinct backdrop that we have right now, where you're seeing opportunities and where maybe you're hanging back a little bit more? Thank you. \nMarc Rowan: Look, the two strongest channels are clearly the retail fixed annuity channel, which is going as strong as it has ever gone. I mean, I think Jim or Martin cited that applications are up 100% year-over-year. Record quarters -- record weeks almost every week. The other place we're seeing really strong growth is in pension group annuities. The tick-up in rates, the tick-up in spreads have given those entities that were close to being able to close out an older retirement plan, a greater ability to do that. And we're watching that very carefully and had a very strong first six months. We're also seeing good progress on reinsurance, particularly on the flow basis. The one engine that you would expect that is not firing is the FABN market, which is negatively impacted by higher rates and higher spreads. But there's been plenty to do. And the numbers, as you know, are well beyond the record year that we had last year and continue to be very strong, and they're actually quite strong across the industry. This has been a pretty good year for the whole sector. Although, if you don't have lots of excess capital, you're not really able to take full advantage of it\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: My follow-up was asked. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. \nNoah Gunn: Brian?\nOperator: One moment, while the participant\u2019s line loads. His line will be opened momentarily.\nNoah Gunn: We can move ahead to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nNoah Gunn: Glenn?\nOperator: Pardon me one moment, while his line loads.\nNoah Gunn: Maybe that's a good place to end it, if we're experiencing technical difficulties. On behalf of our team, I'd just like to thank everyone joining for joining this morning and for your continued interest in our business. Of course, if you -- as usual, if you have any follow-up questions on anything discussed on today's call, please feel free to reach out to us. And we, of course, look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At the end of the quarter, our net balance sheet value was $2.1 billion or approximately $3.50 per share, which included cash and equivalents of $2 billion. Our financial strength was further validated by third-party rating agencies over the past few months. In May, Fitch upgraded Athene's ratings from A to A+, reflecting a vote of confidence in our earnings outlook and capital strength. And in July, Moody's assigned strong first-time investment-grade ratings to both sides of the business, A1 for Athene's insurance subsidiaries and A2 for Apollo Asset Management. Within their assessment, Moody cited Athene's strong market positioning and capital levels as well as the scale, breadth, and performance of our asset management business. We view these assessments as an important third-party validation of the financial strength of the combined franchise and the enhanced financial flexibility we possess together. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Hi Craig, it's Martin. So we're using the same frame that we outlined last year, which is $750 million per year. So we're just clipping away that each quarter, Athene is clearly very profitable in generating cash flow, but it's also growing significantly. And so we would expect that level of cash flow upstreaming to continue at current levels. And we'll evaluate that from time to time. But Athene has massive growth opportunities in front of us, and that's contributed to the $24 billion of inflows so far this year. Sure. Thanks for the question. So when we were in Investor Day last year, we really talked about having -- we talked about products really in two big buckets: perpetual products and episodic products. And at that period of time, we arguably had three to four products, one in the perpetual area, Apollo Debt Solutions and a couple more in the episodic. Turning the clock forward to 2020 where we are right now. We really have almost nine products in the perpetual, probably a handful more in the perpetual trade. People also may recall that when we did the Griffin transaction, we inherited a couple of vehicles. So really, the product set is growing. It's fraud. We're making sure there's a theme here that that Mark has mentioned we want to obviously execute on what has been proven to garner demand, some yield in BAC [ph] and re-products, but we have a variety of a broader approach that we're bringing, so Very, very happy with not only the feet on the ground in wholesaling and product creation and selling agreements. But the product set is really\u2026"

            "content": "Thanks, Marc. Our second quarter results showcase that virtuous flywheel effect we're witnessing across our business as it relates to capital formation, debt origination and deployment. We generated very strong quarterly inflows of $36 billion, including $24 million from asset management and $12 billion from retirement services, and the quarterly total would have been nearly $50 billion if included in the recent Fund X commitments that Marc cited. Our debt origination engine continued to source attractive investments during a very volatile and uncertain time in the public markets, generating $21 billion of volume. And across the platform, gross deployment totaled $40 billion in the second quarter and $175 million over the last 12 months, which demonstrates the scale and breadth of our investing capabilities. There's a lot of great things to talk about across the firm right now, so my remarks this quarter will take you on a highlighted tour around the franchise. But first, I'll start with an important reminder. Many of you know that we have built our business to be resilient and excel in times of market dislocation. We manage long-dated and perpetual capital for our clients, we have a proven ability to find and create value, and we can diligently wait for opportune windows to monetize investments. As Marc highlighted, our approach is grounded in purchase price matters, i.e., price discipline, and the downside protection mentality that permeates everything we do. In moments like this, where levels of uncertainty are high and market volatility is elevated, we often will put significant amounts of capital to work as we did in the second quarter. We see a growing pipeline of attractive investing opportunities to deploy the $50 billion of dry powder we have across our yield, hybrid and equity investing strategies. Starting with yield, our cautious positioning at the top of the capital structure, primarily in senior secured positions has driven broad outperformance across our funds this year. Our direct origination strategy is appreciated by more than 3% in the second quarter, while corporate credit performance has held up well versus comparable benchmarks. With traditional sources of financing stepping back in mid heightened volatility, we're seeing tremendous deal flow in our pipeline of near-term demand is quite robust. As spreads have widened, we've moved up to this spectrum to generate the same attractive returns. For example, spreads on new issue large-cap private direct lending investments are now exceeding 650 basis points over SOFR. Year-to-date through July, we've committed to 11 transactions of at least $1 billion in size, demonstrating the scale and certainty we can provide our clients in turbulent periods. We've also issued nine CLOs and opportunistically purchased over $1 billion of investment-grade CLO tranches this year-to-date, for both our retirement services clients and other accounts with yields approaching 8% to 10% for AA to AAAB risk when considering original issue discounts that are infrequently available. We're also seeing tremendous opportunity for our hybrid funds as strategies that provide equity like upside with structured downside protection are becoming more and more effective. Our hybrid value franchise, in particular, proved quite resilient with our first vintage appreciating 1% in the second quarter, and we held a final close for a Cohort 5, raising approximately $2 billion of capital in just a few short months. The deployment pipeline has grown quickly as companies are seeking bespoke solutions in this environment, and we expect to have a very active second half of the year. Interestingly, the collapse of growth equity markets has created a unique financing opportunity and challenge for once highly valued companies. We are aiming to capitalize on the dislocation for providing preferred equity and creative debt structuring. This is how purchase price matters mentality approaches the growth equity market. Turning to equity. Our pipeline of investment opportunities is strong, and we expect to deploy a meaningful amount of capital from our flagship private equity funds in the coming months. We have approximately $1 billion of remaining capital in Fund IX to deploy before the fund is fully committed. In terms of successor, as of today, we have received $13 billion of commitments for Fund X representing more than half our total target of $25 billion. We are currently seeing strong support from both existing and new institutional investors, especially from outside the United States and expect to raise a record amount of capital from the growth global wealth channel. Despite the frequently discussed congestion dynamics in the market, we believe we are offering a differentiated product, and we remain confident in meeting our targets. Financially, we expect to benefit from a step up in FRE when we turn on Fund X, which we currently expect will be sometime in the fourth quarter and all capital raised subsequently, will earn catch-up management fees from the commencement date. Moving to Retirement Services business, Athene is built to withstand market disruptions and prosper through them. Like our asset management business, we are not a current period profit maximizer and instead manage Athene to possess significant capital flexibility and ample liquidity. This is exemplified by its $3.2 billion of excess equity liquidity and nearly $8 billion of cash within the portfolio at the end of the quarter. This posture allows us to be positioned offensively and defensively at the same time, and we view the current backdrop as a terrific environment for the business to grow. Athene provides customers value-generating savings product with principal protection features that have the durability to perform through stress, and we sleep well at night knowing that business is highly stable, predictable and almost entirely supported by investment-grade rated assets. Within Athene's IAG structured security allocation, you'll find the CLO portfolio, particularly resilient. For example, we believe BBB rated tranches issued today can we stand in annualized default of the underlying loan portfolio of approximately 11% for each of the five years, without being impaired. For those interested in more information, we provided an in-depth analysis on Athene\u2019s investment portfolio, including helpful insights on structured securities as part of our retirement services, business update from June that Noah mentioned. The attractiveness of Athene\u2019s product suite in a rising rate environment was also in full display in the second quarter with record quarterly inflows of $12 billion, underwritten to attractive returns. Athene\u2019s retail annuity channel benefited from higher demand with record quarterly inflows of almost $4 billion, and application submissions nearly doubling year-over-year. Second quarter activity also included a $4.3 billion pension group annuity transaction with Lockheed Martin, the largest deal of its kind in the industry so far this year, and we see a strong pipeline for that channel heading into the back of the year. Clearly, Athene's earnings power is growing in the current environment, and its balance sheet is not exhibiting any signs of stress from undue credit risk or unexpected withdrawals. There have been a couple of recent updates on \u2013 at Athora, our retirement services business in Europe. And in July, Athora announced that the appointment of Mike Wells as group Chief Executive Officer, subject to regulatory approval. Mike is a well-respected seasoned leader within the industry, most recently serving as a CEO of Prudential Plc. Also in July, Athora announced a transaction with AXA Germany and expect to close on an annuities portfolio currently now valued at $19 billion by the end of next year. This transaction adds strategic scale to Athora's German business, which is Europe's second-largest retirement services market with nearly $1.2 trillion in reserves and an actionable pipeline of sizable transactions. To assist in their continued growth ahead of the deal close Athene expects to participate as an anchor investor in an equity raise for Athora in the second half of this year. The AXA transaction and the planned deployment of the proceeds from the upcoming capital range are expected to drive meaningful AUM growth for Athora over the next couple of years. Moving to our key strategic growth initiatives, our origination ecosystem is proving increasingly valuable in a period of rising interest rates and tightened liquidity. Over the last 12 months, our origination volumes totaled $100 billion, as we laid out in Investor Day, and included a higher proportion from proprietary origination platforms in the second quarter. Within the context of market weakness and dislocation, we're taking measured steps to opportunistically grow the ecosystem in line with our longer-term goals. For example, we had recently announced the acquisition of lease plan, and subsequent combination with Wheels Donlen to create a unified fleet management platform. This is a prime example of our platform strategy, acquire expertise, bolt-on tangential capabilities, and organically built scale. Pro forma for the lease plan integration, we expect fleet platform originations to total approximately $3 billion annually. Our Capital Solutions business, or ACS, had an outstanding quarter with record quarterly transaction fees of $103 million, showcasing our ability to step in with private capital when other sources of liquidity dry up. The full alignment we share with our Retirement Services balance sheet, augmented by our strategic partner, Mubadala, is proving to be a meaningful differentiator or financing counterparties since we can execute more transactions with greater scale uncertainty than ever before. Our value-add in this environment is resonating with third-party clients who want to own pieces of what we do side-by-side with us through managed accounts or syndication. One of our recent signature ACS transaction was a $2 billion financing for New Fortress Energy to form a liquefied natural gas maritime infrastructure platform. Over the last 24 months, we have grown our partnership in New Fortress from an initial $800 million loan into a comprehensive financing partnership. The transaction initially started as an equity investment from several pools of capital within our broader sustainable investing effort. But when third-party financing markets shut, we pivoted internally and provided $1.5 billion of debt financing via our ACS platform. When most capital market participants would have stepped away, we were able to complete our first ever fully financed debt and equity transaction in a one-stop solution, while providing flexible scale capital with certainty of execution. As you heard us talk about before -- we are actively working to bring yield, hybrid and retirement services capabilities in new geographies. We took an important step in the second quarter and announced the launch of our new Asia Pacific credit strategy with $1.25 billion in assets, including a $500 million anchor investment from Hostplus a large superannuation fund in Australia. This commitment reflects the growing demand in the region for capital solutions from non-bank lenders with local expertise and origination capabilities. Earlier, market on a couple of newer product creation within our global wealth platform, but we've also taken an important step within our existing product suite to help further democratization of finance. Earlier this week, we announced transformative changes to accelerate the transition of our publicly traded BDC, Apollo Investment Corp. into a pure-play senior secured middle-market BDC by an equity investment for MidCap, our largest origination platform. We view this change as a unique opportunity for individual investors to participate side by side we're the largest institutional investors in the world. To enable this shift in strategy, we're reducing fees for the BDC to industry-leading levels effective January 1, 2023. We -- the portfolio transition and rebranding are now taking place, and we are excited about the future of this vehicle alongside our broader global wealth platform. As content sometimes speaking about last quarter, we're seeking compelling growth opportunities in areas of white space that are tangential to some of our strongest and largest businesses. Earlier this morning, we announced a cornerstone commitment from a long-time strategic partner, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority or ADIA as part of a broad $4 billion of new commitments to launch a platform dedicated to GP and LP solutions, which we're calling sponsor and secondary solutions or short as three. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of secondary and fund finance capital solutions, including private equity, credit and real asset secondary investments, net asset value loans, GP lending, staking and much more. We've already been active in this space having committed or deployed more than $13 billion of capital to transactions of this nature over the last 12 months, and we think we're uniquely positioned to grow the business over the long term. Now, all the exciting developments I just walked through was just a highlight to work, which should indicate that we are busier than ever and see immense opportunity for the Apollo franchise to thrive in this market. I'll pause there and hand it over to Martin to discuss our financial results."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah, and good morning. This is among my favorite weeks. It's the week when our next class of associates join Apollo and we do our best to integrate them into our firm and our culture. And it's also a good chance for us just to step back and really synthesize for them the things that make our firm unique. And there are three that I always focus on. The first, our business, in fact, our industry, is built on the proposition of excess return per unit of risk. We're not in the AUM business. We're not in the fee business. We're in the business of providing clients excess return per unit of risk. So, long as we do that, the business will take care of itself as it has this quarter and throughout this year. The second, and it's a very different proposition than almost anyone else in our industry, we are an aligned investor. Our retirement services balance sheets through Athene, Athora are among the largest investors in each of our products, side-by-side with our third-party institutional and retail clients. Alignment is something unique in our industry and is something of great comfort to our clients, particularly during periods of market volatility. And finally, and I know it will bring a smile to people in this room and elsewhere, we do one thing really well, purchase price matters. Purchase price matters is a philosophy that starts with the protection of principal and is embedded in absolutely everything that we do. We approach our credit business, purchase price matters. We want to be top of the capital structure, senior secured. We approach our equity business in that we want to buy growth, but we don't want to pay for it. So we're prepared to work hard. The reality is purchase price matters as strategy has allowed us to play offense in every corner of our business this quarter, and it could not have been a better quarter in terms of execution and strategic progress. I'll do a quick tour of what I think were the highlights of the quarter, and then Jim and Martin will certainly add to it. As Noah stated, record FRE for the quarter, you should expect FRE to accelerate in the back half of the year and into 2023, consistent with the estimates we provided to you in our Investor Day back in October. Record SRE, particularly on a normalized basis this quarter $36 billion of inflows. The calendar was a little bit unkind to us and did not include a first close on Fund X, which would have added $13 billion to this total, but make no mistake that will show up in next year. This morning, we also announced the multibillion-dollar launch of S3, our GP and LP solutions business. We launched this quarter our first, next-generation global wealth product, Apollo aligns alternatives, which I will spend some time on throughout this call, record fees from Capital Solutions. We have a very clean book. We have zero hung deals, zero losses, and this is an amazing time to actually put on risk when everyone is retreating from risk. Let me turn to Athene for a moment. Athene averaged $900 million plus per week of inflows across all channels. Volume is interesting, but they're coming at near record spreads. Business in the second quarter produced 110 basis points of pre-tax net spread. We're able to do both the volume and the spread while actively upgrading the portfolio due to market volatility. The quarter was also incredibly important milestone. We added a Moody's rating of A1 now puts that alongside our A+ from S&P and our A+ from Fitch. Athora also had an absolutely amazing quarter. We announced a sizable transaction in Germany, which will close at some point next year, we believe. We also closed a deal in Italy this week, which will add about $5 billion of incremental fee-paying AUM. We added a new CEO, Mike Wells, Jim will touch on that. And you should expect us to do a sizable capital raise in the second half of this year, further bolstering Athora's firepower and growth. There is no entity in the European market that will have raised anywhere near what Athora has put together in terms of its capital base to become the premier consolidator in the European market. In terms of investment performance, PE outperformed the S&P 500 by 1,100 basis points in Q2 and more than 2,200 basis points year-to-date. The Athene alt return, which represents a subset of what we do, a more downside protected was plus 6% in Q2 versus minus 66% annualized for the S&P. A differentiated and downside protected portfolio is exactly what we want on a regulated balance sheet. In our yield business, directed origination strategies were very strong contributors to the quarter. And as you recall, the vast majority of what we do in yield is top of the capital structure senior secured. In markets like this, we do some of our best work and $40 billion of gross capital was deployed across our business in Q2. Turning now to the three bets, capital solutions I've already touched on, and I know Jim will go into detail. Suffice it to say, coming into the market with a very clean book without any exposure, gives us a lot of firepower at a point in time when everyone is pulling back. In origination, this is just a good time to originate assets. We originated $21 billion this quarter, $100 billion year-to-date, and we are a reliable source of financing when public markets and, in fact, private markets often do not cooperate. To give you a sense of how this is impacting some of our platforms, take our mid-cap, mid-market senior secured lending platform. For this half, there's 16% return on equity compared to low teens historically. This reflects a lot of firepower, a lot of capital, the absence of competition. We closed 17 new deals across 12 new relationships in June alone, first half origination volume, $9 billion, up 25% year-over-year. If I look at Wheels Donlen, which is our fleet leasing platform, our initial investment in Wheels Donlen was $2 billion of AUM in the first quarter of 2021, pro forma for the announced acquisition of lease plan and other growth during the year we should close the year out at more than $7 billion of AUM across this platform. Finally, our transaction to purchase Aqua, another platform focused on home improvement, particularly solar, also closed last week, business is performing well. Let me move now to global wealth. We are a scaled player in the global wealth business. We've been through with metrics over a period of time. Our brand is resonating across the global wealth platform. If I step back and think about where the industry is, we are in very, very early days. If you think about what we, as an industry, have offered the global high net worth community thus far, we've offered them REITs, BDCs and private funds, essentially the same product set we have offered for more than 20 years. Not much new has been created to this -- for this market. The growth in this market, despite the older product set has come as a result of institutional level of fees being offered to high net worth for the first time. And technology and market understanding, which have made the products more accessible, more approachable and more easily digestible by global wealth systems. We clearly will offer REITs, BDCs and private funds and have successfully been doing that across our platform. And I know Jim will touch on some of that. But our desire here is to be positioned in this market as a thought leader and as an innovator and to create products, specifically for this channel that really seek to eliminate friction points that historically have kept this channel from really embracing alternatives. This quarter, right at the end, we announced the launch of AAA, Apollo Aligned Alternatives. This is designed with the individual investor in mind. What we seek to do in AAA is to produce equity-like returns, with fixed income-like volatility. AAA represents 180 different positions, which have been put together over the past 13 years, which have a very fine track record and represent the entirety with some limited exceptions of Athene's equity accounts. Essentially, an individual investor gets to invest side-by-side with Apollo and Athene across its balance sheet in a way that is fully diversified, no J-curve, no two levels of fees, complete alignment, no capital calls. In a nuanced way, this is private, and it is equity, but it is not private equity. This is not a replication of levered buyout or a private funds. This is fundamentally a replacement for S&P core equity holdings within an investor's allocation. Something to touch on that I said last time, we view this market alternatives in a very, very broad way. We view alternatives as nothing other than an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. Historically, the alternatives universe has been looked at in the context of private equity or hedge funds. We're now in the context of REIT and BDCs. I believe, when we step back and really contemplate what we, as an industry, and we, as a firm, are capable of here, the definition and therefore, the addressable market is just much, much larger. We launched this product with $15 billion of invested or committed capital, $10 billion off the same balance sheet, $1.5 billion from Sumi Trust, which we announced at the end of July, and a sizable commitment from an Asia-based institutional investor, and a high net worth money manager. Early conversations with global wealth are very encouraging. I believe that this has the potential to be the largest fund across the Apollo platform by this time next year. But the hard work now begins for us to educate the market and really show the market how this product can be used as a core equity replacement product, forming the bedrock of a high net worth retail investors' equity portfolio in place of their S&P 500 exposure. Continuing on in Global Wealth. The acquisition of Griffin in all its various iterations is now completely closed. The integration is complete. Momentum is very positive. Solid fundraising year-to-date for our real estate interval fund, which now stands at $7 billion of AUM, we could not be more pleased with how seamless the Griffin acquisition has gone. Let me also touch on ADS, our private market BDC. Again, off to an amazing start, particularly considering the macro backdrop, almost $1 billion of inflows in Q2 against less than $2 million of redemptions. More than half the portfolio is now invested in directly originated loans as of the quarter end and the opportunity to put capital to work, where the market has taken a risk off point of view is offering us really on interesting opportunities at very nice spreads at very low LTVs. At the end of the day, this does, as I've often said, all come down to people. Nearly 100 new people joined Apollo in the second quarter, some key hires, head of family office, head of insurance, third-party insurance marketing, head of digital assets, all of whom, I believe, will be well known to you and other constituents as the months go by. These are truly outstanding people who\u2019ve seen in Apollo, what all of us see. We are at a size and scale where we are capable of doing anything, but we are small enough to still behave like entrepreneurs and to run our business around the principles of excess return per unit of risk, of aligned investing and of purchase price matters. I would expect on a go-forward basis, the pace of hiring will slow down. We are scaled. That does not mean we will not hire. We will still grow. But the vast scaling that we needed to do to accommodate our ambitious plans, which we set out at Investor Day has largely been completed. Culture for us is very important. We are an in-office culture, we are back -- those who have visited us in-person often remarked they\u2019re shock at just how active in-person our office is. As I've said to some of our competitors, there's nothing like feeding people three meals a day to get them in the office. We have, for the past decade and longer, followed purchase price matters. We did not chase the hot dot. We never forgot that the business of investing was not just about reward. It was also about risk. I believe that is being perceived by our institutional clients and by our retail clients; and we are being trusted as good and responsible stewards of capital. We completed an off-site this week. Jim, Scott, Martin, myself and others. It was about as optimistic and confident as I could convey. We fully expect that the business plan that we laid out for all of you in October of past year is well within our reach of doubling AUM, doubling earnings and generating $15 billion of cash flow over the five-year period as per our Investor Day comments. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Glenn, thank you. It's Marc. I will be somewhat circumstant to what I can say, because we're not -- this is not a marketing of AAA. But suffice it to say, that essentially what investors are being allowed to do is to invest side-by-side with a roughly $10 billion portfolio of 180 different investments that have been curated specifically for Athene over the past 12 to 13 years. In terms of porting them over and the valuation, Athene has produced audited financials and NAV for as long as we've been having these conversations. And in fact, there are visible marks in every quarter. And so, you should assume that everything was ported over at NAV. In terms of liquidity, for Athene and for institutional investors, they are coming in, and they are essentially not -- they're agreeing not to take liquidity for up to five years. For Athene, as you know, we expect Athene's participation in this to go from roughly $10 billion to $20 billion over the next five years, just based on the forecast of Athene provided at Investor Day. For investors who want more liquidity, there is a slightly higher fee structure and liquidity is limited to 5% per quarter at NAV across the vehicle. Keep in mind that this is a replacement for equity rather than private equity. It has the characteristics on the benchmark, it's benchmarking against the S&P, with historical volatility level more consistent with fixed income. So hopefully, that met -- answered all your questions. Well, let me just say that the vast, vast majority is the institutional channel, which we know and which historically been part of us, a non-material amount was the non-traditional institutional channel or the global wealth channels. There's four parts to that. But historically, whenever we've gone out to the global wealth channel, they've all come back with commitments well in excess of their allocation. So the big picture is really $13 billion. The big picture is really the institutional business has driven us. Now certainly, as we talk about Global Wealth playing a larger part of our fundraising from 5% to a larger portion over time, this they are participating in Fund X, but it's really an institutional story like it always has been. Craig, assume it's just evenly over four quarters. Look, we -- I don't want to think we're unique. Every management team thinks their stock is undervalued. We particularly think our stock is undervalued, and we had the flexibility this quarter to buy it back, and we did. As I've said previously, one needs to earn the money to spend before you get to spend it. So we have a framework that we think about in terms of capital allocation, which Martin went through, which is roughly $5 billion for the existing dividend, $5 billion allocated to growth and $5 billion, which we have the potential to be flexible on. And clearly, at these current levels, as there's no lack of unanimity in the room, our stock is the best place for that capital. Let me start in reverse. It's not very different. What's interesting here is our approach to this. This is a fund that we started down the road to create for high net worth. And the concept here was to really do something that the market had never seen before. No capital calls, no J curve, $10 billion of aligned capital, some liquidity for high net worth, no liquidity for institutions, no two layers of fees. Athene as a large institutional investor, you should assume strikes the hardest bargain and is generally the lowest fee payer. So we start with the notion that we should not charge fees on top of that. And that the investor should have the single best experience. The way that manifests itself in terms of positivity for our business is, we had $10 billion of capital that is now $15 billion of capital, which is accelerating our investments in platforms accelerating our investments in co-invest, accelerating our investments in new funds. And the underlying economics are simply passed through. It's a flywheel. This is how we scale our business. What was interesting? Although we've done a product for retail, along the way to the retail launch, three very large institutions thus far, have concluded, that this actually meets all of their needs. Diversification by vintage and by product, and no capital calls, no two levels of fees. And so we are fortunate to be able to launch the product with $15 billion of commitments, 10 million in-house and five from three large institutional investors. I'm very optimistic as to how this goes. But like every retail product, it's now up to us to implement and to prove success. I also like that our benchmark here is not private equity. Private equity, as I've said previously, is a fabulous business, but it is not infinitely scalable. What I like about this, is we have lots of opportunities to scale it, because the return targets while I'm not advertising are much more consistent with premiums to S&P 500 and premiums to where we have assumed a normalized rate of return rather than something that begins with a two-handle or high-teens. So hopefully, that's sufficient. Again, it's Marc. I'll start at the rest. The answer is no. We run a matched book and we offset the liabilities that we take on in the retirement services business with fixed income at roughly the same time we take them on. Changes in credit spreads do not matter. The initial ADP [ph] was for $3.25 billion. ADP has performed extraordinarily well.  As I sometimes joke with some of you, those in particular, who have had a more negative view of retirement services. It's such a negative business that investors compete and pay us fees to be able to invest in retirement services. We expect to go out and raise a successor to ADP fees and where ADP won based on the success and performance of ADP-1, which is well ahead of the benchmark promised investors and would expect that the fund would be somewhere in the $3.5 million to $5 million range, consistent with how we see growth in the retirement services sector in the US. So the answer is, we historically at Athene have run a 95% plus/minus fixed income book, of which better than 90% of that is investment grade. And there is no plan to deviate for that or to take increased exposure to alternative investments. In terms of regulation, retirement services is a regulated business. We have, over the past 12, 13 years, developed the expertise to operate in this business and fully expect to continue to operate in the manner and the methods by which we've operated to date. I think there has been a significant tuition paid, over a better part of a decade, which others who would like to do what we have done are going to need to pay. Look, the two strongest channels are clearly the retail fixed annuity channel, which is going as strong as it has ever gone. I mean, I think Jim or Martin cited that applications are up 100% year-over-year. Record quarters -- record weeks almost every week. The other place we're seeing really strong growth is in pension group annuities. The tick-up in rates, the tick-up in spreads have given those entities that were close to being able to close out an older retirement plan, a greater ability to do that. And we're watching that very carefully and had a very strong first six months. We're also seeing good progress on reinsurance, particularly on the flow basis. The one engine that you would expect that is not firing is the FABN market, which is negatively impacted by higher rates and higher spreads. But there's been plenty to do. And the numbers, as you know, are well beyond the record year that we had last year and continue to be very strong, and they're actually quite strong across the industry. This has been a pretty good year for the whole sector. Although, if you don't have lots of excess capital, you're not really able to take full advantage of it"

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Apollo Global Management's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During today\u2019s discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode and following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference call will open for questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin the queue. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also, note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest of any Apollo fund.  I would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn : Thanks, operator, and welcome again to our call this morning. Earlier today we published our new earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. We will also post a financial supplement on the Athene Investor Relations website in the coming days, which provides historically disclosed information on Athene\u2019s balance sheet and investment portfolio. Additionally, we plan on publishing a new quarterly investor presentation on our website in the near future.  As you can see, our first quarter results reflect our post-merger financial construction illustrating the strong combined earnings power of Apollo and Athene. For the first quarter, we reported fee-related earnings of $310 million or $0.52 per share and spread-related earnings of $670 million or $1.12 per share. These two earnings streams combine to total $980 million in the first quarter or $1.63 per share as the business demonstrated strength and resilience amid a period of macro volatility.  We also reported normalized spread-related earnings of $488 million or $0.81 per share to provide a supplemental view of this important and valuable earnings stream. As we move into a new era of financial reporting post-merger, we noted in a recent 8-K filing that we were going to rename our primary non-GAAP metric from distributable earnings to adjusted net income.  This name convention better aligns with our dividend policy, as well as the broader financial services universe. This change had no impact on our historical financial results or construction of what has historically been DE. For the first quarter, we reported adjusted net income totaling $915 million or $1.52 per share.  Joining me this morning to discuss our strong results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. Given that we published a new package for you this morning, and our prepared remarks, they run a bit longer we will do our best to be as efficient with your time as possible and look forward to answering all your questions. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan : Thank you, Noah, and good morning to all. Needless to say we are pleased with the first quarter results. As you know, during the quarter, we completed the merger with Athene. In a period of great volatility, the merger preceded seamlessly as did the closing of the financial statements. As Noah mentioned, the first quarter results showcased the combined earnings power of the business.  The trends that we are seeing in the marketplace, specifically rates up and volatility historically have been very good for our business, particularly as it relates to spread-related earnings, which is biased to the upside with rising rates as I am sure Martin will detail in his remarks.  FRE, SRE, spread-related earnings and robust inflows position us to meet or exceed our 2022 financial targets in the aggregate, and each of the pieces. Martin again will take you through that in detail in his section. So as I\u2019d like to think about the strength of the alternatives business, the purpose of the alternatives business is to produce excess return per unit of risk.  For us, purchase price matters as an investment philosophy permeates everything we do. Pricing and valuation are important for return generation really for the first time in about 14 years. As you see in the results, our PE portfolio was up 8% versus minus 5% for the S&P 500 and minus 9% for the NASDAQ. The era of being able to achieve results on the back half of declining rates and increasing liquidity I believe to be at an end separating alpha from beta. Our approach on purchase price matters is resonating with clients in this macro backdrop. Purchase price matters is not only a tool that we think about in the equity business. As I suggested it permeates everything we do. In our hybrid business, by giving away a portion of the upside and protecting the downside, we express purchase price matters.  In our yield business, our yield business is primarily driven by senior secured, top of the capital structure, investment-grade and floating rate. Purchase price matters even in the yield business. We began 2022 with tangible progress against the three goals, three bets essentially that we\u2019ve made to power the company over the next five years. Origination, retail and capital solution. In origination, volume for Q1 was some $22 billion and runrating at a $100 billion. Recall that our five year target is to push that on a runrate basis to $150 billion.  We completed acquisitions in the quarter of PACE, Foundation and Newfi. These are platforms, platforms you should think of as permanent origination. In our industry, we spend a lot of time talking about permanent capital, permanent origination is just as important as permanent capital. We positioned ourselves as a scaled solutions provider executing deals with speed and certainty.  Two of that I\u2019d like to mention for the quarter, Aldar, a $1.4 billion commitment, it\u2019s one of the largest foreign direct investments in Abu Dhabi\u2019s private sector, investment-grade primarily; SoftBank, some $5.1 billion, investment-grade. These are the kinds of transactions in the originated marketplace that allow us to provide our balance sheet and our clients excess return per unit of risk even against the backdrop of a volatile market.  Let me turn to Capital Solutions next. Capital Solutions had a pretty good quarter even against the backdrop of market volatility. We are well positioned to deliver on the 2022 growth targets notwithstanding what\u2019s happened in the first quarter. The Q2 pipeline is incredibly strong and very encouraging.  As you know, we announced the strategic partnership with Mubadala to capitalize on these origination activities augmenting the volume of origination and syndication activity we can now execute. Again, a very good start for the year and I expect we will meet or exceed the targets we have in Capital Solutions. Again, recall, in our five year plan that we\u2019ve projected $500 million of revenues over the five year period or I should say at the end of the five year period.  Let me turn to Global Wealth. Judging by the reporting coming out of the earnings season for the alternatives peer group, what\u2019s happening in Global Wealth seems to be of interest to the analyst community and to the marketplace and it should be. We made meaningful progress against Global Wealth and our objectives in Q1.  We added 125 dedicated employees bringing our total employment in Global Wealth to a 145, I believe to be the second largest global wealth team amongst alternative peers. Team alone is going to define success. Here, the acquisition of Griffin, which will be completed in all facets in the second quarter is an incredibly exciting partnership, we\u2019re off to a very good start and we expect to see significant progress.  Apollo Debt Solutions, our private BDC continues to enjoy fundraising traction and we expect to expand and internationalize distribution over the year and the quarters as we continue to deploy and we see strong demand across a variety of wealth channels, particularly RIAs.  Let me spend a minute and talk about how we see the global wealth market. First, I think I need to backup and I need to define what we believe to be an alternative. An alternative to us is simply an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. That definition encompasses an incredibly large marketplace versus a definition historically that where alternatives have been thought of as private equity and a variety of very opportunistic products.  We like those products. Those products are the foundation of our business but the market for alternatives is broader than perhaps we even imagined. I believe you will see the global wealth market develop along two lines over the coming years, one will be against the backdrop of traditional definitions of alternatives. Think of that as private funds. Think of that as BDCs. Think of that as REITs.  In many instances, these products have been in the marketplace for decades, but for the first time are being offered to clients at its institutional fee scales and with ease of access through technologically augmented implementation and with a much better understanding at the end-client of the purpose and of the value behind these products. And needless to say, clients really like them. We\u2019ve seen tremendous take up of alternatives using that definition over the past few years. But I believe that there is a broader market. And the broader market really will help clients deal with what I would say is their traditional portfolios to the extent a high net worth client might have been following a 40-60 portfolio or a traditional, I believe that they will struggle in the coming years with volatility in rates, indexation in markets, volatility of equity to meet their retirement needs.  You will see us focus on the next generation of products later this year. We intend to launch the first of a generation of products specifically created for this marketplace. We are focused not just on alternatives but on equity replacement. I could see today in the not too distant future when a clients portfolio is not 10% or 15% alternatives, but it\u2019s 50% alternatives.  Alternatives under the definition of an alternatives to publicly traded stocks and bonds. We believe that alternatives exist from double A to equity and our job is to bring those products to market and offer clients excess return per unit of risk. Most clients can afford to take some amount of liquidity risk across their portfolio. The product set that we envision is large, and scalable and coming soon.  Culturally, this has been an amazing quarter. What we are doing, what we are saying is resonating in the professional services marketplace. This is incredibly critical to attract and retain talent. For the first quarter, we hired 185 new Apollo employees, turnover is down and satisfaction is up.  To close, the optionality in our business is huge. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress on our strategic growth initiatives in a relatively short amount of time and we have some exciting developments in capitalizing on white space opportunities in front of us.  I will now turn the call over Scott to provide you with some detail on these developments and also cover key drivers of our Q1 results. \nScott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc. Our business is built to withstand and even thrive in times of macro volatility and market disruption. This was most clearly demonstrated by our strong first quarter investment performance, which is underpinned by purchase price discipline and downside protection, as well as a focus on investments in companies with strong cash flow generation.  As Marc mentioned, our overall private equity portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by 12% in the first quarter and our long-term track record remains very strong across our flagship strategies. Fund IX appreciated 15% during the quarter, which was substantially all driven by EBITDA growth. Similarly, on a life-to-date basis, approximately 90% of the value creation achieved by Fund IX has been from EBITDA growth.  As of quarter end Fund IX\u2019s inception-to-date performance is a stellar gross IRR of 52% and 34% net showcasing the significant alpha we are capable of generating for our clients. As it relates to Fund X fundraising, we continue to feel very confident in meeting our $25 billion target.  Despite some congestion in the private equity fundraising market others have cited, as well as the impact of the denominator effect on LP appetite for additional private equity exposure, we are still seeing solid support from our existing LP base and new commitments from an array of investors including the global wealth community. We believe our differentiated strategy and strong investment performance are setting us apart in this current volatile markets backdrop.  Additionally, yield strategies held up very well during the quarter amid higher rates and wider credit spreads with direct origination and corporate credit strategies outperforming their benchmark indices by 350 basis points and 70 basis points respectively. This outperformance was driven by both higher allocations of floating rate securities, as well as superior individual credit selection.  We continue to believe the yield-oriented funds we manage are well-positioned for sustained period of higher interest rates. We apply the same discipline \u2013 excuse me, the same emphasis on price discipline downside protection and excess return generation in managing Athene\u2019s investment portfolio. Our ability to produce excess spread comes from moving out the liquidity spectrum, not taking incremental credit risk.  As evidence of our focus on underwriting and credit quality, it\u2019s worth noting that Athene\u2019s historical credit losses have only amounted to seven basis points over the last five years. Additionally, 95% of Athene\u2019s fixed income portfolio is invested in investment-grade securities. During the first quarter, we remained active in deploying Athene\u2019s balance sheet cash into attractive investments with a weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases exceeding the Triple B corporate bond index.  Recall that we benefit from a structurally low cost of funds, given that we built Athene\u2019s business during a decade of historically low rates. The assets supporting these funds are generally matched from day one allowing us to lock in attractive spreads. We\u2019ve allocated a portion of these assets to floating rate investments that will benefit from rising interest rates as Martin will discuss later.  Additionally, we\u2019ve constructed a differentiated alternatives portfolio comprising 6% of Athene\u2019s assets. In the market environment we saw in the first quarter with equity market volatility, rising rates and inflation, Athene\u2019s limited exposure to public equities and sizable allocation to strategic asset origination and retirement services platforms, as well as diversified credit, real estate and natural resource investments drove meaningful outperformance.  In particular, we expect the things investments in origination platforms to increase in value in a rising rate environment coupled with tighter liquidity conditions.  Switching to deployment, periods of dislocation and volatility also provide opportunity to put capital to work and our low cost of capital allows us the flexibility to be responsive and opportunistic in our deployment activity. With equity valuations normalizing and borrowing rates rising, we are engaging in an increasing amount of strategic dialogues with companies looking for ways to fund their growth via creative capital solutions.  We are also seeing opportunities arise from liquidity-driven dislocations, particularly in leverage finance and the convertible bond market. Total gross deployment, which is a measure of our aggregate investing activity totaled $48 billion in the first quarter, which included $6 billion from drawdown deployment. Following a quieter fourth quarter, we were active in making new commitments for Fund IX, including our pending investments in Tenneco, Novolex and Ingenico to name a few.  At the end of March, Fund IX was 90% committed or invested. We have $2 billion to $3 billion of dry powder left to deploy from Fund IX before we would need to commence the investment period for Fund X. Origination activity, as Marc mentioned represents the alpha generating investments we source across our debt business.  Strength in the first quarter origination volume was driven by more traditional origination activity such as commercial real estate debt lending and CLO debt. This was complemented by origination activity from platforms including our scale to middle market direct lending business and more recent additions such as Wheels Donlen and Newfi.  In terms of capital raising, inflows of $31 billion in the first quarter were robust and diversified bringing our total inflows over the last 12 months to $91 billion. Inflows from asset management totaling $19 billion in the first quarter included $12 billion from broad based fundraising activities in several strategies including a court 5 total return Apollo debt solutions hybrid value and our new capital markets partnership among several others.  Inflows from retirement services totaled approximately $12 billion in the first quarter, the second highest quarter of organic inflows Athene has generated to-date. The business continues to source attractive profitable growth that has the dual benefit of growing fee and spread-related earnings. It\u2019s worth highlighting that we now raised over $7 billion of AUM for high-grade alpha managed accounts.  The underlying clients of which are third-party insurance companies, which we believe validates the alpha generating strategy we employed for Athene on a day-to-day basis. Based on our strong first quarter fundraising results, we feel comfortable meeting or exceeding our previously communicated $80 billion organic inflow guidance for 2022.  Importantly, inflows from our global wealth platform accounted for more than 10% of asset management fundraising in the quarter, double our historic average. As Marc alluded to, we are building a tailored product suite across the risk reward spectrum that is purposely designed for this market and expect to launch one to two new retail products every quarter over the next 18 to 24 months.  This includes our non-traded direct real estate income vehicle, Apollo Realty Income Solutions or ARIS, which publicly filed the registration statement with the SEC in April. We are also seeing significant institutional overlap with products that were designed for the global wealth market, which we believe to drive upside to our fundraising targets this year.  As Marc mentioned, we are seeing momentum in several of our newer end scaling strategies including total return, credit secondaries, Apollo Debt Solutions, as well as our third-party insurance business. As these initiatives trend favorably, we are also continuing to invest in several growth opportunities and bring in outside talent and resources where appropriate in order to capture the white space opportunities around our core capabilities.  These adjacencies will seek to expand our product set where we believe we have a competitive edge and could drive meaningful upside to our long-term growth trajectory. During the first quarter, we announced the launch of a comprehensive sustainable investing platform focused on financing and investing in global energy transition.  We view the energy transition opportunity as a cross-platform endeavor harnessing the talent of investment professionals, not only from our equity platform but across our yield, hybrid, infrastructure and natural resource franchises.  Our platform is targeting to deploy $50 billion in clean energy and climate capital over the next five years with the opportunity to deploy over $100 billion by 2030. While these figures may seem large, it\u2019s really only a drop in the bucket. By comparison, we expect financing in the decarbonization of industry to require approximately $5 trillion per year in capital investment over the next twenty years.  To advance these goals, we are planning on raising dedicated capital vehicles. We are in the process of marketing a climate finance fund and expect to launch an energy transition equity vehicle later this year. Expanding and broadening our secondaries platform is another one of our strategic priorities given the scalability of the business and large growing opportunity set.  The ecosystem we are targeting is broad and dynamic and extends beyond the traditional definition of LP secondaries. We are building out a comprehensive toolkit including continuation vehicles, GP and fund financing, as well as credit secondaries to address the needs of this market holistically. We are focused on adding talent and scale to these newer initiatives and have recently made strategic hires with experience in the equity secondaries market to augment our existing talent and capabilities.  Given the progress we\u2019ve made so far, you\u2019ll begin to see us raising and deploying significant amounts of capital across this platform in new and non-traditional ways. In Asia, we continue to see massive untapped potential to bring our yield and hybrid strategies to this market, particularly in Japan, Australia and India.  One of our most seasoned senior colleagues is leading our expansion into Asia and we are also hiring talent on the ground. Our leadership team is increasingly engaged with insurance companies, banks and pension plans across the region who are interested in our retirement service solutions and fixed income replacement capabilities.  And lastly, as I mentioned at Investor Day, we see significant white space opportunities from bringing together the broader Apollo platform with best-in-class sector expertise in areas where we don\u2019t have a historic footprint, particularly as we enter what we expect to be a period of extended market volatility.  As always, we approach all new opportunities with a purchase price matters mentality and believe adding specialized intellectual capital across our yield, hybrid and equity strategies will bring new capabilities to the broader Apollo ecosystem.  We are beginning to partner with leading high quality companies possessing these capabilities that will be accretive across the platform. By way of example, as you saw with our investment in Motive last year, we chose to partner with them due to their FinTech expertise to explore investment opportunities and potential new capabilities that we otherwise would not have pursued.  We\u2019ve been working on a number of exciting things and expect to announce several partnerships in the coming months in areas such as life science, software and hard tech.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our financial results in detail. \nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks, Scott. Our first quarter results represent a really solid foundation for our next chapter as a large and more profitable monopoly. Following our merger with Athene, our earnings power is greatly enhanced. The durable and recurring nature of fee and spread-related earnings is a powerful and highly valuable combination that we believe will be increasingly appreciated as we execute on the interactive financial plan we presented last October.  For the first quarter, we reported fee-related earnings of $310 million or $0.52 per share, which increased modestly year-over-year reflecting higher revenues and increased cost associated with investing in our business for growth as both Marc and Scott mentioned. Importantly, fee-related revenues from professional capital represents over 50% of our total fee revenue providing enhanced durability and compounding growth potential of this viable earnings stream.  Management fees increased 11% year-over-year, driven by robust and broad based inflows from retirement services, institutional and retail clients, as well as strong deployment activity in funds that earn management fees on invested capital.  While the quarter included some catch-up fees in yield, we expect further management fee growth for our yield strategies over 2022, driven by our focus on origination of differentiated assets through our platforms. We held the final close for our Griffin acquisition last week which adds two integral funds totaling approximately $6.5 billion of fee-generating AUM.  Griffin has continued to see growth in total sales from its real estate and credit funds since the acquisition was signed last December.  First quarter advisory and transaction fees of $64 million increased 16% year-over-year, but faced some sequential pressure from low overall capital markets activity in the first quarter as Marc mentioned. Capital Solutions activity has picked up so far in the second quarter with transaction fees runrating at a higher level compared to the first quarter.  Turning to fee-related expenses, the year-over-year increase reflects our continued investment in talent and the previously communicated rebasing of our non-compensation cost structure in 2022 following the expansion of our global team and including higher occupancy and technology costs necessary to support the firm\u2019s next leg of growth.  We expect to continue growing into a higher runrate expense level, as we progress throughout the year consistent with the trends we outlined at our Investor Day. With that said, we expect to generate positive operating leverage as we enter 2023 as the pace of expense growth slows.  Moving to our retirement services segment, we generated spread-related earnings of $670 million in the first quarter or $1.12 per share, driven by a net investment spread of 186 basis points and translating to a net spread of 148 basis points. Our SRE reflects the impacts of purchase accounting whereby we were acquired to mark-to-market the assets and liabilities on Athene's balance sheet at the date of the merger close. This resulted in a rebasing of our fixed income investment yield, cost of funds, and financing costs.  The net one-time impact to our net investment spread was a two basis point benefit in the quarter. The primary driver of our particularly strong SRE results was an elevated asset yield and specifically the portion derived from alternative investment income.  94% of Athene\u2019s investment portfolio is invested in fixed income securities and our SRE includes the effective yield on these assets. The remaining at 6% of Athene\u2019s portfolio is comprised of differentiated downside protected alternative investments which are marked on a quarterly basis.  In the first quarter, income generated from these alternative investments was above the long-term trend of 12% producing an annualized return of 17%. Recall that the construction of this portfolio is strategic origination and retirement services platforms as well as Apollo\u2019s fund investments principally equity and hybrid.  Since the vast majority of this portfolio is not tied to public equities or technologies specifically, it\u2019s not surprising to see outperformance relative to the public equity markets. You can see the high level composition of the portfolio on Page 15 within our earnings presentation. Within this portfolio, performance from strategic origination platforms was particularly strong and generated 11% annualized return.  These businesses have spread-based characteristics and as Scott mentioned benefit from a rising rate environment. As we\u2019ve been emphasizing proprietary and recurring asset origination is an extremely important differentiator for us. We hold these investments in these origination vehicles through Athene, which provides a capital-efficient structure effective of earnings assets for Athene\u2019s investment portfolio and frees up capital at the holding company level for other strategic growth investments.  Strategic investments in other retirement services businesses also performed well. These are also typically spread-based businesses that generally benefit in a rising rate environment and include investments such as Athora, Venerable, Challenger and FWD. These investments generated a 17% annualized return during the first quarter.  And lastly, the performance of investments in Apollo and other managed funds was the largest source of strength generating a 19% return for the quarter. Every sub asset class component of the fund investments contributed to the result with real estate outperforming in the \u2013 amid inflationary trends and complemented by appreciation in private equity and natural resources funds.  Given the typical quarterly fluctuations in Athene\u2019s alternative returns, we also present normalized SRE assuming a constant return of 11%, slightly below Athene\u2019s long-term average of 12%. We also normalized for certain notable items generally related to adjustments to long-term liability assumptions, which can vary favorably or unfavorably from period-to-period.  We do not recognize these items as recurring income until that\u2019s clearly becoming a trend. Assuming normalized alternative returns of 11% and reducing for certain notable items, SRE would have been $488 million in the first quarter translating to a normalized net spread of 108 basis points on a net basis. As Scott mentioned, our earnings benefit from rising rates given that Athene\u2019s has invested in $37 million of floating rate securities, and only has $11 billion of floating rate liabilities.  Approximately, 60% of the net floating rate exposure is tied to three month LIBOR with the remainder split between one month and other basis. Due to the timing of resets relative to the timing of rising spot rates, we experienced only a modest earnings benefit from higher short-term rates in the first quarter. In dollar terms, we expect every 25 basis point overall shift in the curve to drive an additional $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE.  If the forward curve materializes as of April 30, we see approximately $0.30 per share of upside to SRE in 2022, specific to a benefit from higher rates.  Our retirement services business creates a locked in liability cost other than relatively small reserve adjustments for changes in expected behavior at the tail end of the contracts. For GAAP reporting, we are required to recognize the interest rate and current spread changes on assets supporting the insurance contracts that we are not committed to recognize similar changes on the associated liabilities.  Our reported GAAP loss in the first quarter was driven by interest rate driven unrealized investment losses on fixed income securities held through reinsurance. For comparability and consistency, our SRE metric adjusts for this specific treatment on reinsured assets.  Lastly moving to our principal investing segment, we\u2019ve reported principal investing income of $187 million in the first quarter or $0.31 per share. We realized performance fee generation which relatively light in the quarter in view of turbulent markets. Our current two flagship private equity funds, Funds VIII and IX remain planned to monetize the portfolios when we feel the market backdrop is opportunity to harvest.  Realized investment income included $206 million from realized gains on the transfer of the majority of Apollo\u2019s GP investments. This portfolio was transferred to Athene in the first quarter and we expect it will soon be transferred to a fund managed by Apollo including third-party capital to support fund-raising in a new strategy.  We know that we are now presenting halt curve and other financing costs as a separate line item on our income statement outside PII. We estimate that PII in 2022 will align with our multi-year forecast of approximately $1 per share on average excluding interest and financing costs over the next five years.  Now turning to capital, we spent $325 million in the quarter to repurchase shares to offset diversion with respect to employee share deliveries in line with our plan to immunize our share count from equity-based compensation.  Given the recent dislocation in our stock, we are actively evaluating opportunistic share repurchases, as part of our announced share repurchase program, while continuing to balance investing in interesting investments such would accelerate our growth profile over the long-term.  We utilized approximately $150 million of capital from the holding company on strategic investments in the first quarter primarily for our investment in case. Athene ended the quarter in a strong capital position with $7.3 billion of deployable capital including $3.3 billion of excess equity capital, $2.9 billion of untapped debt capacity, and $1.1 billion of dry powder in the paid up side curve.  At the end of the first quarter, our net balance sheet value was $2.5 billion or $4.22 per share, which included cash and equivalents of $2.2 billion. In line with our fixed dividend policy, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share in the first quarter.  So to wrap up and to echo Marc, our first quarter results set us up very well for a strong year of growth. We are excited to share the progress we continue to make executing our long-term strategic plan in the coming quarters.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. \nGlenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. I just want to touch on one of the last things you mentioned and get the big picture and just need a little more color to fully understand the big picture of what you are moving in the $5 billion from power management to Athene to funds? What is happening and what does that do for you at the highest level? \nMartin Kelly: So, hey Glenn, it\u2019s Martin. It\u2019s not $5 billion, it\u2019s much less than that. It\u2019s a portion of the existing GP investments. You will notice that the balance sheet went down significantly. Most of that drop is related to the merger.  The investment we had in Athene obviously goes away on consummation of the merger. So, what we are moving is a majority of the GP sites that we are in funds that we manage and then moving to a vehicle which we expect will occur in the second quarter to support a third-party capital-raising initiative. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Finian OShea from WFS. Your line is now open. \nFinian OShea : Hey everyone. Good morning. Can you talk a bit about how the \u2013 how rising interest rates is impacting the outlook for high-grade origination?\nMarc Rowan: Look, it\u2019s Marc, I\u2019ll start with the balance sheet and then we\u2019ll talk about origination. So, as Scott mentioned in the call, when Athene or quite frankly any other retirement services company assumes a liability, it matches it with assets and we so-called AOM matching. There is a portion of that that needs to be reinvested over a period of time representing the profit on the contract.  When people talk about AOM matching, they are talking about matching an asset and the liability, but profit to some extent is unhedged and therefore if you are putting assets on the books in a rate environment that are higher than the rate environment when you assume the liability that is generally a positive.  In addition, what we\u2019ve seen is, a benefit from floating rate. Now your specific question as it relates to origination, generally what we have seen is the \u2013 at the newly underwritten product is being underwritten in the context of higher rates and yet our funding cost on these platforms are relatively sticky, so we\u2019ve seen expanding margins across the platform.  To the extent rising rates, and just to give you a sense in the \u2013 through I guess, the last week, the investment-grade market was off 17%. It\u2019s made people gunshot and we\u2019ve seen this across most public credit markets to the extent there is dislocation in public credit markets, we are a better more secure, more definite source of capital. All of those things benefit on average we are better off with rising rates. \nScott Kleinman: Yes, I would just chime in that, yeah, as Marc said, the origination teams are as busy as they\u2019ve ever been. So, the rising rate environment, the tightening of the liquidity environment is making things even more attractive. \nMartin Kelly: Right, with further benefits that are seen with the floating rate assets and higher rates increases the origination of annuity products. So, it\u2019s a benefit around the whole system.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nAlexander Blostein : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Also maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question around just capital allocation priorities here. The stock have been under considerable pressure here relative to kind of either the insurance comps at or the asset management comps at. You guys are generating substantial amount of capital and have lots of excess capital.  I heard, both Marc and Scott talk also about different kind of new investment opportunities and I guess, sounds like acquisitions maybe on the asset management side or in the origination side. I guess, how do you weigh those inorganic opportunities against the buyback at these share prices? \nMarc Rowan: Let\u2019s do it at the highest level and just to give you \u2013 it\u2019s Marc, by the way, context from the Investor Day. We said at Investor Day that we expect to generate $15 billion of excess capital over the next five years. $5 billion to support what we\u2019ll call the base dividend, $5 billion for investment in the business and $5 billion that we would use opportunistically either to invest or for buybacks or for dividends, I think Martin said it best given where the stock is, we expect to use a portion of that to buy back stock.  The stock is very attractive from our point of view. Now, one needs to actually generate the $5 billion to be able to spend it, but one can argue that probably the highest and best use of our excess capital is our own stock. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning. This is [Indiscernible] here standing in for Michael. I just wanted to ask a quick question about \u2013 get an update on retail and get an update from the resources you are deploying in the channel and how you anticipate those results and the headcount expanding from here, maybe talk about the folks that come across from Griffins. So how to expect that to trend from here?\nScott Kleinman: Yes, sure. Look, as Marc mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ve seen over the last year headcount go from about 25 to about 145. That gives us a really strong footing for both our high net worth as well as RIA channels to be able to \u2013 to support that, as well as the product development capabilities, you heard Marc talk a bunch about the new products that we are going to be bringing.  All of those things right, the pipes, the product and the technology are critical to being successful in the retail and global wealth channel. From here, we will continue to grow as appropriate, I think the rate of change will come down meaningfully, but there is still more ground to cover as we are learning there is always more ground to cover in the retail channel.  But couldn\u2019t be more excited about where things are headed and I would expect quarter-after-quarter you are going to see new product announcements from Apollo and the scale of capital raising continuing to ramp in that channel. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. \nPatrick Davitt: Morning, everyone. A follow-up on that you said one to two products a quarter over next 12 to 18 months. Should we think that to mean there is an expectation that these new products will have a media distribution and placement in wire houses et cetera? Or should we expect the usual lag to getting those products placed? \nMarc Rowan: Look, I think you are going to see the product set have immediate distribution placements. Some will be directly into wire houses, some will be directly to RIA. And I think, the thing I want to make sure I communicate is, a view that \u2013 we really, we view this as really the first inning. What\u2019s happened to-date across the entirety of our industry has been the repurposing of existing products for this channel at institutional fees.  The next phase of this is products created specifically for this marketplace that deal with the unique needs of this marketplace, diversification, no J curve, no double fees, no capital cost, semi liquid, full alignment. That\u2019s where we believe this market is going and again, I\u2019ll come back. We have as alternative managers often talked about our business in historical context where we are in the small alternative bucket be it private equity and a number of things like it.  At our Investor Day, we sought to broaden that definition to show you that we view alternatives, particularly in the yield marketplace to include investment grade. I believe the way we think about the product and the way we communicate the product is investors have had a relatively benign experience over the past decade against the backdrop of money printing which has existed since 2008 and falling rates.  On a go-forward basis, to the extent the market does not look like that, I believe that there will \u2013 investors will be challenged and will be revisiting in wholesale, the notion of 60-40, 40-60 portfolio. Our ambition is not to just serve a traditional alternatives bucket, it is to serve stable value, investment grade, total return, opportunistic, REIT, BDC, hedge and equity and to offer a complete alternatives ecosystem guided by the notion of excess return per unit of risk. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert A Lee from Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Your line is now open. \nRobert A Lee: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, this is going to be a alternative investment portfolio, so, and just maybe digging a little bit deeper, with the 46% of the assets that are being in some type of platform whether it\u2019s the retirement services origination platforms, is it reasonable to think of the SRE from those or the earnings from those platforms just being actually pretty stable quarter-to-quarter over time.  So that there is actually a pretty healthy kind of \u2013 you always had a pretty healthy stable base of revenues that throughout the last \u2013 at least by that 46% allocation? \nMarc Rowan: Yeah. That\u2019s exactly the point. These platforms are businesses that \u2013 that are producing origination flow for the underlying retirement services, fixed income portfolio and then the equity of those platforms are what\u2019s in the alternatives portfolio.  As those businesses continue to grow, as we continue to invest in those platforms, you are seeing just pretty stable scaling earnings growth in those platforms. You can see as some of the trends we\u2019ve highlighted a few on Page 16 of the earnings slides. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rufus Hone from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. \nRufus Hone : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the global wealth business and it sounds like you expect a pretty meaningful inflection in the rate of growth there over the next call it, two to three years.  And with a lot of new product launches in the pipeline, will most of these be in the broader retail or its definition you mentioned? Or will it be in the more traditional retails bucket? Or that\u2019s slightly more competition like private BDCs and private REITs and so on? And do you expect this will primarily still be a high net worth market in three to five years or do you think the market opens up more substantially over time? Thank you. \nMarc Rowan: So, it\u2019s Marc, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll hand it to Scott. All I can say is, yes. I know that that\u2019s not clarity, but recall how \u2013 in Investor Day, how we based our business. We\u2019ve set out a five year plan which includes raising a total of \u2013 having total AUM of roughly $50 billion at retail over the five year period. I believe that target is a very conservative target and I am optimistic on our chances to be able to exceed that.  How the market develops? I think we have to have some bit humility in looking forward. Product launches are notoriously complicated and we will see broad market acceptance. If you ask us for opinion, I think the market will be in the short-term high net worth. It will be balanced between or the competing traditional definition of alternatives as well as newer definition of alternatives.  And it is our job to differentiate our products on the competitive marketplace around the way we offer these products, the creativity with which we offer these products, the alignment that we will have with retail investors around these products.  And as Scott mentioned, purchase price matters. To the extent we have a vision of alternatives making up a much larger portion of a portfolio that will necessarily include the expanded definition of alternatives and consumers, be they high net worth or otherwise we will need to see all that they are making secure choices and not buying just volatility. \nScott Kleinman: Yeah, no, I would just add what Mark was alluding to, right, as this market develops, of course, it\u2019s going to start with the traditional definition of retail products that are truly institutional quality products, but offered to retail in a more attractive fashion.  But we have something that others don\u2019t have which is the combination of Apollo and Athene bring together balance sheet and alignment, product development capabilities that are extremely suited to the retail environment and those are the type of products that you are going to be seeing in the short to medium term, as well as some of the more traditional retail products. So, I hate to repeat Marc, but the answer is yes. It\u2019s an all of the above answer. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerald O'Hara from Jefferies. Your line is now open. \nGerald O'Hara : Great. Thanks. I think, Marc, you actually touched on a little bit within the SRE construct, but perhaps you can help us unpack a little of the kind of thematic drivers of the almost 8% private equity carrying value return in the quarter, obviously quite strong and just would like to hear a little bit about how that tend to be? Thank you. \nMarc Rowan: Yeah, yeah, look, this goes back to purchase price matters, right. Our PE business has built its portfolio along the lines of acquiring good cash flowing businesses where we can drive real tangible value to those businesses through earnings growth, through cost savings, through cash flow. And so, and not really dependent on rising valuations to get out at meaningfully higher values than where you entered.  So, in Q1, we saw exactly that, notwithstanding inflation that is very real in the economy. Wage inflation and materials inflation, logistics inflation, the underlying strengths of the underlying businesses allowed for price increases to continue to offset that inflation and continue to grow output. So, I mean, that\u2019s the fundamental strategy that Apollo has been pursuing for the last decade.  It hasn\u2019t been sexy over the last decade, but certainly as we enter this new economic regime change, where you can\u2019t just rely on declining or 0% rates to allow you to exit at ever increasing multiples. This is exactly the type of performance I would expect to be seeing in this type of environment. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. \nChris Kotowski : Good morning and thank you. I guess, I wanted to go back to the retirement services and a multi-part question. I mean, first is, what is the rational for reporting on a normalized spread alternative income basis as opposed to just letting the chips fall where they may? And then, secondly, how should we think about the \u2013 go back to Robert\u2019s question, the return of the alternatives portfolio over time.  In that, I mean, you were up this quarter a number of the other alternatives showed positive returns, so fine. So, this quarter, it was not correlated to the broad markets though when we look back at the first two quarters of 2020, when the public markets were negative, we also saw Athene\u2019s alternative portfolio negatively marked.  So we have this situation where sometimes the returns are seem to be correlated \u2013 or at least related to the public market comps and other times they are not. So, how should we think about the underlying returns of the old portfolio over time? \nMarc Rowan: So, this is Marc, why don\u2019t I start and then I\u2019ll hand it to Martin. And I hate to be somewhat financially oriented about this. But when Athene or any other retirement services company takes on a liability, it matches it with a portfolio of assets. 94%, 95% of those assets are fixed income and 4%, 5%, 6% of those assets are alternative in a nomenclature.  We can debate whether they are alternatives and which definition implies, but call them equity. As a quirk of accounting in the insurance industry, fixed income for certainly for regulatory purposes and otherwise is generally held at market assuming it held at book, held at cost. And the reason for that is simple. Movements in interest rates really assets and liabilities almost equally.  And while in some instances, you end up showing the mark the economics and the substance of the underlying is, you are putting an asset a liability matched on to a book over an 8, 10, 12, 15 year period. What happens in any one quarter is actually not really all that relevant. We recorded because that\u2019s what GAAP asks us to do, equity is marked on a quarterly basis.  So we show you both. We show you what actually haven\u2019t and then we show you what we think of on a normalized basis, which is how we underwrite to make our spreads work, we assume that we will earn 11% over a very long period of time from this portfolio and we provide you the metrics to judge whether or not we in fact are earning 11% over a long period of time against this portfolio, but truly what happens on a quarterly basis is just not that relative. \nMartin Kelly: I would only add that this is calling practicing the retirement services business and we are being pretty explicit in showing the math to get to non-voice metric, but as Marc said, we are showing both. And I think the chart on 16 is actually pretty instructive and in the sense of, it is \u2013 it\u2019s not a volatile portfolio. Look at the show up ratio and look at the deviation relative to the comps that we are showing. It really proves that it\u2019s a very durable portfolio at the time. Thus it\u2019s supporting a durable spread based earnings \u2013 earning stream. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian McKenna from JMP Securities. Your line is now open. \nBrian McKenna : Thanks. Most questions have been asked, but with respect to private equity Fund IX, there is clearly been a lot of value created and returns are impressive, but the fund is still only about four years old. So how should we think about the trajectory of realizations for this fund throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023? And then, do you have any expectation around the mix of monetizations as it relates to public markets versus strategic sales? \nMarc Rowan: Yes, yes, sure. So, as we look at, we are actively monetizing Fund IX and Fund VIII quite frankly. The Q2 monetizations get \u2013 given some of the volatility will probably look a lot like Q1, but based on some sale processes, some signed sale agreements, some signed dividend recap and distribution agreements, expect to see it stepping up in the back half of the year. And as these investments progress, \u201823 and \u201824 are the big harvest years for this fund. So, that\u2019s what the timeline looks like.  Obviously, as we get out into those years, market conditions will apply, is it going to skew more towards public or private exit spots. You can see by the returns value was creating incredibly nicely in that portfolio. Again not dependent on big multiple uplift but on real earnings growth. So, feel quite good about that over the next couple of years. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS. Your line is now open. \nAdam Beatty: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Want to follow-up on the portfolio of companies, appreciate Scott\u2019s comments earlier about inflation and the resiliency of the cash flow there. So just wanted to ask about the other pieces that rising rates and how the portfolio of companies are positioned.  Some other firms have mentioned having rate hedges and other things in place at the portfolio of companies allow also. Any details you could provide there would be great. Thanks a lot. \nMarc Rowan: Yes, yes, look, interest rate, interest costs are just less relevant to our portfolio than to many of our peers. Remember, we created Fund IX at an average, even a multiple of about 6.5x, right that\u2019s the leverage level for many of our peers. At the average leverage level is somewhere a little under four times. So, rising rates are interesting, but they are super impactful to the return performance of the portfolio.  On average, we are about 50-50 fixed and floating across the portfolio. We are starting to move a little more fixed but again, like I said in the five things that our deal teams think about, interest rates are number seven. It\u2019s just not particularly relevant to the total returns. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nMichael Cyprys: Hi, thank you very much for taking the follow-up here. I just wanted if you could talk a little bit about your underwriting criteria in the current environment is, obviously, you are speaking a lot about how purchase prices always matters for you, I am just curious how you are flexing the underwriting criteria just in the current environment we are in? Thank you. \nMarc Rowan: Yes. So, look, that\u2019s been the topic of a lot of conversation over the last few months. But frankly, not just in our equity portfolio, but across the entire platform. Back in March of 2020, we did something \u2013 we created what we call the common lens where we created a series of scenarios that we asked all our businesses from our equity businesses, our hybrid businesses, our yield businesses, our retirement service platforms to really model their businesses across these various scenarios so that we can start taking a collective look at the risk and opportunities in our business.  We have again recently done so with some of the recent economic changes that we\u2019ve all been talking about. And that scenario does show obviously rising rates for sure, but then how does that end? What type of either economic slowdowns or actual recessions we are modeling in. So, the firm is looking at those scenarios and modeling on a very conservative footing when it comes to the course of 2022 and into 2023. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. \nGlenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you. So, look, I think you had next to no credit losses, but that\u2019s been a great backdrop. But some people are nervous that higher rates and inflation bring recession or other credit issues. You can\u2019t do the whole balance sheet recap here. But you do a stress test for us every six months or so.  Can you talk at a high level on the positioning of where you \u2013 on the credit you own across the platform, where you are in the capital stack? How subordination, how floating rate helps and why? Just the overall message on why people maybe, should be running to Apollo in this backdrop not running away from Apollo in this backdrop?\nMarc Rowan: So, Glenn, it\u2019s Marc. I\u2019ll start at a high level. First, I will tell you, we intend to announce a day in the near future where we will do a complete balance sheet tutorial for people across Athene and the broader credit business. So that those new \u2013 newer to the story can understand exactly how we proceed. We start with a notion that we generally want to be top of the capital structure and investment grade.  When we started Athene back in 2008, 2009, it was relatively easy to source that in the marketplace. The markets were chaotic. Recall things like TALF and TARP and other nice initials. Very quickly as the markets heal themselves it became clear to us that we needed to be an originator of credit. We have referred to our business as fixed income replacement.  We are generally a replacement for investment-grade fixed income. We are generally top of the capital structure. We are generally senior secured. We do not think a retirement services business or a fixed income replacement portfolio of an institution is a place to take credit risk for equity risk. The risk we see to take is liquidity risk or structure risk.  We can afford to be less liquid, because our liabilities are less liquid and the liabilities of sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and otherwise. And so, I step back and I think about the marketplace today and I look at the various alternatives and think about where I would want to be if I were negatively biased.  I generally want to be in floating rate. But why we have a lot of that? I generally want to be top of the capital structure with good spread. We have a lot of that. I would probably not want to be subordinated and fixed rate. That\u2019s not where we are. The business that we have built is a fixed income replacement business. That is not to say there are not other good businesses.  But it is a very different business than our peer set for better or worse. In some markets, peers may perform better. In a market like this, purchase price matters, being the top of the capital structure matters, being senior secured matters and I think we will fair very well.  The stress test, which, as you know our industry does not publish, we run the Fed CCAR, we publish it. We run our risk appetite, we publish it. We run Lehman, we publish it. We will do our best to educate the investor universe that what the risk we are taking is liquidity risk and structure risk and not credit risk. \nOperator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for Q&A. I will now turn the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing remarks. \nNoah Gunn : Thanks everyone for joining us this morning for your continued interest in Apollo.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Kleinman",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. Our business is built to withstand and even thrive in times of macro volatility and market disruption. This was most clearly demonstrated by our strong first quarter investment performance, which is underpinned by purchase price discipline and downside protection, as well as a focus on investments in companies with strong cash flow generation.  As Marc mentioned, our overall private equity portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by 12% in the first quarter and our long-term track record remains very strong across our flagship strategies. Fund IX appreciated 15% during the quarter, which was substantially all driven by EBITDA growth. Similarly, on a life-to-date basis, approximately 90% of the value creation achieved by Fund IX has been from EBITDA growth.  As of quarter end Fund IX\u2019s inception-to-date performance is a stellar gross IRR of 52% and 34% net showcasing the significant alpha we are capable of generating for our clients. As it relates to Fund X fundraising, we continue to feel very confident in meeting our $25 billion target.  Despite some congestion in the private equity fundraising market others have cited, as well as the impact of the denominator effect on LP appetite for additional private equity exposure, we are still seeing solid support from our existing LP base and new commitments from an array of investors including the global wealth community. We believe our differentiated strategy and strong investment performance are setting us apart in this current volatile markets backdrop.  Additionally, yield strategies held up very well during the quarter amid higher rates and wider credit spreads with direct origination and corporate credit strategies outperforming their benchmark indices by 350 basis points and 70 basis points respectively. This outperformance was driven by both higher allocations of floating rate securities, as well as superior individual credit selection.  We continue to believe the yield-oriented funds we manage are well-positioned for sustained period of higher interest rates. We apply the same discipline \u2013 excuse me, the same emphasis on price discipline downside protection and excess return generation in managing Athene\u2019s investment portfolio. Our ability to produce excess spread comes from moving out the liquidity spectrum, not taking incremental credit risk.  As evidence of our focus on underwriting and credit quality, it\u2019s worth noting that Athene\u2019s historical credit losses have only amounted to seven basis points over the last five years. Additionally, 95% of Athene\u2019s fixed income portfolio is invested in investment-grade securities. During the first quarter, we remained active in deploying Athene\u2019s balance sheet cash into attractive investments with a weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases exceeding the Triple B corporate bond index.  Recall that we benefit from a structurally low cost of funds, given that we built Athene\u2019s business during a decade of historically low rates. The assets supporting these funds are generally matched from day one allowing us to lock in attractive spreads. We\u2019ve allocated a portion of these assets to floating rate investments that will benefit from rising interest rates as Martin will discuss later.  Additionally, we\u2019ve constructed a differentiated alternatives portfolio comprising 6% of Athene\u2019s assets. In the market environment we saw in the first quarter with equity market volatility, rising rates and inflation, Athene\u2019s limited exposure to public equities and sizable allocation to strategic asset origination and retirement services platforms, as well as diversified credit, real estate and natural resource investments drove meaningful outperformance.  In particular, we expect the things investments in origination platforms to increase in value in a rising rate environment coupled with tighter liquidity conditions.  Switching to deployment, periods of dislocation and volatility also provide opportunity to put capital to work and our low cost of capital allows us the flexibility to be responsive and opportunistic in our deployment activity. With equity valuations normalizing and borrowing rates rising, we are engaging in an increasing amount of strategic dialogues with companies looking for ways to fund their growth via creative capital solutions.  We are also seeing opportunities arise from liquidity-driven dislocations, particularly in leverage finance and the convertible bond market. Total gross deployment, which is a measure of our aggregate investing activity totaled $48 billion in the first quarter, which included $6 billion from drawdown deployment. Following a quieter fourth quarter, we were active in making new commitments for Fund IX, including our pending investments in Tenneco, Novolex and Ingenico to name a few.  At the end of March, Fund IX was 90% committed or invested. We have $2 billion to $3 billion of dry powder left to deploy from Fund IX before we would need to commence the investment period for Fund X. Origination activity, as Marc mentioned represents the alpha generating investments we source across our debt business.  Strength in the first quarter origination volume was driven by more traditional origination activity such as commercial real estate debt lending and CLO debt. This was complemented by origination activity from platforms including our scale to middle market direct lending business and more recent additions such as Wheels Donlen and Newfi.  In terms of capital raising, inflows of $31 billion in the first quarter were robust and diversified bringing our total inflows over the last 12 months to $91 billion. Inflows from asset management totaling $19 billion in the first quarter included $12 billion from broad based fundraising activities in several strategies including a court 5 total return Apollo debt solutions hybrid value and our new capital markets partnership among several others.  Inflows from retirement services totaled approximately $12 billion in the first quarter, the second highest quarter of organic inflows Athene has generated to-date. The business continues to source attractive profitable growth that has the dual benefit of growing fee and spread-related earnings. It\u2019s worth highlighting that we now raised over $7 billion of AUM for high-grade alpha managed accounts.  The underlying clients of which are third-party insurance companies, which we believe validates the alpha generating strategy we employed for Athene on a day-to-day basis. Based on our strong first quarter fundraising results, we feel comfortable meeting or exceeding our previously communicated $80 billion organic inflow guidance for 2022.  Importantly, inflows from our global wealth platform accounted for more than 10% of asset management fundraising in the quarter, double our historic average. As Marc alluded to, we are building a tailored product suite across the risk reward spectrum that is purposely designed for this market and expect to launch one to two new retail products every quarter over the next 18 to 24 months.  This includes our non-traded direct real estate income vehicle, Apollo Realty Income Solutions or ARIS, which publicly filed the registration statement with the SEC in April. We are also seeing significant institutional overlap with products that were designed for the global wealth market, which we believe to drive upside to our fundraising targets this year.  As Marc mentioned, we are seeing momentum in several of our newer end scaling strategies including total return, credit secondaries, Apollo Debt Solutions, as well as our third-party insurance business. As these initiatives trend favorably, we are also continuing to invest in several growth opportunities and bring in outside talent and resources where appropriate in order to capture the white space opportunities around our core capabilities.  These adjacencies will seek to expand our product set where we believe we have a competitive edge and could drive meaningful upside to our long-term growth trajectory. During the first quarter, we announced the launch of a comprehensive sustainable investing platform focused on financing and investing in global energy transition.  We view the energy transition opportunity as a cross-platform endeavor harnessing the talent of investment professionals, not only from our equity platform but across our yield, hybrid, infrastructure and natural resource franchises.  Our platform is targeting to deploy $50 billion in clean energy and climate capital over the next five years with the opportunity to deploy over $100 billion by 2030. While these figures may seem large, it\u2019s really only a drop in the bucket. By comparison, we expect financing in the decarbonization of industry to require approximately $5 trillion per year in capital investment over the next twenty years.  To advance these goals, we are planning on raising dedicated capital vehicles. We are in the process of marketing a climate finance fund and expect to launch an energy transition equity vehicle later this year. Expanding and broadening our secondaries platform is another one of our strategic priorities given the scalability of the business and large growing opportunity set.  The ecosystem we are targeting is broad and dynamic and extends beyond the traditional definition of LP secondaries. We are building out a comprehensive toolkit including continuation vehicles, GP and fund financing, as well as credit secondaries to address the needs of this market holistically. We are focused on adding talent and scale to these newer initiatives and have recently made strategic hires with experience in the equity secondaries market to augment our existing talent and capabilities.  Given the progress we\u2019ve made so far, you\u2019ll begin to see us raising and deploying significant amounts of capital across this platform in new and non-traditional ways. In Asia, we continue to see massive untapped potential to bring our yield and hybrid strategies to this market, particularly in Japan, Australia and India.  One of our most seasoned senior colleagues is leading our expansion into Asia and we are also hiring talent on the ground. Our leadership team is increasingly engaged with insurance companies, banks and pension plans across the region who are interested in our retirement service solutions and fixed income replacement capabilities.  And lastly, as I mentioned at Investor Day, we see significant white space opportunities from bringing together the broader Apollo platform with best-in-class sector expertise in areas where we don\u2019t have a historic footprint, particularly as we enter what we expect to be a period of extended market volatility.  As always, we approach all new opportunities with a purchase price matters mentality and believe adding specialized intellectual capital across our yield, hybrid and equity strategies will bring new capabilities to the broader Apollo ecosystem.  We are beginning to partner with leading high quality companies possessing these capabilities that will be accretive across the platform. By way of example, as you saw with our investment in Motive last year, we chose to partner with them due to their FinTech expertise to explore investment opportunities and potential new capabilities that we otherwise would not have pursued.  We\u2019ve been working on a number of exciting things and expect to announce several partnerships in the coming months in areas such as life science, software and hard tech.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Martin, who will discuss our financial results in detail. Yes, I would just chime in that, yeah, as Marc said, the origination teams are as busy as they\u2019ve ever been. So, the rising rate environment, the tightening of the liquidity environment is making things even more attractive. Yes, sure. Look, as Marc mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ve seen over the last year headcount go from about 25 to about 145. That gives us a really strong footing for both our high net worth as well as RIA channels to be able to \u2013 to support that, as well as the product development capabilities, you heard Marc talk a bunch about the new products that we are going to be bringing.  All of those things right, the pipes, the product and the technology are critical to being successful in the retail and global wealth channel. From here, we will continue to grow as appropriate, I think the rate of change will come down meaningfully, but there is still more ground to cover as we are learning there is always more ground to cover in the retail channel.  But couldn\u2019t be more excited about where things are headed and I would expect quarter-after-quarter you are going to see new product announcements from Apollo and the scale of capital raising continuing to ramp in that channel. Yeah, no, I would just add what Mark was alluding to, right, as this market develops, of course, it\u2019s going to start with the traditional definition of retail products that are truly institutional quality products, but offered to retail in a more attractive fashion.  But we have something that others don\u2019t have which is the combination of Apollo and Athene bring together balance sheet and alignment, product development capabilities that are extremely suited to the retail environment and those are the type of products that you are going to be seeing in the short to medium term, as well as some of the more traditional retail products. So, I hate to repeat Marc, but the answer is yes. It\u2019s an all of the above answer."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Scott. Our first quarter results represent a really solid foundation for our next chapter as a large and more profitable monopoly. Following our merger with Athene, our earnings power is greatly enhanced. The durable and recurring nature of fee and spread-related earnings is a powerful and highly valuable combination that we believe will be increasingly appreciated as we execute on the interactive financial plan we presented last October.  For the first quarter, we reported fee-related earnings of $310 million or $0.52 per share, which increased modestly year-over-year reflecting higher revenues and increased cost associated with investing in our business for growth as both Marc and Scott mentioned. Importantly, fee-related revenues from professional capital represents over 50% of our total fee revenue providing enhanced durability and compounding growth potential of this viable earnings stream.  Management fees increased 11% year-over-year, driven by robust and broad based inflows from retirement services, institutional and retail clients, as well as strong deployment activity in funds that earn management fees on invested capital.  While the quarter included some catch-up fees in yield, we expect further management fee growth for our yield strategies over 2022, driven by our focus on origination of differentiated assets through our platforms. We held the final close for our Griffin acquisition last week which adds two integral funds totaling approximately $6.5 billion of fee-generating AUM.  Griffin has continued to see growth in total sales from its real estate and credit funds since the acquisition was signed last December.  First quarter advisory and transaction fees of $64 million increased 16% year-over-year, but faced some sequential pressure from low overall capital markets activity in the first quarter as Marc mentioned. Capital Solutions activity has picked up so far in the second quarter with transaction fees runrating at a higher level compared to the first quarter.  Turning to fee-related expenses, the year-over-year increase reflects our continued investment in talent and the previously communicated rebasing of our non-compensation cost structure in 2022 following the expansion of our global team and including higher occupancy and technology costs necessary to support the firm\u2019s next leg of growth.  We expect to continue growing into a higher runrate expense level, as we progress throughout the year consistent with the trends we outlined at our Investor Day. With that said, we expect to generate positive operating leverage as we enter 2023 as the pace of expense growth slows.  Moving to our retirement services segment, we generated spread-related earnings of $670 million in the first quarter or $1.12 per share, driven by a net investment spread of 186 basis points and translating to a net spread of 148 basis points. Our SRE reflects the impacts of purchase accounting whereby we were acquired to mark-to-market the assets and liabilities on Athene's balance sheet at the date of the merger close. This resulted in a rebasing of our fixed income investment yield, cost of funds, and financing costs.  The net one-time impact to our net investment spread was a two basis point benefit in the quarter. The primary driver of our particularly strong SRE results was an elevated asset yield and specifically the portion derived from alternative investment income.  94% of Athene\u2019s investment portfolio is invested in fixed income securities and our SRE includes the effective yield on these assets. The remaining at 6% of Athene\u2019s portfolio is comprised of differentiated downside protected alternative investments which are marked on a quarterly basis.  In the first quarter, income generated from these alternative investments was above the long-term trend of 12% producing an annualized return of 17%. Recall that the construction of this portfolio is strategic origination and retirement services platforms as well as Apollo\u2019s fund investments principally equity and hybrid.  Since the vast majority of this portfolio is not tied to public equities or technologies specifically, it\u2019s not surprising to see outperformance relative to the public equity markets. You can see the high level composition of the portfolio on Page 15 within our earnings presentation. Within this portfolio, performance from strategic origination platforms was particularly strong and generated 11% annualized return.  These businesses have spread-based characteristics and as Scott mentioned benefit from a rising rate environment. As we\u2019ve been emphasizing proprietary and recurring asset origination is an extremely important differentiator for us. We hold these investments in these origination vehicles through Athene, which provides a capital-efficient structure effective of earnings assets for Athene\u2019s investment portfolio and frees up capital at the holding company level for other strategic growth investments.  Strategic investments in other retirement services businesses also performed well. These are also typically spread-based businesses that generally benefit in a rising rate environment and include investments such as Athora, Venerable, Challenger and FWD. These investments generated a 17% annualized return during the first quarter.  And lastly, the performance of investments in Apollo and other managed funds was the largest source of strength generating a 19% return for the quarter. Every sub asset class component of the fund investments contributed to the result with real estate outperforming in the \u2013 amid inflationary trends and complemented by appreciation in private equity and natural resources funds.  Given the typical quarterly fluctuations in Athene\u2019s alternative returns, we also present normalized SRE assuming a constant return of 11%, slightly below Athene\u2019s long-term average of 12%. We also normalized for certain notable items generally related to adjustments to long-term liability assumptions, which can vary favorably or unfavorably from period-to-period.  We do not recognize these items as recurring income until that\u2019s clearly becoming a trend. Assuming normalized alternative returns of 11% and reducing for certain notable items, SRE would have been $488 million in the first quarter translating to a normalized net spread of 108 basis points on a net basis. As Scott mentioned, our earnings benefit from rising rates given that Athene\u2019s has invested in $37 million of floating rate securities, and only has $11 billion of floating rate liabilities.  Approximately, 60% of the net floating rate exposure is tied to three month LIBOR with the remainder split between one month and other basis. Due to the timing of resets relative to the timing of rising spot rates, we experienced only a modest earnings benefit from higher short-term rates in the first quarter. In dollar terms, we expect every 25 basis point overall shift in the curve to drive an additional $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE.  If the forward curve materializes as of April 30, we see approximately $0.30 per share of upside to SRE in 2022, specific to a benefit from higher rates.  Our retirement services business creates a locked in liability cost other than relatively small reserve adjustments for changes in expected behavior at the tail end of the contracts. For GAAP reporting, we are required to recognize the interest rate and current spread changes on assets supporting the insurance contracts that we are not committed to recognize similar changes on the associated liabilities.  Our reported GAAP loss in the first quarter was driven by interest rate driven unrealized investment losses on fixed income securities held through reinsurance. For comparability and consistency, our SRE metric adjusts for this specific treatment on reinsured assets.  Lastly moving to our principal investing segment, we\u2019ve reported principal investing income of $187 million in the first quarter or $0.31 per share. We realized performance fee generation which relatively light in the quarter in view of turbulent markets. Our current two flagship private equity funds, Funds VIII and IX remain planned to monetize the portfolios when we feel the market backdrop is opportunity to harvest.  Realized investment income included $206 million from realized gains on the transfer of the majority of Apollo\u2019s GP investments. This portfolio was transferred to Athene in the first quarter and we expect it will soon be transferred to a fund managed by Apollo including third-party capital to support fund-raising in a new strategy.  We know that we are now presenting halt curve and other financing costs as a separate line item on our income statement outside PII. We estimate that PII in 2022 will align with our multi-year forecast of approximately $1 per share on average excluding interest and financing costs over the next five years.  Now turning to capital, we spent $325 million in the quarter to repurchase shares to offset diversion with respect to employee share deliveries in line with our plan to immunize our share count from equity-based compensation.  Given the recent dislocation in our stock, we are actively evaluating opportunistic share repurchases, as part of our announced share repurchase program, while continuing to balance investing in interesting investments such would accelerate our growth profile over the long-term.  We utilized approximately $150 million of capital from the holding company on strategic investments in the first quarter primarily for our investment in case. Athene ended the quarter in a strong capital position with $7.3 billion of deployable capital including $3.3 billion of excess equity capital, $2.9 billion of untapped debt capacity, and $1.1 billion of dry powder in the paid up side curve.  At the end of the first quarter, our net balance sheet value was $2.5 billion or $4.22 per share, which included cash and equivalents of $2.2 billion. In line with our fixed dividend policy, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share in the first quarter.  So to wrap up and to echo Marc, our first quarter results set us up very well for a strong year of growth. We are excited to share the progress we continue to make executing our long-term strategic plan in the coming quarters.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. So, hey Glenn, it\u2019s Martin. It\u2019s not $5 billion, it\u2019s much less than that. It\u2019s a portion of the existing GP investments. You will notice that the balance sheet went down significantly. Most of that drop is related to the merger.  The investment we had in Athene obviously goes away on consummation of the merger. So, what we are moving is a majority of the GP sites that we are in funds that we manage and then moving to a vehicle which we expect will occur in the second quarter to support a third-party capital-raising initiative. Right, with further benefits that are seen with the floating rate assets and higher rates increases the origination of annuity products. So, it\u2019s a benefit around the whole system. I would only add that this is calling practicing the retirement services business and we are being pretty explicit in showing the math to get to non-voice metric, but as Marc said, we are showing both. And I think the chart on 16 is actually pretty instructive and in the sense of, it is \u2013 it\u2019s not a volatile portfolio. Look at the show up ratio and look at the deviation relative to the comps that we are showing. It really proves that it\u2019s a very durable portfolio at the time. Thus it\u2019s supporting a durable spread based earnings \u2013 earning stream."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah, and good morning to all. Needless to say we are pleased with the first quarter results. As you know, during the quarter, we completed the merger with Athene. In a period of great volatility, the merger preceded seamlessly as did the closing of the financial statements. As Noah mentioned, the first quarter results showcased the combined earnings power of the business.  The trends that we are seeing in the marketplace, specifically rates up and volatility historically have been very good for our business, particularly as it relates to spread-related earnings, which is biased to the upside with rising rates as I am sure Martin will detail in his remarks.  FRE, SRE, spread-related earnings and robust inflows position us to meet or exceed our 2022 financial targets in the aggregate, and each of the pieces. Martin again will take you through that in detail in his section. So as I\u2019d like to think about the strength of the alternatives business, the purpose of the alternatives business is to produce excess return per unit of risk.  For us, purchase price matters as an investment philosophy permeates everything we do. Pricing and valuation are important for return generation really for the first time in about 14 years. As you see in the results, our PE portfolio was up 8% versus minus 5% for the S&P 500 and minus 9% for the NASDAQ. The era of being able to achieve results on the back half of declining rates and increasing liquidity I believe to be at an end separating alpha from beta. Our approach on purchase price matters is resonating with clients in this macro backdrop. Purchase price matters is not only a tool that we think about in the equity business. As I suggested it permeates everything we do. In our hybrid business, by giving away a portion of the upside and protecting the downside, we express purchase price matters.  In our yield business, our yield business is primarily driven by senior secured, top of the capital structure, investment-grade and floating rate. Purchase price matters even in the yield business. We began 2022 with tangible progress against the three goals, three bets essentially that we\u2019ve made to power the company over the next five years. Origination, retail and capital solution. In origination, volume for Q1 was some $22 billion and runrating at a $100 billion. Recall that our five year target is to push that on a runrate basis to $150 billion.  We completed acquisitions in the quarter of PACE, Foundation and Newfi. These are platforms, platforms you should think of as permanent origination. In our industry, we spend a lot of time talking about permanent capital, permanent origination is just as important as permanent capital. We positioned ourselves as a scaled solutions provider executing deals with speed and certainty.  Two of that I\u2019d like to mention for the quarter, Aldar, a $1.4 billion commitment, it\u2019s one of the largest foreign direct investments in Abu Dhabi\u2019s private sector, investment-grade primarily; SoftBank, some $5.1 billion, investment-grade. These are the kinds of transactions in the originated marketplace that allow us to provide our balance sheet and our clients excess return per unit of risk even against the backdrop of a volatile market.  Let me turn to Capital Solutions next. Capital Solutions had a pretty good quarter even against the backdrop of market volatility. We are well positioned to deliver on the 2022 growth targets notwithstanding what\u2019s happened in the first quarter. The Q2 pipeline is incredibly strong and very encouraging.  As you know, we announced the strategic partnership with Mubadala to capitalize on these origination activities augmenting the volume of origination and syndication activity we can now execute. Again, a very good start for the year and I expect we will meet or exceed the targets we have in Capital Solutions. Again, recall, in our five year plan that we\u2019ve projected $500 million of revenues over the five year period or I should say at the end of the five year period.  Let me turn to Global Wealth. Judging by the reporting coming out of the earnings season for the alternatives peer group, what\u2019s happening in Global Wealth seems to be of interest to the analyst community and to the marketplace and it should be. We made meaningful progress against Global Wealth and our objectives in Q1.  We added 125 dedicated employees bringing our total employment in Global Wealth to a 145, I believe to be the second largest global wealth team amongst alternative peers. Team alone is going to define success. Here, the acquisition of Griffin, which will be completed in all facets in the second quarter is an incredibly exciting partnership, we\u2019re off to a very good start and we expect to see significant progress.  Apollo Debt Solutions, our private BDC continues to enjoy fundraising traction and we expect to expand and internationalize distribution over the year and the quarters as we continue to deploy and we see strong demand across a variety of wealth channels, particularly RIAs.  Let me spend a minute and talk about how we see the global wealth market. First, I think I need to backup and I need to define what we believe to be an alternative. An alternative to us is simply an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. That definition encompasses an incredibly large marketplace versus a definition historically that where alternatives have been thought of as private equity and a variety of very opportunistic products.  We like those products. Those products are the foundation of our business but the market for alternatives is broader than perhaps we even imagined. I believe you will see the global wealth market develop along two lines over the coming years, one will be against the backdrop of traditional definitions of alternatives. Think of that as private funds. Think of that as BDCs. Think of that as REITs.  In many instances, these products have been in the marketplace for decades, but for the first time are being offered to clients at its institutional fee scales and with ease of access through technologically augmented implementation and with a much better understanding at the end-client of the purpose and of the value behind these products. And needless to say, clients really like them. We\u2019ve seen tremendous take up of alternatives using that definition over the past few years. But I believe that there is a broader market. And the broader market really will help clients deal with what I would say is their traditional portfolios to the extent a high net worth client might have been following a 40-60 portfolio or a traditional, I believe that they will struggle in the coming years with volatility in rates, indexation in markets, volatility of equity to meet their retirement needs.  You will see us focus on the next generation of products later this year. We intend to launch the first of a generation of products specifically created for this marketplace. We are focused not just on alternatives but on equity replacement. I could see today in the not too distant future when a clients portfolio is not 10% or 15% alternatives, but it\u2019s 50% alternatives.  Alternatives under the definition of an alternatives to publicly traded stocks and bonds. We believe that alternatives exist from double A to equity and our job is to bring those products to market and offer clients excess return per unit of risk. Most clients can afford to take some amount of liquidity risk across their portfolio. The product set that we envision is large, and scalable and coming soon.  Culturally, this has been an amazing quarter. What we are doing, what we are saying is resonating in the professional services marketplace. This is incredibly critical to attract and retain talent. For the first quarter, we hired 185 new Apollo employees, turnover is down and satisfaction is up.  To close, the optionality in our business is huge. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress on our strategic growth initiatives in a relatively short amount of time and we have some exciting developments in capitalizing on white space opportunities in front of us.  I will now turn the call over Scott to provide you with some detail on these developments and also cover key drivers of our Q1 results. Look, it\u2019s Marc, I\u2019ll start with the balance sheet and then we\u2019ll talk about origination. So, as Scott mentioned in the call, when Athene or quite frankly any other retirement services company assumes a liability, it matches it with assets and we so-called AOM matching. There is a portion of that that needs to be reinvested over a period of time representing the profit on the contract.  When people talk about AOM matching, they are talking about matching an asset and the liability, but profit to some extent is unhedged and therefore if you are putting assets on the books in a rate environment that are higher than the rate environment when you assume the liability that is generally a positive.  In addition, what we\u2019ve seen is, a benefit from floating rate. Now your specific question as it relates to origination, generally what we have seen is the \u2013 at the newly underwritten product is being underwritten in the context of higher rates and yet our funding cost on these platforms are relatively sticky, so we\u2019ve seen expanding margins across the platform.  To the extent rising rates, and just to give you a sense in the \u2013 through I guess, the last week, the investment-grade market was off 17%. It\u2019s made people gunshot and we\u2019ve seen this across most public credit markets to the extent there is dislocation in public credit markets, we are a better more secure, more definite source of capital. All of those things benefit on average we are better off with rising rates. Let\u2019s do it at the highest level and just to give you \u2013 it\u2019s Marc, by the way, context from the Investor Day. We said at Investor Day that we expect to generate $15 billion of excess capital over the next five years. $5 billion to support what we\u2019ll call the base dividend, $5 billion for investment in the business and $5 billion that we would use opportunistically either to invest or for buybacks or for dividends, I think Martin said it best given where the stock is, we expect to use a portion of that to buy back stock.  The stock is very attractive from our point of view. Now, one needs to actually generate the $5 billion to be able to spend it, but one can argue that probably the highest and best use of our excess capital is our own stock. Look, I think you are going to see the product set have immediate distribution placements. Some will be directly into wire houses, some will be directly to RIA. And I think, the thing I want to make sure I communicate is, a view that \u2013 we really, we view this as really the first inning. What\u2019s happened to-date across the entirety of our industry has been the repurposing of existing products for this channel at institutional fees.  The next phase of this is products created specifically for this marketplace that deal with the unique needs of this marketplace, diversification, no J curve, no double fees, no capital cost, semi liquid, full alignment. That\u2019s where we believe this market is going and again, I\u2019ll come back. We have as alternative managers often talked about our business in historical context where we are in the small alternative bucket be it private equity and a number of things like it.  At our Investor Day, we sought to broaden that definition to show you that we view alternatives, particularly in the yield marketplace to include investment grade. I believe the way we think about the product and the way we communicate the product is investors have had a relatively benign experience over the past decade against the backdrop of money printing which has existed since 2008 and falling rates.  On a go-forward basis, to the extent the market does not look like that, I believe that there will \u2013 investors will be challenged and will be revisiting in wholesale, the notion of 60-40, 40-60 portfolio. Our ambition is not to just serve a traditional alternatives bucket, it is to serve stable value, investment grade, total return, opportunistic, REIT, BDC, hedge and equity and to offer a complete alternatives ecosystem guided by the notion of excess return per unit of risk. Yeah. That\u2019s exactly the point. These platforms are businesses that \u2013 that are producing origination flow for the underlying retirement services, fixed income portfolio and then the equity of those platforms are what\u2019s in the alternatives portfolio.  As those businesses continue to grow, as we continue to invest in those platforms, you are seeing just pretty stable scaling earnings growth in those platforms. You can see as some of the trends we\u2019ve highlighted a few on Page 16 of the earnings slides. So, it\u2019s Marc, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll hand it to Scott. All I can say is, yes. I know that that\u2019s not clarity, but recall how \u2013 in Investor Day, how we based our business. We\u2019ve set out a five year plan which includes raising a total of \u2013 having total AUM of roughly $50 billion at retail over the five year period. I believe that target is a very conservative target and I am optimistic on our chances to be able to exceed that.  How the market develops? I think we have to have some bit humility in looking forward. Product launches are notoriously complicated and we will see broad market acceptance. If you ask us for opinion, I think the market will be in the short-term high net worth. It will be balanced between or the competing traditional definition of alternatives as well as newer definition of alternatives.  And it is our job to differentiate our products on the competitive marketplace around the way we offer these products, the creativity with which we offer these products, the alignment that we will have with retail investors around these products.  And as Scott mentioned, purchase price matters. To the extent we have a vision of alternatives making up a much larger portion of a portfolio that will necessarily include the expanded definition of alternatives and consumers, be they high net worth or otherwise we will need to see all that they are making secure choices and not buying just volatility. Yeah, yeah, look, this goes back to purchase price matters, right. Our PE business has built its portfolio along the lines of acquiring good cash flowing businesses where we can drive real tangible value to those businesses through earnings growth, through cost savings, through cash flow. And so, and not really dependent on rising valuations to get out at meaningfully higher values than where you entered.  So, in Q1, we saw exactly that, notwithstanding inflation that is very real in the economy. Wage inflation and materials inflation, logistics inflation, the underlying strengths of the underlying businesses allowed for price increases to continue to offset that inflation and continue to grow output. So, I mean, that\u2019s the fundamental strategy that Apollo has been pursuing for the last decade.  It hasn\u2019t been sexy over the last decade, but certainly as we enter this new economic regime change, where you can\u2019t just rely on declining or 0% rates to allow you to exit at ever increasing multiples. This is exactly the type of performance I would expect to be seeing in this type of environment. So, this is Marc, why don\u2019t I start and then I\u2019ll hand it to Martin. And I hate to be somewhat financially oriented about this. But when Athene or any other retirement services company takes on a liability, it matches it with a portfolio of assets. 94%, 95% of those assets are fixed income and 4%, 5%, 6% of those assets are alternative in a nomenclature.  We can debate whether they are alternatives and which definition implies, but call them equity. As a quirk of accounting in the insurance industry, fixed income for certainly for regulatory purposes and otherwise is generally held at market assuming it held at book, held at cost. And the reason for that is simple. Movements in interest rates really assets and liabilities almost equally.  And while in some instances, you end up showing the mark the economics and the substance of the underlying is, you are putting an asset a liability matched on to a book over an 8, 10, 12, 15 year period. What happens in any one quarter is actually not really all that relevant. We recorded because that\u2019s what GAAP asks us to do, equity is marked on a quarterly basis.  So we show you both. We show you what actually haven\u2019t and then we show you what we think of on a normalized basis, which is how we underwrite to make our spreads work, we assume that we will earn 11% over a very long period of time from this portfolio and we provide you the metrics to judge whether or not we in fact are earning 11% over a long period of time against this portfolio, but truly what happens on a quarterly basis is just not that relative. Yes, yes, sure. So, as we look at, we are actively monetizing Fund IX and Fund VIII quite frankly. The Q2 monetizations get \u2013 given some of the volatility will probably look a lot like Q1, but based on some sale processes, some signed sale agreements, some signed dividend recap and distribution agreements, expect to see it stepping up in the back half of the year. And as these investments progress, \u201823 and \u201824 are the big harvest years for this fund. So, that\u2019s what the timeline looks like.  Obviously, as we get out into those years, market conditions will apply, is it going to skew more towards public or private exit spots. You can see by the returns value was creating incredibly nicely in that portfolio. Again not dependent on big multiple uplift but on real earnings growth. So, feel quite good about that over the next couple of years. Yes, yes, look, interest rate, interest costs are just less relevant to our portfolio than to many of our peers. Remember, we created Fund IX at an average, even a multiple of about 6.5x, right that\u2019s the leverage level for many of our peers. At the average leverage level is somewhere a little under four times. So, rising rates are interesting, but they are super impactful to the return performance of the portfolio.  On average, we are about 50-50 fixed and floating across the portfolio. We are starting to move a little more fixed but again, like I said in the five things that our deal teams think about, interest rates are number seven. It\u2019s just not particularly relevant to the total returns. Yes. So, look, that\u2019s been the topic of a lot of conversation over the last few months. But frankly, not just in our equity portfolio, but across the entire platform. Back in March of 2020, we did something \u2013 we created what we call the common lens where we created a series of scenarios that we asked all our businesses from our equity businesses, our hybrid businesses, our yield businesses, our retirement service platforms to really model their businesses across these various scenarios so that we can start taking a collective look at the risk and opportunities in our business.  We have again recently done so with some of the recent economic changes that we\u2019ve all been talking about. And that scenario does show obviously rising rates for sure, but then how does that end? What type of either economic slowdowns or actual recessions we are modeling in. So, the firm is looking at those scenarios and modeling on a very conservative footing when it comes to the course of 2022 and into 2023. So, Glenn, it\u2019s Marc. I\u2019ll start at a high level. First, I will tell you, we intend to announce a day in the near future where we will do a complete balance sheet tutorial for people across Athene and the broader credit business. So that those new \u2013 newer to the story can understand exactly how we proceed. We start with a notion that we generally want to be top of the capital structure and investment grade.  When we started Athene back in 2008, 2009, it was relatively easy to source that in the marketplace. The markets were chaotic. Recall things like TALF and TARP and other nice initials. Very quickly as the markets heal themselves it became clear to us that we needed to be an originator of credit. We have referred to our business as fixed income replacement.  We are generally a replacement for investment-grade fixed income. We are generally top of the capital structure. We are generally senior secured. We do not think a retirement services business or a fixed income replacement portfolio of an institution is a place to take credit risk for equity risk. The risk we see to take is liquidity risk or structure risk.  We can afford to be less liquid, because our liabilities are less liquid and the liabilities of sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and otherwise. And so, I step back and I think about the marketplace today and I look at the various alternatives and think about where I would want to be if I were negatively biased.  I generally want to be in floating rate. But why we have a lot of that? I generally want to be top of the capital structure with good spread. We have a lot of that. I would probably not want to be subordinated and fixed rate. That\u2019s not where we are. The business that we have built is a fixed income replacement business. That is not to say there are not other good businesses.  But it is a very different business than our peer set for better or worse. In some markets, peers may perform better. In a market like this, purchase price matters, being the top of the capital structure matters, being senior secured matters and I think we will fair very well.  The stress test, which, as you know our industry does not publish, we run the Fed CCAR, we publish it. We run our risk appetite, we publish it. We run Lehman, we publish it. We will do our best to educate the investor universe that what the risk we are taking is liquidity risk and structure risk and not credit risk."

This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks, Donna. And welcome again, everyone, to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the investor relations portion of our website. And in short, fourth quarter results rounded out an exceptionally strong year for both our asset management and retirement services businesses. Our 2 primary earnings streams, fee-related earnings and spread-related earnings, grew more than 25% to a record $4.9 billion in 2023. Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported record adjusted net income of $4.1 billion or $6.74 per share for the full year. One change to highlight in our financial reporting included with this morning's results. Beginning this quarter, within retirement services, you'll see spread-related earnings excluding notable items. And further down the page, we provide additional information highlighting the delta to arrive at our long-term return expectation for Athene's alternative investments. This information is useful in order to understand how we think about Athene's earnings power on a multiyear basis excluding quarterly mark-to-market fluctuations. And importantly, this change has no impact on historically reported SRE or the magnitude of historically reported notable items. So joining me to discuss our strong results in more detail and outlook for the year ahead are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And with that, I'll hand over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thanks, Noah. And it's my pleasure to actually walk through what was a very strong year both in growth and execution. If you had told me at the beginning of the year that we were going to grow 25%-plus in FRE and 26% in SRE and that we would do that successfully, we would be doing a victory lap here; and I assure you we are, in fact, doing that victory lap. Those ranges, while I wish they were recurring every year, are not the normal expectation you should have for the business. We've consistently guided all of our investors to what I believe and we believe is a long-term growth rate in FRE, which is 15% to 20% in a non-flagship year; and to low double-digit growth in SRE. 2023 was truly exceptional. Recall that, particularly in our SRE segment in our retirement services segment, we are not a near-term profit maximizer. 2023 was extraordinary. We ended the year holding more than $12 billion of cash. We also used the very strong results to begin the creation of a countercyclical portfolio, which had us for the first time in a long time make a significant move into treasuries. While this costs us near-term SRE, it gives us flexibility to redeploy into very strong origination volumes, which you will hear about. In the third quarter, just -- excuse me. In the fourth quarter, just to highlight how strong originations volumes were, we did north of $30 billion of originations. We hope to continue up that pace. And having a pile of cash and a treasury portfolio will allow us to continue to grow SRE in the low double digits, which is what we seek to do. Away from earnings. Margins were up over 200 basis points. AUM hit a record $651 billion. Inflows were $160 billion. And Athene had record inflows of $66 billion. Even in inflows, Athene is not a near-term profit maximizer. This was an opportunity to really shape the kind of business and the kind of distribution that Athene wanted. And we would expect to exceed this number in terms of originations, organic originations, for Athene moving into 2024. 2024, we see as a year of continued momentum, but we also see it taking shape slightly differently than 2023. Credit, we believe, will dominate 2024. Growth at Athene and equity strategies other than PE. Martin will spend time in his remarks discussing the '24 outlook and the finer details of Q4. I thought what I would do is spend my time and provide a little bit of historical perspective and road map as to where we're going. We've just come back from our partners retreat, where all 201 Apollo partners get together and we discuss the outlook. And I began those remarks by anchoring people in history. In 2008, we were $44 billion of AUM. You fast forward. We've grown 14x. That's faster than Apple's revenue. That's faster than Microsoft's revenue. That's faster than semiconductors, truly extraordinary. I'd like to think that was all as a result of management acumen and management positioning, but we are the beneficiary of macro industry factors that drove not just us but our entire industry. Dodd-Frank; substantial money printing; for excess return in a low rate environment; and the commoditization of debt and equity markets, public markets, through indexation and correlation were the powerful tailwinds that drove our industry and allowed us to grow 14x. Some of these factors are still here, but I have to say the factors that are going to drive us going forward are different than the factors that in fact got us to 2023. As I think about the big drivers of our business, first, I think there is a fundamental rethink going on as to the difference between public and private. Most of us have grown up in an investment world where private was risky and public was safe. We had a private allocation, an alternatives bucket, illiquid allocation. And it was generally a relatively small portion of an institution or an individual's total strategic asset allocation and with good reason. Private, at least in the old days, was risky. Private equity, venture capital and hedge funds dominated the private bucket. On the other hand, public was perceived as safe. Stocks and bonds 60-40 portfolio world where public is both safe and risky and private is safe and risky; and the difference is only a matter of liquidity. I believe we are going to see a substantial pivot from institutions where they begin to think about private not just in a traditional alternatives context, but they think about private as just another investment that has a little less liquidity. And the question they'll be asking is, \"Am I being compensated for slightly less liquidity?\" I think that is nothing but a positive for our industry and for our firm. The second is this continued commoditization of public market returns. We are at an extreme of indexation and concentration and correlation. Not just between debt and equity markets, but so much of our equity market is dominated by a handful of companies that -- with outsized valuations and outsized PE that really do drive the public indices. While that's going up, that feels great. That can just as easily go in the other direction. Sophisticated investors, institutional and individual, understand this. And if they are seeking to separate themselves from the beta of the public markets and look for alpha, they will need to look for other solutions other than those in the public markets and through indexation. High net worth and the entry of individual investors into the private markets and alternatives. We are in the earliest early days of this. This hasn't even started. This is a $65 trillion market that ultimately has the potential for private markets investors such as ourselves and our peer group to be as large, if not larger than, our institutional market. For us to get there, it's going to take education. We are evangelical in this because what private investments can do for an investor's portfolio is well substantiated academically and through financial records, but the level of understanding of how private investments can be incorporated into these portfolios is very, very immature. I look at the largest pool of investable capital anywhere in the world, some $12 trillion in 401(k). These are the people in our country who need returns the most, and we force them to be daily liquid for 50 years. Why? I don't know why. I don't think there's a good reason why. And we're beginning to see cracks even in the 401(k) market of an allocation to private, which is different than an allocation to risk, but again I think this is a very powerful trend that bodes well for our firm and for our industry. Finally, that we're all getting older. Our society is getting older. Europe is getting older. Japan is getting older. Australia is getting older. Most Western markets are getting older. Most markets have done a very poor job of retirement savings. The retirement savings crisis in the U.S. is particularly acute. The numbers are well known. And I believe there is a substantial role for firms such as ours to play in [indiscernible] investor savings and allowing them to -- allowing us to provide them guaranteed lifetime income. In short, we find ourselves at $650 billion as a relatively small entity in the scheme of asset management, surrounded by 4 massive markets. The market for fixed income replacement. Think of this as a rotation institutions' and individuals' normal fixed income portfolios into private as well as public, so-called private investment grade. The second is the high net worth market, moving from traditional [indiscernible] 60-40 allocation into private market allocation. The third is rotations out of active management and into other products; and finally, the retirement market. Each of those markets offers us the opportunity to double our firm over a number of years. We just have to make sure that we are well positioned, that we make the investments today; and accept that the tailwinds that powered us to 2023 are not the same as the tailwinds that are likely to power us going forward, that the products that powered us to where we are, are not exactly the same as the products that are going to power us going forward. Fundamentally, we need to embrace change, but I like the position that we're starting from. We're starting from the only scaled player in private IG, a leading retirement services footprint, the largest hybrid ecosystem, all of which is fueled by origination, so what do we need to do? And what should you be looking for as milestones for whether in fact we are proceeding positively toward a path to take advantage of the opportunities that surround our industry and surround our firm? By far, the most important thing that we need to do is scale our origination. As you know, we have been running at roughly $100 billion of annual origination, $30 billion of which came in the fourth quarter. We need to rapidly move that up, with a goal of somewhere between $200 billion and $250 billion of origination 5 years from now. As an alternative firms that provides excess return per unit of risk, we can only grow as fast as we scale our capacity to create investments that in fact offer our clients excess return per unit of risk. If we grow too fast or simply seek to gather assets, we will commoditize our business, and ultimately we will not like the results of that, so origination, probably first and second. Capital formation. Not only do we need to continue to build out our high net worth coverage, but if we are going to serve fixed income replacement, so-called private investment grade, the sale, the way things are sold, the client base is actually completely different than the traditional client base of an alternatives firm. Building out a fixed income replacement sales force that speaks to clients in a language that they are used to speaking in [indiscernible] necessary ingredients to scale this and not just pick around the edges. Finally, new products and product creation are the heart of financial services. If I go back and look at the beginning of my 40-year career now: Levered loans, high-yield bonds, ETFs, securitized product either did not exist or in their infancy. We take for granted these 4 products as completely mainstream and dominant products, but we should not be naive to think that they are going to be the products that dominate 15 years from now. Clients and high-net-worth individuals are going to move out of public equities. I do not believe they are going to move into 10-year [indiscernible] private partnerships. I believe they're going to move into things that are more hybrid. Hybrid, again, is the midpoint between debt and equity.  [Indiscernible] to offer clients non-binary outcomes while still providing attractive rates of return. The product set here, while large for us, is immature for the entire industry. And I think you will see this year introductions of new products with risk-rewards and liquidity requirements and partnerships has not seen before [indiscernible] that we and our peer group are hard at work trying to meet the needs of our investors. And truthfully could not be more excited about where we sit in this ecosystem. We are beginning to talk about our original 5-year plan in hindsight. Martin and Scott will provide some context that we are well on our way and confident of meeting the objectives that we put up in our 5-year plan. We are spending 2024 positioning ourselves to take advantage of the next new trends [indiscernible] we'll be there going forward, but it will not look like [indiscernible] the growth of the past. It will come differently but no less -- I'm no less optimistic. Finally, we're looking forward to a full Investor Day, and with us you know the definition of full means long, in October of this year. And Martin and Noah will provide you details. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\nScott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc. Echoing Marc's sentiment. We entered 2023 focused squarely on executing the growth plan we set forth, and we achieved those goals. Both our asset management and retirement services business proved resilient and often opportunistic as we navigated an uncertain investing backdrop, a changing rate paradigm and an evolving financial ecosystem. One thing that stayed constant, though, was our commitment to delivering excess return per unit of risk for our clients. Investment performance across our product suite was strong, with particularly robust returns in certain yields and hybrid strategies. For example, our direct origination portfolio appreciated 20% over the full year, while our hybrid value portfolio, credit strategies and accord funds all returned more than 15% in 2023. In our PE business, our flagship fund performance remains very solid, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 32% and 22% net life to-date through year-end. Importantly, we've been able to generate these attractive returns while prioritizing senior secured investment grade credit quality and a \"purchase price matters\" investment philosophy. Off the back of this strong investment performance, we're seeing growing demand for our investment solutions in the marketplace. We raised $44 billion of third-party capital in 2023, an annual record when excluding flagship PE activity, reflecting the increasing breadth of our product suite. Athene's organic inflows continued to heights, totaling $63 billion in 2023, driven by strong secular tailwinds and leading market share. Approximately $23 billion or 35% of Athene's inflows were supported by continued growth through third-party sidecar capital. All together, organic inflows totaled $107 billion across the platform during the year. As we look to 2024, we expect momentum across all avenues of capital formation to continue. In our third-party asset management business, we expect to raise a record $50 billion of capital, including annual fundraising records from both the institutional and global wealth channels. Coupled with the $70 billion of expected inflows from Athene, we expect to raise approximately $120 billion of capital this year organically, which would represent an increase of 20% on a comparable basis excluding flagship PE. In a higher interest rate backdrop and with lingering impacts of the effect on traditional private equity allocations, institutional investor focus has pivoted to asset classes that offer current income, inflation protection and access to areas of secular growth, namely credit, infrastructure and sustainability. We believe we're well positioned to capture this demand with our direct lending, asset-backed finance, opportunistic credit and infrastructure equity strategies currently in the market in addition to our first-time clean transition equity fund. We're also focused on building upon the success we've had with third-party insurers last year, who entrusted us with $13 billion of capital, and view this as an important client segment as we continue to scale our third-party credit platform. Overall, we've entered 2024 with a lot of momentum and expect a very strong first quarter for institutional fundraising. Turning to global wealth. We closed out a transformative year for the business from launching new products, expanding distribution and educating the marketplace on the benefits of alternative assets. We raised over $8 billion of capital from this channel in 2023, up more than 30% from 2022 levels, and expect to grow off that base in 2024 despite not having a flagship private equity fund in the market. We believe our growing suite of semi-liquid perpetual products is important to that success, with a few to highlight in particular. We've seen steadily growing inflows for Apollo Debt Solutions, the nontraded BDC we manage, which totaled $875 million in the fourth quarter, in addition to approximately $345 million for January 1 subscriptions, a recent monthly record. These strong inflows follow industry-leading investment performance, with Class I shares delivering an approximate 16% net return for 2023; as well as expanding distribution, with ADS now live on 5 global wirehouse platforms and 60-plus selling agreements in place with independent advisers. Looking forward, we're focused on expanding our private credit offering from corporate direct lending to asset-backed finance, which we believe will provide global wealth investors more fulsome and diversified access to our proprietary asset origination capabilities. Additionally, we're pleased with the growth we've seen in AAA, our innovative core equity replacement vehicle. Inflows from global wealth investors totaled $1.5 billion in 2023, though weighted towards the second half of the year. Looking ahead, we're focused on expanding shelf space to additional key distributors in the U.S. and Europe as well as launching additional points of access to reach different parts of the retail market. And lastly, Apollo Infrastructure Company recently launched in November to capture growing demand for private infrastructure assets. We believe the company offers differentiated access to the full spectrum of our infra platform investing across sectors and the capital structure. Initial feedback from RIAs has been positive, so far, and AIC is on track to expand distribution more broadly over the course of this year. Turning to investment activity. We had an active year of capital deployment totaling approximately $150 billion in 2023. Looking forward, we expect many of the same themes that informed our investment pipeline last year to remain pertinent in 2024, a shrinking global banking industry, lack of public market liquidity and the need for structured financing alternatives, among others. With $58 billion of dry powder at year-end, we're well equipped to capitalize on this robust opportunity set. Relatedly, debt origination volume totaled almost $100 billion in 2023, as Marc said, including $30 billion in the fourth quarter alone. It's worth mentioning that about half of this volume in both the fourth quarter and full year originated from our ecosystem of 16 proprietary platforms. Over the next couple of years, we're focused on reaching our $150 billion debt target, origination debt target, that we first laid out at Investor Day. To reach that target, scaling our origination platform volume is essential and should encompass around 50% of that longer-term goal. We think we can achieve this platform volume goal by scaling our existing portfolio, especially through some of the larger platforms like Atlas and MidCap and mid-sized platforms like Wheels and . Importantly, growth in debt origination volume has helped fuel our capital solutions business. In 2023, more than 80% of capital solutions fees were debt related, up from only 55% in 2021. Our growing high-grade alpha business is one of the important contributors to this fee mix shift, which generated approximately $10 billion of volume over the full year. In the fourth quarter specifically, we announced 3 transactions with repeat borrowers, Air France, and Vonovia, showcasing the power of incumbency for large-scale structured investment-grade financing demand. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financials.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone. So as demonstrated by our results, 2023 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. We delivered on the financial targets that we laid out more than a year ago despite operating in a vastly different macro environment. In the asset management business, we achieved our 25% FRE growth target through fee revenue growth of more than 20%, coupled with decelerating expense growth, which drove the 200 basis points of margin expansion. In retirement services, we grew SRE by 26%. As Noah mentioned, you'll note a new presentation this quarter, on Page 10 of the earnings release, to separate SRE excluding notable items, which this quarter is $748 million or 141 basis points of net spread, from the difference between actual alts returns and the 11% long-term expectation, which this quarter is $132 million or 25 basis points of net spread. This change in presentation reflects both where the industry is moving to and is being required to move to, as a presentation format. Importantly, we still continue to manage the portfolio expecting the same 11% long-term returns. On this basis, our net spread, excluding notable items, for the year was 144 basis points. Considering our long-term expectations for alternatives returns, our net spread would be an additional 21 basis points higher and, combined, 30 basis points higher in 2023 versus 2022. Assisted by higher rates, this increase was driven by record organic growth, a favorable deployment backdrop and floating-rate income. With these strong results across the business, we expect to exceed our stated goal of doubling our total earnings to $5.5 billion by 2026. And we expect a mid-teens-plus compound earnings growth trajectory over the next few years. Executing on our plan for 2024 is the next important milestone to achieving that target. Before I get into the forward look, I'd like to discuss a few puts and takes in our fourth quarter results that will help form a better view of our run rate earnings power. On management fees: Management fees declined modestly quarter-over-quarter due to Fund X catch-up fees of approximately $25 million earned in the third quarter. Athene's alternatives portfolio returned 6.5% annualized in the fourth quarter, below our long-term expectation of 11%, with strong performance by the strategic origination platforms partially offset by other investments held outside AAA. Our operating tax rate benefited from large deductions related to employee stock compensation due to a higher share price as well as onetime benefits related to Athene's redomicile and new corporate tax legislation in December. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 20% over the long term, subject to quarterly variability. And then lastly, Athene's cost of funds in the third quarter included a 17 basis point benefit from 2 items that we previously adjusted out as notable items. Q4 also included the full year costs of a new performance fee, which amounted to 7 basis points of costs in Q4. Combining these items provides a more appropriate comparison of the quarter-over-quarter change in cost of funds, which including these adjustments was similar to the change in fixed income returns for the quarter. So turning to our FRE outlook. We expect 15% to 20% growth, as Marc communicated. I'll walk through the key building blocks. Excluding $45 million of cyclical catch-up fees we earned in 2023 related to our flagship PE fund raise Fund X, we expect low- to mid-teens fee revenue growth in 2024 primarily driven by increasing management fees and fee-related performance fees. We expect management fee growth to be supported by the $120 billion of total organic inflows Scott highlighted as well as solid levels of capital deployment, further supported by $46 billion of fee-eligible AUM not yet earning management fees. For capital solutions, we expect another strong year of fee revenue generation currently similar to 2023 levels. The revenue from this business has grown approximately 80% in 2 years and has already exceeded our 5-year target. For expenses, we estimate our growth rate in total fee-related expenses will moderate this year to a low double-digit level. We added approximately 350 people to our total head count in 2023, at the asset manager, with approximately half the net new hires located in North America and Europe and the other half in Mumbai. We expect very targeted head count growth this year in our business, with a continued focus on growing our India team. As the pace of growth in our head count declines, we should experience a commensurate favorable slowdown in the pace of non-comp expense growth. Combining this expense outlook with a solid revenue growth picture, we expect to derive an additional 100 basis points improvement in our FRE margin to approximately 57 basis points this year, on a path to 60%-plus by 2026. Moving to retirement services. We expect to generate low double-digit growth in SRE this year based on a few underlying criteria. In terms of basis, the growth outlook is built upon the exclusion of any notables and assumes an 11% return on Athene's alternatives portfolio in line with historical experience, adjusting for the approximate $70 million of excess earnings we earned in 2023 on assets related to the ADIP buydowns and the Venerable recapture, both as we previously communicated; of organic inflows funded with existing capital resources, including third-party sidecar capital; and net spread, excluding any notable items and assuming an 11% return [indiscernible], of between 160 and 165 basis points, based on the current forward rate curve which implies approximately 5 rate cuts by the end of 2024. As it relates to interest rates and sensitivity. Athene has had a long-standing and intentional allocation to floating-rate securities while remaining duration matched. Holding floaters has and will continue to serve a range of strategic purposes, including assisting with asset-liability matching, enabling offensive positioning within the asset portfolio during periods of market stress and cushioning it against any . With the prospect of a Fed easing cycle on the horizon, we have reduced the amount of net floating-rate assets to $25 billion at year-end; and we expect it to further decline to $20 billion by the end of the first quarter. Turning to principal investing briefly. We expect our PII earnings stream to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in 2024, with clear dependencies on both the public and private markets for monetizations and outcomes. On capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. We're focused on investing in our existing capabilities to drive continued organic growth rather than making strategic investments. We also expect to continue immunizing regular-way employee stock comp grants and to begin taking steps to reduce our share count to 600 million shares by the end of 2026. We have also announced an increase in the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.85 per share, beginning with the first quarter of 2024, implying a dividend yield of 1.8%, slightly above the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 of 1.5%. Finally, our GAAP earnings totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and $5.1 billion for the full year, retaining our eligibility for S&P 500 index inclusion. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today is coming from Bill Katz of TD Cowen.\nWilliam Katz: So Marc, a lot of really good big picture type of views as you sort of think through the new order here. One thing that I sort of picked up on your comments was the fact that you thought that there could be an opening in the 401(k) market. I'm just sort of wondering if you could expand your views there. And then maybe underneath that, can you talk a little bit about how you're sort of seeing the competitive landscape developing in the wealth management channel as everyone is sort of [indiscernible] position?\nMarc Rowan: So you are absolutely correct, Bill. I do see an opening in the 401(k) market. The 401(k) market is not limited by legal restriction. It's limited by a risk mentality as a result of substantial litigation over a long period of time, but I think we're seeing a stabilization, particularly as the set -- suite of private products is no longer all high fee, high carry, locked away in funds. You're watching the first baby steps as fiduciary managers in 401(k) begin to mix-in private into their heretofore public solutions simply to get better outcomes and better diversification. The other thing we're seeing is we're seeing a focus on guaranteed lifetime income or guaranteed income, where annuities are going into target date funds and for the same purpose.  I believe we're going to see a continued migration. I don't have the number in front of me, but my memory is kind of plus $1 billion this year in 401(k) and fiduciary retirement products. I think again we're at the very beginning of this, just like I feel we're at the very beginning of wealth. And I'll pivot to wealth: Much of what's happened in our industry, whether it is regulation, which has been a negative, or it's been the opening of the high net worth market, which has been a positive, has for the most part benefited the large multiproduct firms. To serve the wealth channel, to serve RIA channels, to serve a global market, this is not a small exercise. This is 150 people in the field, product, infrastructure. It does not make sense to do product but only if you are firmly committed in moving your business and you see a future of a multiproduct variety.  And so I think that there are a handful of firms who have a right to play in this market and have made the investment. It's not 2 and I don't think it's more than 10. This market is growing. We are at the infancy of it, and firms is kind of coming at this in their own way. I think there are good and bad that's being done. I'll just give you our way. We are focused on taking in money from this market not as quickly as we can but as quickly as we can deploy. Ultimately, producing good returns, not having extreme volatility, thinking long and hard about whether we offer this market binary outcome products, is how we're going to approach it. We want to position ourselves as the innovator in this marketplace rather than the largest in this marketplace, and I think we're -- we've made good progress in doing it. We have a lot of work to do, but I remain very optimistic.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: One small one, one big one, if I could. The small one is if you could dive into the return differential in alternatives of your 11% over time versus what you've actually been experiencing lately. You talk about good performance on the origination platforms. When I look at your performance across the board ex European Principal Finance, everything is really good, so I'm curious what's falling short within the Athene portfolio. And then the bigger...\nMarc Rowan: Let me hit that quickly. And then I -- we will not -- you -- I'll get -- you get your chance to ask the larger question, in violation of the operator's policy, but think of it -- so the easiest way to see it: AAA, which represents all the platforms and all the investments, basically was circa 10% this year, not quite the 11% that we hope for but generally good direction given that we are not focused on the kind of beta of the public markets and leverage the tech and AI and things like that. The difference between that and the Athene performance is a drag on certain insurance stakes. So Athene holds, outside of AAA, its investment in Challenger, its investment in Catalina, its investment in Venerable. We had less appreciation this year in those stakes versus the overall portfolio, and that's the difference, Bill. There's really no other differences of note.\nGlenn Schorr: All right, cool. And then my violation part B is you said $200 million to $250 billion. I kind of remember $100 billion to $150 billion, getting to $150 billion. I know you were at a $30 billion run rate and I know you bought Atlas but curious how you bridge that extended and larger origination scale...\nMarc Rowan: So we -- when we set out our 5-year targets a little over 2 years ago, we -- the 5-year target was to get to $150 billion of origination. I believe that we are -- and that would be \"2026.\" I believe that we are well on our way to achieving that target. $30 billion of run rate and really high-quality run rate in the fourth quarter was very encouraging. The plans for this year also call for continued tick-up in origination volumes. Origination is the lifeblood of our business. When we step back and we start thinking about the next 5 years, which would carry us 5 years from today, to power the business to where we want to be, if we want to serve the fixed income replacement market, essentially if we want to go to institutions and offer them private investment grade in place of their current fixed income allocation, we need to originate more. If we want to play a role in allowing high-net-worth investors and institutional investors to pivot out of active management of equity -- I believe they're going to pivot into hybrid. We need to originate more hybrid.  And fundamentally if we're going to grow our business, it is limited not so much by the amount of capital raised. And I respect that capital raising is a very important part of this. And sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's difficult, but in the long run, a firm that offers excess return, which all of the alternatives firms do, we are only as good as our capacity to generate investments that produce excess return per unit of risk. It is the lifeblood of our business. And we are very focused on moving past the $150 billion original 5-year goal and ramping that to as close to $250 billion, which I believe is a realistic target going out. More to come [indiscernible] in October of this year, at Investor Day, but this is job one and two for our firm to sustain growth, and truly for every firm, Bill.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: So Marc, just to build on that. You talked about origination being the lifeblood of the business fairly consistently for quite some time now, which all makes sense. As you look to grow the business further or scale and accelerate your origination capabilities, what sort of needs to happen for you guys to get to those numbers? Is it more coverage? Is it more boots on the ground? Is it more capital, which I guess some of that will come in through AAA? Is it more product? Is it more acquisition of origination platforms? So I'm just trying to kind of again think about what's within your control to really accelerate this growth further.\nMarc Rowan: So a -- some of it is more boots on the ground and building out what we call high-grade alpha or high-grade solutions. And that's been, as Scott highlighted, a very good business; and a very unique product for us; and one, quite frankly, that doesn't make a lot of sense across asset management unless you are both an agent and a principal. We built this business to power Athene. We then decided for good and valid reasons that we should be fully diversified, so we began to power third-party insurers because, after all, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing.  And now we also discover that institutions, as they are evaluating how to improve their performance in their traditionally public-only investment-grade bond portfolio, are willing to begin to move toward private, so long as it is at the same rating. This is happening with extraordinary speed in the conversation in the consulting world and with the innovators, and I believe it's going to continue to happen. In terms of where the volume comes from, yes, there will be more people with more coverage, but for us, we have 16 origination platforms. Only a couple of them are at scale. This is about growing the origination platforms. We are -- and I don't think we need a 17th, although that may , but that is not the goal.  We are not short opportunity. It's now about focus and execution and simply delivering. I mean, even a $20 billion origination platform or $22 billion, which is MidCap, it still has lots of room to grow. MidCap is way too U.S., just building out their European business, adding products. They have the capacity to double that business. Atlas has the capacity to double their business; , more than double their business. We have to actually scale what we have and execute, and we're doing it in a very supportive environment.  Recall that we are the beneficiary of regulatory choice around the globe where regulators have decided that they prefer more of the investment -- more of the debt capital in markets to come from the investor marketplace than from the banking system. That does not mean the banking system doesn't play a vital role or that it will shrink. It simply means that credit growth, which typically follows GDP -- I believe that much of that growth is going to occur in the investment marketplace. Some of that will in pure-beta products, investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds that we are just not all that interested in, but we're talking about a massively large market where we are, even at our size, a small participant. So I do the following math, Alex, it's helpful: We have a $500 billion private credit business today.  Somewhere between $150 billion and $200 billion of that is beta. For us to double our credit business, we have to . I like our chances of doing that over the next 5 years because the beta comes for free.\nScott Kleinman: The only thing I'd add there is the other 50% not coming from our platforms comes from the Apollo system. We've put enormous time and energy over the last 12, 18 months really driving the origination, linking our various business units to be able to drive the sourcing capabilities to provide more debt originations from all the relationships we have across the variety of our businesses, our equity businesses, our hybrid businesses, our infra businesses. And that -- we're seeing that start to really come into effect, so we're only in the early innings of fully tapping that from an origination capability, so -- and just a lot of momentum all around from all the different sources of origination.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research.\nMichael Davitt: My question is on the retirement services growth guide run rating at $80 billion in 4Q but guiding to $70 billion for 2024. So does that disconnect some restriction from available capital? Or are you just being conservative and the growth could actually continue to track from that higher 4Q run rate?\nMarc Rowan: I think you're hearing from us. In a week or 2, on the fixed income call, you'll hear from Jim Belardi. And if you look back in history, the team sitting in New York is a little more conservative than the team sitting out in , but I want to caution this is not just about volume. We can generate all the volume that we want. And I'm going to encourage you to really look into how people are generating volume. When you buy a secondary block of business, you're buying something that's degraded from a surrender charge point of view. I'm not sure that's good business. I'm not sure I can invest against that. I'm not sure I like the potential risk of that business. So we can do a victory lap by growing, but that's not the growth I want.  We can also do a victory lap by growing 3-year [indiscernible]. That's going to feel great this year and next year and the following year, but all I'm doing is setting up a cliff that is ultimately going to fall off. And I may not like the 3-year [indiscernible] years from now. We are focused on high-grading the business that we do. I would rather do $70 billion of business that $80 billion or $85 billion of business. And I think, while it is -- while many of you are learning this business, we've been living in this business for 15 years and the headlines are just not -- are not what they seem. And this gets also into the guidance on SRE. We had an unbelievable 2023. Jim Belardi and team, Grant Kvalheim and team, I hope they're listening. They should be doing victory laps. We actually did what we say we do.  We were not a current-period profit maximizer. We ended the year north of $12 billion of cash. We ended the year with a sizable treasury portfolio, which we almost never have. And we essentially high-graded the portfolio and built liquidity because we had already grown 25%. We have the opportunity, should Apollo, now the pressure is on Apollo, continue at the $30 billion-plus run rate of origination, to actually do what we want to do, which is deploy into investment-grade and yield-y private credit that locks in on a matched basis high spread. That will cushion a big chunk of what people would normally expect to fall off from rates. The other thing that happens rates up, rates down. In a rates up, we tend to go -- we tend to get a full benefit of it, but recall that, when rates are up, everything that we own is worth less. We lose flexibility in the portfolio. In a rates down, everything that we own is in gain position. We have massive flexibility in the portfolio. We have the ability to rotate out of investment-grade corporates and into originated private investment grade. The pressure is not on Jim Belardi and Grant. The pressure is on us. We have to originate more of what they need. And recall that they don't want 100% of what we originate. They want 25% of everything, so for us to really scale their business and scale our third-party business comes back to origination. We need to originate more.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Brown of KBW.\nMichael Brown: So the mantra for 2024, no new toys. How can we expect the capital allocation to progress over the next 2 or 3 years? And then specifically in 2024, any way to maybe put some guide rails around how the share buybacks could be utilized this year?\nMartin Kelly: Michael, it's Martin. I'll -- so I addressed some of this in the -- in my comments. I think the priorities in terms of allocation, for us, are to grow Athene. And the benefit of growing Athene, including with the , are numerous. And the earnings leverage from that is really beneficial; and some of which, we outlined at the Origination Day last October. It also grows AAA, all right, so that has a compounding impact on earnings. We want to -- we are -- as I mentioned, we don't see a lot of scope to invest in growing the business inorganically. And so that should be modest and very sort of targeted. We want to make sure that we're at least immunizing employee stock issuance, and so that's built into the plans. And then the ability to immunize and reduce the share count on a real basis is on realizations really. That's the delta. And so as realizations pick up, we'll have more flexibility to do that. And that really depends on what the markets -- what receptivity there is in the markets for exits, particularly in our private equity business. So that's how we sort of connect it all together. Whichever way you look at it, the returns -- the marginal return on a dollar of capital -- whether you're buying back stock or whether you're investing in Athene are both attractive, so they're both good choices, but that's how we try to balance it. But I would think, in terms of time frame, think of it as a 3-year plan, but we need more sort of near-term realizations to be leaning into that, so more back ended than front ended.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Martin, I'd like to maybe try and square your comments around the cost of funds in the fourth quarter and some of the adjustments you flagged to Slide 12. Is the one piece that's not one of the notable items the impact of the new performance fee? And given that performance fees are something I'd think you guys would be collecting on a regular basis, why is it that we should be adjusting that out? Can you please just maybe help us understand that impact a little bit more?\nMarc Rowan: So this is Marc. I'm going to give a conceptual and then Martin will address the specifics. If you look at history in our portfolio -- and this is not history of 1 year, but you look over 15 years. Then you say, where have the vast majority of losses come from in the investment portfolio? They've come from the corporate IG book, the thing that everyone thinks is safe. And if we're -- if you think of that as like most investors, a lot of that is based on rating and diversification and industry classifications. That no longer suffices. Athene has decided that it makes more sense to bonus the people who are managing portfolios for them, net of specific losses and net of specific impairments, which now include the corporate IG bond book. What we saw was it -- 100% of the charge for the change took place in 1 quarter, as opposed to spread over 4 quarters. Ultimately the belief is and the reason this was done is that this on a net basis should be a positive for Athene, but in the quarter it was taken, we're just calling it out so you know exactly why it was taken.\nMartin Kelly: I think my...\nMarc Rowan: Sorry...\nMartin Kelly: I would also connect it back to originations, all right? So it's a tool to incentivize appropriate originations on a risk-adjusted basis. And the math is pretty simple. The full charge of 7 bps was taken in 1 quarter, but think of it as an equivalent dollar amount performance-dependent taken over the course of the year. And if you adjust for that and the notables from Q3, you -- and look at the change in sort of top line fixed-income income and cost of funds, they're right on top of each other on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ben Budish of Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I was wondering if you can give an update on ADIP specifically and then maybe speak a little bit more generally about sidecars. You identified it, I think, last year as one of your kind of strategic priorities going forward, so maybe a little more color on how you expect that opportunity to evolve and what we should see this year.\nScott Kleinman: Sure. So fundraising, going quite well. We expect to wrap it up this summer in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, so providing Athene the sidecar capital necessary for the next probably 2 years. So feeling really good about that. Part of what we're doing is just a big education campaign, right? This is not necessarily an intuitive product to investors, but once folks start to understand it, it's a pretty exciting product.\nMarc Rowan: Yes. The color I would give in this -- and this is as you evaluate entering into this business. The reason we are successful raising sidecars -- and people buy into the business pro rata with Athene and actually pay both Athene and Apollo fees for the privilege of doing retirement services business. The reason this works is they, the investors, have seen us over a very long period of time stick to a mantra of high cash-on-cash returns. The ability to produce north of 15% cash-on-cash returns growth in book value over that period of time; and to step away from the market; and to step away from kinds of transactions that, while would give us growth, but -- are not fundamentally good transactions is why we're trusted with this capital. People will discover very quickly that this business done poorly is very capital intensive. This business done well is a great business, so I just step back to the big economics. It costs roughly $0.08 of capital for every dollar of growth. If you fund all $0.08 yourself -- you can do the math as to how big you get and how much capital you need. Roughly 2/3 of that $0.08 is funded by third parties who for -- pay us a fee for the privilege of funding because it offers excess return per unit of risk and they are aligned with us. And they know that we will be good stewards of their capital. If firms do not produce high rates of return and do not make fundamentally good strategic choices, they will not be trusted with sidecars; and that will be the difference between success and failure.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I wanted to ask more broadly on the retail annuities market with aging demographics and the need for income. I was hoping you could speak to the market growth that you expect from annuities over the next 5 to 10 years. And what sort of enhancements might you be able to make to the product set and overall customer experience to perhaps unlock some additional growth and expand the ?\nMarc Rowan: So the product set for annuities, if you look over a long period of time, has not evolved all that much. We entered the market [indiscernible] a decade ago. And the changes that we made to the product in the context of our industry we're very substantial but in the context of financial service is not all that substantial. We stripped down many of the unused [indiscernible] and we added it to rate and simplified the product and simplified the administration of the product, and it turns out consumers prefer more to less. That has allowed us, along with capital and good asset availability, to move from a new entrant to the market to the largest-ever year of annuity sales in 2023 and a leading market position. I think we will continue to see modest changes around the traditional product in terms of custom indices.  And because the product, as you know, is not a straightforward you get a set rate, you actually get a percentage of a market's index performance, subject to a floor; and investors like that mix of upside and downside. The holy grail of this business, in my opinion, is both simplification and a much simpler promise of guaranteed lifetime income. Currently firms taking one significant risk. That's investment risk. When you move to guaranteed lifetime income, you're taking both investment risk and longevity risk. We have elected, to date, not to take substantial amounts of longevity risk in our portfolio, but like any marketplace, there is the opportunity to work with market participants who are on the other side of the longevity bet to hedge out that risk. Right now the costs of hedging that out would not allow for the distribution of a product that neutralized longevity risk in a commercial sale, but in a fiduciary sale, one is -- that is not through a channel that is commission payable -- one could, in fact, offer guaranteed lifetime income and halve the costs of a longevity hedge borne by commission. I think you will see a number of firms in our industry trial that this year.  I think if we as an industry are successful in doing that, I think, we will open a different market and a market that is potentially very large and very attractive that provides long-term capital but leaves us as an industry participant focused on the risk we want to take, which is investment risk, rather than being in a longevity risk business. The other is we think of this mostly in a U.S. context. Europe, I believe, is going to step back and evaluate how they have focused on this industry. There's been a 40% drop in the availability of guaranteed income in European markets, primarily linked toward regulatory change. This problem is also in Australia, the most successful retirement market in the world in terms of superannuation. They've spent a lot of time thinking about accumulation but very little time thinking about decumulation. If you're interested, there's a treasury paper that's out talking about this. This is in Hong Kong. This is elsewhere in the world, so the ability to take what we've done in the U.S. and adjust for the local flavor and local regulation is one significant growth area. Growth in indices and the custom indices is another area. And finally, really cracking the code on guaranteed lifetime income, which is in its very early days, is a further potential growth area.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Finian O'Shea of Wells Fargo Securities -- actually, I -- apologies. It looks like we have reached our allotted time for questions. I'll turn it back to Mr. Noah Gunn for closing comments.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks for your help this morning, Donna. And thanks to everyone, for your interest and time this morning. If you have any questions or clarifications about anything discussed on today's call or our results, please feel free to reach out to us. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Scott Kleinman",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. Echoing Marc's sentiment. We entered 2023 focused squarely on executing the growth plan we set forth, and we achieved those goals. Both our asset management and retirement services business proved resilient and often opportunistic as we navigated an uncertain investing backdrop, a changing rate paradigm and an evolving financial ecosystem. One thing that stayed constant, though, was our commitment to delivering excess return per unit of risk for our clients. Investment performance across our product suite was strong, with particularly robust returns in certain yields and hybrid strategies. For example, our direct origination portfolio appreciated 20% over the full year, while our hybrid value portfolio, credit strategies and accord funds all returned more than 15% in 2023. In our PE business, our flagship fund performance remains very solid, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 32% and 22% net life to-date through year-end. Importantly, we've been able to generate these attractive returns while prioritizing senior secured investment grade credit quality and a \"purchase price matters\" investment philosophy. Off the back of this strong investment performance, we're seeing growing demand for our investment solutions in the marketplace. We raised $44 billion of third-party capital in 2023, an annual record when excluding flagship PE activity, reflecting the increasing breadth of our product suite. Athene's organic inflows continued to heights, totaling $63 billion in 2023, driven by strong secular tailwinds and leading market share. Approximately $23 billion or 35% of Athene's inflows were supported by continued growth through third-party sidecar capital. All together, organic inflows totaled $107 billion across the platform during the year. As we look to 2024, we expect momentum across all avenues of capital formation to continue. In our third-party asset management business, we expect to raise a record $50 billion of capital, including annual fundraising records from both the institutional and global wealth channels. Coupled with the $70 billion of expected inflows from Athene, we expect to raise approximately $120 billion of capital this year organically, which would represent an increase of 20% on a comparable basis excluding flagship PE. In a higher interest rate backdrop and with lingering impacts of the effect on traditional private equity allocations, institutional investor focus has pivoted to asset classes that offer current income, inflation protection and access to areas of secular growth, namely credit, infrastructure and sustainability. We believe we're well positioned to capture this demand with our direct lending, asset-backed finance, opportunistic credit and infrastructure equity strategies currently in the market in addition to our first-time clean transition equity fund. We're also focused on building upon the success we've had with third-party insurers last year, who entrusted us with $13 billion of capital, and view this as an important client segment as we continue to scale our third-party credit platform. Overall, we've entered 2024 with a lot of momentum and expect a very strong first quarter for institutional fundraising. Turning to global wealth. We closed out a transformative year for the business from launching new products, expanding distribution and educating the marketplace on the benefits of alternative assets. We raised over $8 billion of capital from this channel in 2023, up more than 30% from 2022 levels, and expect to grow off that base in 2024 despite not having a flagship private equity fund in the market. We believe our growing suite of semi-liquid perpetual products is important to that success, with a few to highlight in particular. We've seen steadily growing inflows for Apollo Debt Solutions, the nontraded BDC we manage, which totaled $875 million in the fourth quarter, in addition to approximately $345 million for January 1 subscriptions, a recent monthly record. These strong inflows follow industry-leading investment performance, with Class I shares delivering an approximate 16% net return for 2023; as well as expanding distribution, with ADS now live on 5 global wirehouse platforms and 60-plus selling agreements in place with independent advisers. Looking forward, we're focused on expanding our private credit offering from corporate direct lending to asset-backed finance, which we believe will provide global wealth investors more fulsome and diversified access to our proprietary asset origination capabilities. Additionally, we're pleased with the growth we've seen in AAA, our innovative core equity replacement vehicle. Inflows from global wealth investors totaled $1.5 billion in 2023, though weighted towards the second half of the year. Looking ahead, we're focused on expanding shelf space to additional key distributors in the U.S. and Europe as well as launching additional points of access to reach different parts of the retail market. And lastly, Apollo Infrastructure Company recently launched in November to capture growing demand for private infrastructure assets. We believe the company offers differentiated access to the full spectrum of our infra platform investing across sectors and the capital structure. Initial feedback from RIAs has been positive, so far, and AIC is on track to expand distribution more broadly over the course of this year. Turning to investment activity. We had an active year of capital deployment totaling approximately $150 billion in 2023. Looking forward, we expect many of the same themes that informed our investment pipeline last year to remain pertinent in 2024, a shrinking global banking industry, lack of public market liquidity and the need for structured financing alternatives, among others. With $58 billion of dry powder at year-end, we're well equipped to capitalize on this robust opportunity set. Relatedly, debt origination volume totaled almost $100 billion in 2023, as Marc said, including $30 billion in the fourth quarter alone. It's worth mentioning that about half of this volume in both the fourth quarter and full year originated from our ecosystem of 16 proprietary platforms. Over the next couple of years, we're focused on reaching our $150 billion debt target, origination debt target, that we first laid out at Investor Day. To reach that target, scaling our origination platform volume is essential and should encompass around 50% of that longer-term goal. We think we can achieve this platform volume goal by scaling our existing portfolio, especially through some of the larger platforms like Atlas and MidCap and mid-sized platforms like Wheels and . Importantly, growth in debt origination volume has helped fuel our capital solutions business. In 2023, more than 80% of capital solutions fees were debt related, up from only 55% in 2021. Our growing high-grade alpha business is one of the important contributors to this fee mix shift, which generated approximately $10 billion of volume over the full year. In the fourth quarter specifically, we announced 3 transactions with repeat borrowers, Air France, and Vonovia, showcasing the power of incumbency for large-scale structured investment-grade financing demand. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financials. The only thing I'd add there is the other 50% not coming from our platforms comes from the Apollo system. We've put enormous time and energy over the last 12, 18 months really driving the origination, linking our various business units to be able to drive the sourcing capabilities to provide more debt originations from all the relationships we have across the variety of our businesses, our equity businesses, our hybrid businesses, our infra businesses. And that -- we're seeing that start to really come into effect, so we're only in the early innings of fully tapping that from an origination capability, so -- and just a lot of momentum all around from all the different sources of origination. Sure. So fundraising, going quite well. We expect to wrap it up this summer in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, so providing Athene the sidecar capital necessary for the next probably 2 years. So feeling really good about that. Part of what we're doing is just a big education campaign, right? This is not necessarily an intuitive product to investors, but once folks start to understand it, it's a pretty exciting product."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone. So as demonstrated by our results, 2023 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. We delivered on the financial targets that we laid out more than a year ago despite operating in a vastly different macro environment. In the asset management business, we achieved our 25% FRE growth target through fee revenue growth of more than 20%, coupled with decelerating expense growth, which drove the 200 basis points of margin expansion. In retirement services, we grew SRE by 26%. As Noah mentioned, you'll note a new presentation this quarter, on Page 10 of the earnings release, to separate SRE excluding notable items, which this quarter is $748 million or 141 basis points of net spread, from the difference between actual alts returns and the 11% long-term expectation, which this quarter is $132 million or 25 basis points of net spread. This change in presentation reflects both where the industry is moving to and is being required to move to, as a presentation format. Importantly, we still continue to manage the portfolio expecting the same 11% long-term returns. On this basis, our net spread, excluding notable items, for the year was 144 basis points. Considering our long-term expectations for alternatives returns, our net spread would be an additional 21 basis points higher and, combined, 30 basis points higher in 2023 versus 2022. Assisted by higher rates, this increase was driven by record organic growth, a favorable deployment backdrop and floating-rate income. With these strong results across the business, we expect to exceed our stated goal of doubling our total earnings to $5.5 billion by 2026. And we expect a mid-teens-plus compound earnings growth trajectory over the next few years. Executing on our plan for 2024 is the next important milestone to achieving that target. Before I get into the forward look, I'd like to discuss a few puts and takes in our fourth quarter results that will help form a better view of our run rate earnings power. On management fees: Management fees declined modestly quarter-over-quarter due to Fund X catch-up fees of approximately $25 million earned in the third quarter. Athene's alternatives portfolio returned 6.5% annualized in the fourth quarter, below our long-term expectation of 11%, with strong performance by the strategic origination platforms partially offset by other investments held outside AAA. Our operating tax rate benefited from large deductions related to employee stock compensation due to a higher share price as well as onetime benefits related to Athene's redomicile and new corporate tax legislation in December. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 20% over the long term, subject to quarterly variability. And then lastly, Athene's cost of funds in the third quarter included a 17 basis point benefit from 2 items that we previously adjusted out as notable items. Q4 also included the full year costs of a new performance fee, which amounted to 7 basis points of costs in Q4. Combining these items provides a more appropriate comparison of the quarter-over-quarter change in cost of funds, which including these adjustments was similar to the change in fixed income returns for the quarter. So turning to our FRE outlook. We expect 15% to 20% growth, as Marc communicated. I'll walk through the key building blocks. Excluding $45 million of cyclical catch-up fees we earned in 2023 related to our flagship PE fund raise Fund X, we expect low- to mid-teens fee revenue growth in 2024 primarily driven by increasing management fees and fee-related performance fees. We expect management fee growth to be supported by the $120 billion of total organic inflows Scott highlighted as well as solid levels of capital deployment, further supported by $46 billion of fee-eligible AUM not yet earning management fees. For capital solutions, we expect another strong year of fee revenue generation currently similar to 2023 levels. The revenue from this business has grown approximately 80% in 2 years and has already exceeded our 5-year target. For expenses, we estimate our growth rate in total fee-related expenses will moderate this year to a low double-digit level. We added approximately 350 people to our total head count in 2023, at the asset manager, with approximately half the net new hires located in North America and Europe and the other half in Mumbai. We expect very targeted head count growth this year in our business, with a continued focus on growing our India team. As the pace of growth in our head count declines, we should experience a commensurate favorable slowdown in the pace of non-comp expense growth. Combining this expense outlook with a solid revenue growth picture, we expect to derive an additional 100 basis points improvement in our FRE margin to approximately 57 basis points this year, on a path to 60%-plus by 2026. Moving to retirement services. We expect to generate low double-digit growth in SRE this year based on a few underlying criteria. In terms of basis, the growth outlook is built upon the exclusion of any notables and assumes an 11% return on Athene's alternatives portfolio in line with historical experience, adjusting for the approximate $70 million of excess earnings we earned in 2023 on assets related to the ADIP buydowns and the Venerable recapture, both as we previously communicated; of organic inflows funded with existing capital resources, including third-party sidecar capital; and net spread, excluding any notable items and assuming an 11% return [indiscernible], of between 160 and 165 basis points, based on the current forward rate curve which implies approximately 5 rate cuts by the end of 2024. As it relates to interest rates and sensitivity. Athene has had a long-standing and intentional allocation to floating-rate securities while remaining duration matched. Holding floaters has and will continue to serve a range of strategic purposes, including assisting with asset-liability matching, enabling offensive positioning within the asset portfolio during periods of market stress and cushioning it against any . With the prospect of a Fed easing cycle on the horizon, we have reduced the amount of net floating-rate assets to $25 billion at year-end; and we expect it to further decline to $20 billion by the end of the first quarter. Turning to principal investing briefly. We expect our PII earnings stream to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in 2024, with clear dependencies on both the public and private markets for monetizations and outcomes. On capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. We're focused on investing in our existing capabilities to drive continued organic growth rather than making strategic investments. We also expect to continue immunizing regular-way employee stock comp grants and to begin taking steps to reduce our share count to 600 million shares by the end of 2026. We have also announced an increase in the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.85 per share, beginning with the first quarter of 2024, implying a dividend yield of 1.8%, slightly above the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 of 1.5%. Finally, our GAAP earnings totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and $5.1 billion for the full year, retaining our eligibility for S&P 500 index inclusion. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Michael, it's Martin. I'll -- so I addressed some of this in the -- in my comments. I think the priorities in terms of allocation, for us, are to grow Athene. And the benefit of growing Athene, including with the , are numerous. And the earnings leverage from that is really beneficial; and some of which, we outlined at the Origination Day last October. It also grows AAA, all right, so that has a compounding impact on earnings. We want to -- we are -- as I mentioned, we don't see a lot of scope to invest in growing the business inorganically. And so that should be modest and very sort of targeted. We want to make sure that we're at least immunizing employee stock issuance, and so that's built into the plans. And then the ability to immunize and reduce the share count on a real basis is on realizations really. That's the delta. And so as realizations pick up, we'll have more flexibility to do that. And that really depends on what the markets -- what receptivity there is in the markets for exits, particularly in our private equity business. So that's how we sort of connect it all together. Whichever way you look at it, the returns -- the marginal return on a dollar of capital -- whether you're buying back stock or whether you're investing in Athene are both attractive, so they're both good choices, but that's how we try to balance it. But I would think, in terms of time frame, think of it as a 3-year plan, but we need more sort of near-term realizations to be leaning into that, so more back ended than front ended. I think my... I would also connect it back to originations, all right? So it's a tool to incentivize appropriate originations on a risk-adjusted basis. And the math is pretty simple. The full charge of 7 bps was taken in 1 quarter, but think of it as an equivalent dollar amount performance-dependent taken over the course of the year. And if you adjust for that and the notables from Q3, you -- and look at the change in sort of top line fixed-income income and cost of funds, they're right on top of each other on a quarter-over-quarter basis."

            "content": "Thanks, Noah. And it's my pleasure to actually walk through what was a very strong year both in growth and execution. If you had told me at the beginning of the year that we were going to grow 25%-plus in FRE and 26% in SRE and that we would do that successfully, we would be doing a victory lap here; and I assure you we are, in fact, doing that victory lap. Those ranges, while I wish they were recurring every year, are not the normal expectation you should have for the business. We've consistently guided all of our investors to what I believe and we believe is a long-term growth rate in FRE, which is 15% to 20% in a non-flagship year; and to low double-digit growth in SRE. 2023 was truly exceptional. Recall that, particularly in our SRE segment in our retirement services segment, we are not a near-term profit maximizer. 2023 was extraordinary. We ended the year holding more than $12 billion of cash. We also used the very strong results to begin the creation of a countercyclical portfolio, which had us for the first time in a long time make a significant move into treasuries. While this costs us near-term SRE, it gives us flexibility to redeploy into very strong origination volumes, which you will hear about. In the third quarter, just -- excuse me. In the fourth quarter, just to highlight how strong originations volumes were, we did north of $30 billion of originations. We hope to continue up that pace. And having a pile of cash and a treasury portfolio will allow us to continue to grow SRE in the low double digits, which is what we seek to do. Away from earnings. Margins were up over 200 basis points. AUM hit a record $651 billion. Inflows were $160 billion. And Athene had record inflows of $66 billion. Even in inflows, Athene is not a near-term profit maximizer. This was an opportunity to really shape the kind of business and the kind of distribution that Athene wanted. And we would expect to exceed this number in terms of originations, organic originations, for Athene moving into 2024. 2024, we see as a year of continued momentum, but we also see it taking shape slightly differently than 2023. Credit, we believe, will dominate 2024. Growth at Athene and equity strategies other than PE. Martin will spend time in his remarks discussing the '24 outlook and the finer details of Q4. I thought what I would do is spend my time and provide a little bit of historical perspective and road map as to where we're going. We've just come back from our partners retreat, where all 201 Apollo partners get together and we discuss the outlook. And I began those remarks by anchoring people in history. In 2008, we were $44 billion of AUM. You fast forward. We've grown 14x. That's faster than Apple's revenue. That's faster than Microsoft's revenue. That's faster than semiconductors, truly extraordinary. I'd like to think that was all as a result of management acumen and management positioning, but we are the beneficiary of macro industry factors that drove not just us but our entire industry. Dodd-Frank; substantial money printing; for excess return in a low rate environment; and the commoditization of debt and equity markets, public markets, through indexation and correlation were the powerful tailwinds that drove our industry and allowed us to grow 14x. Some of these factors are still here, but I have to say the factors that are going to drive us going forward are different than the factors that in fact got us to 2023. As I think about the big drivers of our business, first, I think there is a fundamental rethink going on as to the difference between public and private. Most of us have grown up in an investment world where private was risky and public was safe. We had a private allocation, an alternatives bucket, illiquid allocation. And it was generally a relatively small portion of an institution or an individual's total strategic asset allocation and with good reason. Private, at least in the old days, was risky. Private equity, venture capital and hedge funds dominated the private bucket. On the other hand, public was perceived as safe. Stocks and bonds 60-40 portfolio world where public is both safe and risky and private is safe and risky; and the difference is only a matter of liquidity. I believe we are going to see a substantial pivot from institutions where they begin to think about private not just in a traditional alternatives context, but they think about private as just another investment that has a little less liquidity. And the question they'll be asking is, \"Am I being compensated for slightly less liquidity?\" I think that is nothing but a positive for our industry and for our firm. The second is this continued commoditization of public market returns. We are at an extreme of indexation and concentration and correlation. Not just between debt and equity markets, but so much of our equity market is dominated by a handful of companies that -- with outsized valuations and outsized PE that really do drive the public indices. While that's going up, that feels great. That can just as easily go in the other direction. Sophisticated investors, institutional and individual, understand this. And if they are seeking to separate themselves from the beta of the public markets and look for alpha, they will need to look for other solutions other than those in the public markets and through indexation. High net worth and the entry of individual investors into the private markets and alternatives. We are in the earliest early days of this. This hasn't even started. This is a $65 trillion market that ultimately has the potential for private markets investors such as ourselves and our peer group to be as large, if not larger than, our institutional market. For us to get there, it's going to take education. We are evangelical in this because what private investments can do for an investor's portfolio is well substantiated academically and through financial records, but the level of understanding of how private investments can be incorporated into these portfolios is very, very immature. I look at the largest pool of investable capital anywhere in the world, some $12 trillion in 401(k). These are the people in our country who need returns the most, and we force them to be daily liquid for 50 years. Why? I don't know why. I don't think there's a good reason why. And we're beginning to see cracks even in the 401(k) market of an allocation to private, which is different than an allocation to risk, but again I think this is a very powerful trend that bodes well for our firm and for our industry. Finally, that we're all getting older. Our society is getting older. Europe is getting older. Japan is getting older. Australia is getting older. Most Western markets are getting older. Most markets have done a very poor job of retirement savings. The retirement savings crisis in the U.S. is particularly acute. The numbers are well known. And I believe there is a substantial role for firms such as ours to play in [indiscernible] investor savings and allowing them to -- allowing us to provide them guaranteed lifetime income. In short, we find ourselves at $650 billion as a relatively small entity in the scheme of asset management, surrounded by 4 massive markets. The market for fixed income replacement. Think of this as a rotation institutions' and individuals' normal fixed income portfolios into private as well as public, so-called private investment grade. The second is the high net worth market, moving from traditional [indiscernible] 60-40 allocation into private market allocation. The third is rotations out of active management and into other products; and finally, the retirement market. Each of those markets offers us the opportunity to double our firm over a number of years. We just have to make sure that we are well positioned, that we make the investments today; and accept that the tailwinds that powered us to 2023 are not the same as the tailwinds that are likely to power us going forward, that the products that powered us to where we are, are not exactly the same as the products that are going to power us going forward. Fundamentally, we need to embrace change, but I like the position that we're starting from. We're starting from the only scaled player in private IG, a leading retirement services footprint, the largest hybrid ecosystem, all of which is fueled by origination, so what do we need to do? And what should you be looking for as milestones for whether in fact we are proceeding positively toward a path to take advantage of the opportunities that surround our industry and surround our firm? By far, the most important thing that we need to do is scale our origination. As you know, we have been running at roughly $100 billion of annual origination, $30 billion of which came in the fourth quarter. We need to rapidly move that up, with a goal of somewhere between $200 billion and $250 billion of origination 5 years from now. As an alternative firms that provides excess return per unit of risk, we can only grow as fast as we scale our capacity to create investments that in fact offer our clients excess return per unit of risk. If we grow too fast or simply seek to gather assets, we will commoditize our business, and ultimately we will not like the results of that, so origination, probably first and second. Capital formation. Not only do we need to continue to build out our high net worth coverage, but if we are going to serve fixed income replacement, so-called private investment grade, the sale, the way things are sold, the client base is actually completely different than the traditional client base of an alternatives firm. Building out a fixed income replacement sales force that speaks to clients in a language that they are used to speaking in [indiscernible] necessary ingredients to scale this and not just pick around the edges. Finally, new products and product creation are the heart of financial services. If I go back and look at the beginning of my 40-year career now: Levered loans, high-yield bonds, ETFs, securitized product either did not exist or in their infancy. We take for granted these 4 products as completely mainstream and dominant products, but we should not be naive to think that they are going to be the products that dominate 15 years from now. Clients and high-net-worth individuals are going to move out of public equities. I do not believe they are going to move into 10-year [indiscernible] private partnerships. I believe they're going to move into things that are more hybrid. Hybrid, again, is the midpoint between debt and equity.  [Indiscernible] to offer clients non-binary outcomes while still providing attractive rates of return. The product set here, while large for us, is immature for the entire industry. And I think you will see this year introductions of new products with risk-rewards and liquidity requirements and partnerships has not seen before [indiscernible] that we and our peer group are hard at work trying to meet the needs of our investors. And truthfully could not be more excited about where we sit in this ecosystem. We are beginning to talk about our original 5-year plan in hindsight. Martin and Scott will provide some context that we are well on our way and confident of meeting the objectives that we put up in our 5-year plan. We are spending 2024 positioning ourselves to take advantage of the next new trends [indiscernible] we'll be there going forward, but it will not look like [indiscernible] the growth of the past. It will come differently but no less -- I'm no less optimistic. Finally, we're looking forward to a full Investor Day, and with us you know the definition of full means long, in October of this year. And Martin and Noah will provide you details. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott. So you are absolutely correct, Bill. I do see an opening in the 401(k) market. The 401(k) market is not limited by legal restriction. It's limited by a risk mentality as a result of substantial litigation over a long period of time, but I think we're seeing a stabilization, particularly as the set -- suite of private products is no longer all high fee, high carry, locked away in funds. You're watching the first baby steps as fiduciary managers in 401(k) begin to mix-in private into their heretofore public solutions simply to get better outcomes and better diversification. The other thing we're seeing is we're seeing a focus on guaranteed lifetime income or guaranteed income, where annuities are going into target date funds and for the same purpose.  I believe we're going to see a continued migration. I don't have the number in front of me, but my memory is kind of plus $1 billion this year in 401(k) and fiduciary retirement products. I think again we're at the very beginning of this, just like I feel we're at the very beginning of wealth. And I'll pivot to wealth: Much of what's happened in our industry, whether it is regulation, which has been a negative, or it's been the opening of the high net worth market, which has been a positive, has for the most part benefited the large multiproduct firms. To serve the wealth channel, to serve RIA channels, to serve a global market, this is not a small exercise. This is 150 people in the field, product, infrastructure. It does not make sense to do product but only if you are firmly committed in moving your business and you see a future of a multiproduct variety.  And so I think that there are a handful of firms who have a right to play in this market and have made the investment. It's not 2 and I don't think it's more than 10. This market is growing. We are at the infancy of it, and firms is kind of coming at this in their own way. I think there are good and bad that's being done. I'll just give you our way. We are focused on taking in money from this market not as quickly as we can but as quickly as we can deploy. Ultimately, producing good returns, not having extreme volatility, thinking long and hard about whether we offer this market binary outcome products, is how we're going to approach it. We want to position ourselves as the innovator in this marketplace rather than the largest in this marketplace, and I think we're -- we've made good progress in doing it. We have a lot of work to do, but I remain very optimistic. Let me hit that quickly. And then I -- we will not -- you -- I'll get -- you get your chance to ask the larger question, in violation of the operator's policy, but think of it -- so the easiest way to see it: AAA, which represents all the platforms and all the investments, basically was circa 10% this year, not quite the 11% that we hope for but generally good direction given that we are not focused on the kind of beta of the public markets and leverage the tech and AI and things like that. The difference between that and the Athene performance is a drag on certain insurance stakes. So Athene holds, outside of AAA, its investment in Challenger, its investment in Catalina, its investment in Venerable. We had less appreciation this year in those stakes versus the overall portfolio, and that's the difference, Bill. There's really no other differences of note. So we -- when we set out our 5-year targets a little over 2 years ago, we -- the 5-year target was to get to $150 billion of origination. I believe that we are -- and that would be \"2026.\" I believe that we are well on our way to achieving that target. $30 billion of run rate and really high-quality run rate in the fourth quarter was very encouraging. The plans for this year also call for continued tick-up in origination volumes. Origination is the lifeblood of our business. When we step back and we start thinking about the next 5 years, which would carry us 5 years from today, to power the business to where we want to be, if we want to serve the fixed income replacement market, essentially if we want to go to institutions and offer them private investment grade in place of their current fixed income allocation, we need to originate more. If we want to play a role in allowing high-net-worth investors and institutional investors to pivot out of active management of equity -- I believe they're going to pivot into hybrid. We need to originate more hybrid.  And fundamentally if we're going to grow our business, it is limited not so much by the amount of capital raised. And I respect that capital raising is a very important part of this. And sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's difficult, but in the long run, a firm that offers excess return, which all of the alternatives firms do, we are only as good as our capacity to generate investments that produce excess return per unit of risk. It is the lifeblood of our business. And we are very focused on moving past the $150 billion original 5-year goal and ramping that to as close to $250 billion, which I believe is a realistic target going out. More to come [indiscernible] in October of this year, at Investor Day, but this is job one and two for our firm to sustain growth, and truly for every firm, Bill. So a -- some of it is more boots on the ground and building out what we call high-grade alpha or high-grade solutions. And that's been, as Scott highlighted, a very good business; and a very unique product for us; and one, quite frankly, that doesn't make a lot of sense across asset management unless you are both an agent and a principal. We built this business to power Athene. We then decided for good and valid reasons that we should be fully diversified, so we began to power third-party insurers because, after all, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing.  And now we also discover that institutions, as they are evaluating how to improve their performance in their traditionally public-only investment-grade bond portfolio, are willing to begin to move toward private, so long as it is at the same rating. This is happening with extraordinary speed in the conversation in the consulting world and with the innovators, and I believe it's going to continue to happen. In terms of where the volume comes from, yes, there will be more people with more coverage, but for us, we have 16 origination platforms. Only a couple of them are at scale. This is about growing the origination platforms. We are -- and I don't think we need a 17th, although that may , but that is not the goal.  We are not short opportunity. It's now about focus and execution and simply delivering. I mean, even a $20 billion origination platform or $22 billion, which is MidCap, it still has lots of room to grow. MidCap is way too U.S., just building out their European business, adding products. They have the capacity to double that business. Atlas has the capacity to double their business; , more than double their business. We have to actually scale what we have and execute, and we're doing it in a very supportive environment.  Recall that we are the beneficiary of regulatory choice around the globe where regulators have decided that they prefer more of the investment -- more of the debt capital in markets to come from the investor marketplace than from the banking system. That does not mean the banking system doesn't play a vital role or that it will shrink. It simply means that credit growth, which typically follows GDP -- I believe that much of that growth is going to occur in the investment marketplace. Some of that will in pure-beta products, investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds that we are just not all that interested in, but we're talking about a massively large market where we are, even at our size, a small participant. So I do the following math, Alex, it's helpful: We have a $500 billion private credit business today.  Somewhere between $150 billion and $200 billion of that is beta. For us to double our credit business, we have to . I like our chances of doing that over the next 5 years because the beta comes for free. I think you're hearing from us. In a week or 2, on the fixed income call, you'll hear from Jim Belardi. And if you look back in history, the team sitting in New York is a little more conservative than the team sitting out in , but I want to caution this is not just about volume. We can generate all the volume that we want. And I'm going to encourage you to really look into how people are generating volume. When you buy a secondary block of business, you're buying something that's degraded from a surrender charge point of view. I'm not sure that's good business. I'm not sure I can invest against that. I'm not sure I like the potential risk of that business. So we can do a victory lap by growing, but that's not the growth I want.  We can also do a victory lap by growing 3-year [indiscernible]. That's going to feel great this year and next year and the following year, but all I'm doing is setting up a cliff that is ultimately going to fall off. And I may not like the 3-year [indiscernible] years from now. We are focused on high-grading the business that we do. I would rather do $70 billion of business that $80 billion or $85 billion of business. And I think, while it is -- while many of you are learning this business, we've been living in this business for 15 years and the headlines are just not -- are not what they seem. And this gets also into the guidance on SRE. We had an unbelievable 2023. Jim Belardi and team, Grant Kvalheim and team, I hope they're listening. They should be doing victory laps. We actually did what we say we do.  We were not a current-period profit maximizer. We ended the year north of $12 billion of cash. We ended the year with a sizable treasury portfolio, which we almost never have. And we essentially high-graded the portfolio and built liquidity because we had already grown 25%. We have the opportunity, should Apollo, now the pressure is on Apollo, continue at the $30 billion-plus run rate of origination, to actually do what we want to do, which is deploy into investment-grade and yield-y private credit that locks in on a matched basis high spread. That will cushion a big chunk of what people would normally expect to fall off from rates. The other thing that happens rates up, rates down. In a rates up, we tend to go -- we tend to get a full benefit of it, but recall that, when rates are up, everything that we own is worth less. We lose flexibility in the portfolio. In a rates down, everything that we own is in gain position. We have massive flexibility in the portfolio. We have the ability to rotate out of investment-grade corporates and into originated private investment grade. The pressure is not on Jim Belardi and Grant. The pressure is on us. We have to originate more of what they need. And recall that they don't want 100% of what we originate. They want 25% of everything, so for us to really scale their business and scale our third-party business comes back to origination. We need to originate more. So this is Marc. I'm going to give a conceptual and then Martin will address the specifics. If you look at history in our portfolio -- and this is not history of 1 year, but you look over 15 years. Then you say, where have the vast majority of losses come from in the investment portfolio? They've come from the corporate IG book, the thing that everyone thinks is safe. And if we're -- if you think of that as like most investors, a lot of that is based on rating and diversification and industry classifications. That no longer suffices. Athene has decided that it makes more sense to bonus the people who are managing portfolios for them, net of specific losses and net of specific impairments, which now include the corporate IG bond book. What we saw was it -- 100% of the charge for the change took place in 1 quarter, as opposed to spread over 4 quarters. Ultimately the belief is and the reason this was done is that this on a net basis should be a positive for Athene, but in the quarter it was taken, we're just calling it out so you know exactly why it was taken. Sorry... Yes. The color I would give in this -- and this is as you evaluate entering into this business. The reason we are successful raising sidecars -- and people buy into the business pro rata with Athene and actually pay both Athene and Apollo fees for the privilege of doing retirement services business. The reason this works is they, the investors, have seen us over a very long period of time stick to a mantra of high cash-on-cash returns. The ability to produce north of 15% cash-on-cash returns growth in book value over that period of time; and to step away from the market; and to step away from kinds of transactions that, while would give us growth, but -- are not fundamentally good transactions is why we're trusted with this capital. People will discover very quickly that this business done poorly is very capital intensive. This business done well is a great business, so I just step back to the big economics. It costs roughly $0.08 of capital for every dollar of growth. If you fund all $0.08 yourself -- you can do the math as to how big you get and how much capital you need. Roughly 2/3 of that $0.08 is funded by third parties who for -- pay us a fee for the privilege of funding because it offers excess return per unit of risk and they are aligned with us. And they know that we will be good stewards of their capital. If firms do not produce high rates of return and do not make fundamentally good strategic choices, they will not be trusted with sidecars; and that will be the difference between success and failure. So the product set for annuities, if you look over a long period of time, has not evolved all that much. We entered the market [indiscernible] a decade ago. And the changes that we made to the product in the context of our industry we're very substantial but in the context of financial service is not all that substantial. We stripped down many of the unused [indiscernible] and we added it to rate and simplified the product and simplified the administration of the product, and it turns out consumers prefer more to less. That has allowed us, along with capital and good asset availability, to move from a new entrant to the market to the largest-ever year of annuity sales in 2023 and a leading market position. I think we will continue to see modest changes around the traditional product in terms of custom indices.  And because the product, as you know, is not a straightforward you get a set rate, you actually get a percentage of a market's index performance, subject to a floor; and investors like that mix of upside and downside. The holy grail of this business, in my opinion, is both simplification and a much simpler promise of guaranteed lifetime income. Currently firms taking one significant risk. That's investment risk. When you move to guaranteed lifetime income, you're taking both investment risk and longevity risk. We have elected, to date, not to take substantial amounts of longevity risk in our portfolio, but like any marketplace, there is the opportunity to work with market participants who are on the other side of the longevity bet to hedge out that risk. Right now the costs of hedging that out would not allow for the distribution of a product that neutralized longevity risk in a commercial sale, but in a fiduciary sale, one is -- that is not through a channel that is commission payable -- one could, in fact, offer guaranteed lifetime income and halve the costs of a longevity hedge borne by commission. I think you will see a number of firms in our industry trial that this year.  I think if we as an industry are successful in doing that, I think, we will open a different market and a market that is potentially very large and very attractive that provides long-term capital but leaves us as an industry participant focused on the risk we want to take, which is investment risk, rather than being in a longevity risk business. The other is we think of this mostly in a U.S. context. Europe, I believe, is going to step back and evaluate how they have focused on this industry. There's been a 40% drop in the availability of guaranteed income in European markets, primarily linked toward regulatory change. This problem is also in Australia, the most successful retirement market in the world in terms of superannuation. They've spent a lot of time thinking about accumulation but very little time thinking about decumulation. If you're interested, there's a treasury paper that's out talking about this. This is in Hong Kong. This is elsewhere in the world, so the ability to take what we've done in the U.S. and adjust for the local flavor and local regulation is one significant growth area. Growth in indices and the custom indices is another area. And finally, really cracking the code on guaranteed lifetime income, which is in its very early days, is a further potential growth area."

During today's discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode. And following management's prepared remarks, the conference call will be open for questions. Please limit yourself to one question, then rejoin the queue. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's Web site. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks, Donna, and welcome again everyone to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site. We reported strong third quarter financial results, which included record quarterly FRE of $472 million, or $0.77 per share, and record quarterly SRE of $873 million, or $1.43 per share. Together, these two earnings streams totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter, increasing more than 30% year-over-year and reflecting solid execution from both our asset management and retirement services businesses. Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion, or $1.71 per share, up 23% year-over-year.  Joining me this morning to discuss our results and strong relative positioning in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And one quick plug before we proceed. In a couple of weeks on the afternoon of November 14, we will be hosting a deep dive presentation on our platform origination strategy, a top area of investor focus, which will provide insights into various platforms in detail how, in aggregate, we believe they provide a competitive and sustainable advantage to Apollo in sourcing excess spread. A live video cast of this session will be available through our Investor Relations page. And with that, now back to our regularly scheduled earnings programming. Marc?\nMarc Rowan: Thanks, Noah, and good morning to all. Another great quarter amidst interesting financial markets and certainly a challenging year for many in our industry. Just to highlight performance; quarterly FRE up 29% year-over-year, quarterly SRE 36% year-over-year, margin expansion three quarters in a row now, inflows for the third quarter 33 billion, 125 billion year-to-date, deployment 36 billion, fundamentally momentum both sides of the business.  Our business model is very robust, as I will track for you. We expect another 30 billion plus/minus of inflows for Q4, bringing total inflows for the year to 150 billion. The momentum we see in the business tells me we will have an on track continued good performance heading into Q4. Obviously, a quarter is not done yet but everything we see tells us the momentum will continue.  In global wealth, which I'll just do a quick shout out to given how hard the team has been working, there are now seven perpetual wealth products in the market today. Scott will go through this in detail. And just to close out, origination volume tracking north of the 100 billion on an annualized level. Fundamentally, everything in the business is working and I believe we're set up appropriately to benefit from the current market. Almost everything in our business works better with higher rates.  Credit, as you know, is a much bigger part of our business mix than most of our peer group, something we've built over a long period of time. And as to remind you, we are focused on senior secured top of the capital structure. This is a big difference between what people normally think of as private credit and otherwise. But we want a business that last, one that has duration, one that is set up for a difficult economy, notwithstanding all the positives happening in the credit market.  To give you a sense, impairments at Athene at or below last year's level we expect for the year and the year-to-date, notwithstanding some back and forth quarter-to-quarter. Fundamentally, the book is in very good shape. On the equity side of our business, purchase price matters, which is our strategy, has really paid off. There's lots of dry powder in the equity business in private markets. But many people are sitting on the sidelines.  They have no idea how much of their existing capital is going to need to be used to solve problems in their existing portfolio to get refinancings done. Purchase price matter and being disciplined over the past decade has left us with a very small number of situations that will require fixing, and therefore we have been on offense, tremendous deployment, which Scott will detail in our private equity business and in our hybrid business.  If you like something now in the equity business, given all the geopolitical implications, given the concerns over recession, given the high-rate environment, given what is generally very difficult financing conditions, you really like it. On the margin deployment into the equity business, I think for all of '23 will prove for our industry to be very, very attractive. So what's really happening? Let me step back and give you my view at least on what I think is happening in markets and in private markets. And then I'll start -- I look at my career, which is now 39 years and I think we have benefited from four tailwinds over this period of time. We've had rates generally going from high to low. We have printed a massive amount of money. We have borrowed forward future demand through fiscal stimulus and fiscal borrowing. And we've had the benefit of globalization.  It does not surprise me with those four tailwinds that risk assets, equities, growth, real estate, things like that did really well. But I ask myself, are any of those four things true today? I think there's an argument as to whether there are headwinds or just the absence of tailwinds. But everything that I see tells me that looking backward is not likely to be a good indication of what needs to be done going forward for investment success, in particular, looking backward over the past 10 years, which I view as an absolute aberration, will not be a good guide going forward. And the strategies that performed over the past period of time with these tailwinds are not going to perform in the new environment that we have.  I also think there have been fundamental changes that have happened to markets and market structure over the past years as well, the most significant of which happened in 2008. 2008, we came very close to an absolute debacle in our financial system. The rules of how our financial markets work were fundamentally rewritten. We, not just Apollo but all of us, we just didn't notice. Because right after we changed the rules, we printed $8 trillion and everything went up into the right. Well, now that we are no longer doing that, now that rates are up, now that there are headwinds, we are starting to notice some of these changes, and I'll stick to three and I'll talk about their implications.  One is liquidity, public market liquidity. By some estimates, dealer capital, capital that facilitates trading, is roughly 10% today of what it was in 2008. Markets are 3x their size. That tells me we have just less liquidity in public markets. We have already seen the first complete breakdown of functioning in market, which was UK LDI last year. It will not surprise me going forward to see liquidity challenged, public markets challenged, and investors beginning to understand that liquidity only exists on the way up and does not exist on the way down, we should expect a more volatile, less liquid world in public markets.  The second is the role of banks, not just in our economy but in economies around the world. Dodd-Frank in theory was targeted at constraining the power of the four big banks in the U.S. following the financial crisis. But the banking system in general, guess what it worked? Banks today in the U.S. markets are roughly 20% of debt capital to consumers and businesses. All of you, investors, now supply 80% of debt capital to businesses.  In addition, the changes that are now proposed to occur following the debacle at SVB and First Republic and Credit Suisse will further lead to debanking. When regulators asked banks in the U.S. to put up 15% more capital, they're asking the banks to shrink or to shrink lines of business. When Europe moves from Basel III to Basel IV, they're asking banks to shrink. This is happening around the world. Debanking is not something that is periodic. It is at its very early infancy.  It does not mean that banking is a bad business. It does not mean the four big banks don't have amazing businesses. They do. But it means on the margin, they will continue to play less and less as a percentage of the total and new investors will play more and more. That tells me as investors that you will see over the next decade, a series of financial products that you've never seen before, because they have historically been resident-only on the balance sheets of large banks and they are on their way to you as investment product.  On the third, and what I focus on is this notion of indexation and correlation. 80% of volume today of trading is S&P 500, 60% of our markets are ETFs, 10 stocks make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500. These 10 stocks are responsible for 100% of year-to-date returns. These 10 stocks have traded between 52 and 44 PE over the last few weeks. Not many of you come in every day looking to buy 50 PE stocks, yet we feel really comfortable with a massive portion of our country's retirement system assets and fiduciary assets in 50 PE stocks. We have literally never had so much concentration in so few instruments since the NIFTY 50. Going back, it predates my career. But if one looks at the data from that period of time, a decade later, investors lost nearly 90% of their money. I'm not saying that's what's happening here. What I'm pointing out is we had this perception historically that public was safe and private was risky. I ask, is that even the right framework to think about how market\u2019s structured today? Is public safe and is private risky or are both public and private both risky and safe? I do think that that is the conclusion, and that's where investors will move to.  Let me dig in a little bit on private credit. Private credit is the flavor of the day in our industry. You can look at press mentions, you can look at all the articles, you can look at what our colleagues and peers have had to say on their various calls. Private credit for us has been the mainstay of our business. We are nearly 500 billion in private credit, away from the 2,600 people who work in Apollo Asset Management and the more than 2,000 people who work at Athene. There are 4,000 people at Apollo who do not carry an Apollo business card, who work at one of our 16 platforms that Noah referenced where we will do a deep dive, and their job every single day is to create credit, create private credit, which I'll come to. And that's what they come in and do every day. We've assembled this over the last decade plus for between $6 billion and $8 billion. Truthfully, our ecosystem is second to none in this business.  As I mentioned, I believe we are in the first inning or the infancy of private credit. Private credit is a secular trend and it follows the debanking that I mentioned, and it is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it is a worldwide phenomenon. We have to-date as a financial press and as an industry talked about private credit as if it meant to be levered lending, sometimes called direct lending, was private credit. Let me tell you, this is a fraction of a fraction of what debanking will produce.  This piece of the business of lending to buyout sponsors sometimes is a very good business. It is about to get commoditized. Lots of capital is coming to this area. There are low barriers to entry. And investors understand this. They are moving toward firms that have established ecosystems, that have long track records of risk and reward, that will not chase the hot dot in this market because yes, there will be a hot dot in this market as well.  When I talk about private credit, I'm really talking about the secular change as a result of debanking. I start with the notion that everything on a bank balance sheet is actually private credit. What we've seen so far and what the press has focused on is levered lending, which, as I said, is a fraction of a fraction. I think we're going to be talking about this for the next 10 years. And the vast, vast majority of what we're interested in private credit is actually investment grade. The difference between where we are today and where I think we will be is all about education and nomenclature. Investors are being asked really challenging questions today. Is a single A rated private security an alternative or fixed income? Sometimes I can stop a CIO at a big fund for an hour with that question. If it's an alternative because it is private and that's how they think about the world, they're not going to buy it because they need 15% and 20% rates of return out of their alternative bucket.  But if it is fixed income, because it is rated the same as fixed income and it offers 200 to 300 basis points of excess return for the same risk, institutional investors, family offices, wealthy individuals should be able to tolerate some degree of illiquidity if they're getting paid for it, particularly if I go back to my secular themes of liquidity is not so good in the public market. Most of what's out there has been commoditized. I do think this is our future. I do think we as a group will be talking about private credit, and I expect the conversation to become much, much more sophisticated.  Away from the business, I sometimes joke that we raise money, we invest money, and we compensate people. The raising of money, the investing of money seems to be in very good shape. I'm fortunate that Scott and Jim live and breathe this every single day. I, therefore, get to focus on compensating people. And it's not just compensating people. It's also about the culture. As I've said previously, our North Star is to build the best partnership in financial services.  If we can be the best place for our 200 partners to work, we will retain their judgment throughout their whole career. We will also send a message to our next generation of principals that partnership at Apollo is what it's all about. And then throughout the organization, younger people entering our firm no matter how hard they are working, and they are working hard and I thank you, you will have two amazing generations of mentors to teach you the business. This is the ecosystem that we're trying to create.  We also are trying to do something for shareholders. We understand that shareholders value more highly those things that are highly predictable, FRE and SRE, and value less highly those things that are volatile, PII. Just look at this year where FRE and SRE are up nearly 30% each and PII reflecting market conditions is down very significantly from what we would expect as a long run average. Our goal over time is to pay our people more PII and less FRE and SRE. And that is the trend we are on.  At our Investor Day some two years ago, we laid out a trajectory of how we're doing. Today, Martin will update you and tell you we are not only on that trajectory, we are now pivoting to actually exceed that trajectory. What Martin will detail for you is not just a financial transaction, but also focused on the next generation of leadership. We have, and as Martin will detail, decided to fundamentally change the compensation for four of our next generation of leaders. These are not the only leaders who in my view are capable of the next generation, but there are four who are very visible within our organization; Matt Nord, David Sambur, John Zito and Grant Kvalheim. All four of them have taken on increasing amounts of responsibility over the years. They now see not just to oversee their individual departments. They oversee massive pieces of our firm that are integrated. And as such, we've decided to compensate them substantially in stock. That does not necessarily mean more, it just means different.  What we've decided to do is to take the compensation of FRE and SRE and PII that they would have received and replace a very large portion of that with stock, so they are aligned with Jim and Scott and myself, but also with all of you. This will create room for us to further give that PII that those four individuals hold to others in our firm in our constant battle and our constant direction to keep more of the FRE and SRE for the house and less of the PII. And that I believe is how it should be.  Employees, particularly our partners, are well suited to understand PII and to bear the volatility of good and bad of PII. I believe this to be a good outcome for shareholders. I view it as a good outcome for me personally. And I know Jim and Scott view it as a good outcome for them, having everyone aligned and being paid in the same way, extraordinarily important. I will also tell you, we are committed to immunizing the stocks that we intend to grant and Martin will detail that for you as well.  So Noah is already tapping his watch and telling me that my time is almost up. Fundamentally, we are on track to hit our five-year plan. Athene, as you know, has already exceeded its five-year plan. Of the three big bets that we laid out, capital solutions in two years has already hit its five-year plan. Origination and global wealth are well on track to meet their five-year plan. So fundamentally, we're confident to meet or exceed the goals that we laid out in our first five-year plan. And it feels almost like it's time for the next update.  There are so many interesting things happening in asset management, so many interesting fundamental changes in market, and so we are committed to hosting our next Investor Day later in '24, which Noah will detail to really talk about where we go from here. With that, I'll remind you, the goal that we're after, deliver the targets that we've told you plus a little while maintaining our culture. We are not seeking to be the biggest. We're not seeking to be the fastest growing. We're seeking to build something that is sustainable over a very long period of time.  With that, I'm going to turn it over to Scott. \nScott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc. Unlike many in the industry, the current market backdrop, marked by higher interest rates, heightened volatility and economic uncertainty is where we thrive. It's good for our core investing businesses where we are asset selectors with a value orientation, not momentum or volume traders. It's also good for Athene's business where higher for longer rates drive more volume and better profitability.  And it can be good for our capital solutions business where companies can access creative financing solutions when traditional sources of capital are less plentiful. This is the true power of our aligned asset management and retirement services business model, which should only increase as we continue executing on our growth objectives. As you've heard us say before, the foundation of our business is providing excess return per unit of risk. And this is evident in our strong investment performance. In the yield business, our corporate credit, structured credit and direct origination strategies, all appreciated between 3% and 4% in the quarter and between 12% and 17% over the last 12 months. We've seen particularly strong performance in certain underlying strategies, including Apollo Debt Solutions, which posted a total net return of 16.5% for Class 1 shares over the last 12 months. Performance in our hybrid value franchise also remains robust, with the portfolio appreciating 4% in the third quarter and 11% year-to-date. And in private equity, our flagship strategy appreciated 3% in the third quarter and 16% over the last 12 months, including 22% LTM for Fund IX specifically, as the underlying portfolio companies continue to generate healthy earnings growth and are actively managing inflation by achieving greater operational efficiencies. The portfolio is well diversified and has an average purchase multiple of slightly over 6x, offering significant downside protection should economic conditions worsen. In terms of investing activity, we remained active during the quarter, putting 36 billion of capital to work across the platform. Investing activity across the yield platform accounted for the vast majority of capital deployment in the quarter as we continue to capitalize on two primary interrelated themes, global debanking and lack of public market liquidity. Our ability to provide scale capital solutions with flexibility and certainty has made us a lender of choice in today's backdrop. With that said, we're picking our spots and remaining highly disciplined in our underwriting criteria given the potential economic pressures of interest rates remaining higher for longer. This is the playbook we've used time and time again, strong defense during times of uncertainty, leading to effective offense during periods of dislocation. For our hybrid business, the pipeline of deployment opportunities is also expanding. Sponsors and corporates alike are seeking structured financing alternatives to access liquidity and refinance capital structures, which is driving heightened demand. This trend is especially evident within our hybrid value strategy, where the deployment pace in our second vintage has been strong, as well as our S3 business where we've invested more than $1 billion of capital into equity and hybrid solutions so far this year.  And in private equity, we remain very busy with capital deployment activity reaching $11 billion over the last 12 months. With reductions in broad market valuations, we're seeing a wider opportunity set that fits our strategy, particularly in take-privates and carve-out transactions. As a leading franchise with a longstanding track record, we remain confident in our ability to source financing, deploy capital, and appropriately capitalize during challenging market environments, which was recently showcased by the sizeable closings of Univar and Arconic in August. Moving to our capital raising results, we generated 33 billion of total inflows in the quarter, primarily comprised of the 13 billion of inflows from Athene and very strong third party fundraising of 14 billion. Investor preferences have shifted in favor of credit over the past year, and we've been capturing this demand through our full product suite, spanning corporate credit through total return and Apollo Debt Solutions, go anywhere opportunistic credit through Accord and Accord+, and our newly launched asset-backed finance franchise. All of these are important to our growth objectives in the yield business over the next 12 months and beyond, which will position us with even more dry powder for what we expect to be an attractive credit investing backdrop. Additionally, we spent a lot of time and resources positioning ourselves for the next wave of growth in our asset management business, which we've discussed is concentrated in six complementary areas where we believe we have a competitive edge. Fundraising for these initiatives accounted for more than 25% of total third party capital raised in the third quarter, including capital for direct origination and multi-credit sidecars and for AAA. We also expect to hold closes for our inaugural equity secondaries and clean transition equity funds over the next couple of quarters, which are two exciting areas of expansion within our equity business. And of course, an important component of our capital raising efforts this year and going forward is everything we're building in global wealth. This area continues to be a steady march for us as we roll out product, expand distribution, invest in technology, and continue to educate the marketplace. We believe all these components have led to a differentiated platform offering for several reasons. First, excess return. As I mentioned earlier, our primary goal is to drive excess return per unit of risk for our clients. Through our tailored product suite, individual investors get to the same sourcing and underwriting resources as our institutional clients and our own balance sheet. Second, customization. Individual investors consume product in a different way. To meet this need, we've taken institutional-like offerings and adjusted them into structures for the retail market, and in some cases designed products specifically with the individual investor in mind. We offer seven families of perpetual products today for both U.S. and non-U.S. global wealth investors and have a handful more in the pipeline.  Third, education. We believe the benefits that alternatives bring to a diversified portfolio are still widely misunderstood by retail investors, and are often equated with high risk, high fee products. To combat this mischaracterization, we've leaned in on education through Apollo Academy, which recently crossed the one-year mark and has more than 10,000 financial professionals registered as members. And lastly, commitment. As a leadership team, we've made an internal and external commitment to this initiative, which is translated into a couple of important benefits, including allocation of resources, both organically and via M&A, and with speed to market that has allowed us to grow as quickly as we have.  Despite all the progress we've made thus far, it's still early days and we see a long runway of growth ahead of us and what we view as a massive addressable market. Given our emerging growth prospects relative to more mature wealth platforms, we feel confident in our ability to drive this continued growth, even if faced with a more challenging retail market backdrop. Turning to Athene, organic inflows totaled 13 billion in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date inflows to 44 billion. Retail annuity sales drove half the quarterly activity with businesses that were -- with business that was underwritten to very strong returns. Volume has been increasing in that channel to begin the fourth quarter with approximately 2.5 billion of annuity sold in October.  In flow reinsurance, Athene is continuing to see a steady build in volumes driven by new distribution partnerships in Japan and the U.S., as well as strong volumes from existing counterparts. We expect flow reinsurance inflows to exceed 10 billion this year, implying healthy inflows again next quarter.  For pension group annuities, despite the low in activity in the third quarter, we see a solid pipeline of opportunities including one deal that already closed in October. It's worth noting that this business now has generated $50 billion of cumulative volume since Athene entered the channel in 2017, leading the industry during that timeframe. Based on the momentum we see across Athene's business, we remain on pace to generate 60 billion plus of total inflows this year.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financial results. \nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So as Marc previewed, we reported another very strong quarter of results as we continue to execute against the financial targets we laid out at the beginning of this year. Markets have changed quite significantly since then, marked by even higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty, yet we've remained confident throughout 2023 in meeting or exceeding our initial financial targets for the year, as further evidenced today. With these results, we believe that we're beginning to gain recognition for the predictability, consistency and differentiated growth of our earnings profile, anchored by our two primary earnings streams, FRE and SRE. I'll address five topics in my remarks today. One, earnings growth and outlook in our asset management business; two, the financial impact of the compensation awards we announced today; three, earnings growth and outlook in our retirement services business; four, credit performance in Athene's portfolio; and five, capital allocation priorities. Starting with our asset management business, our 7% increase in quarterly FRE continued to be driven by solid revenue growth and expense discipline. Year-to-date, FRE revenues are higher by 25% against a 21% increase in FRE expenses. Our capital solutions business achieved a new high in the third quarter amid a robust year of growth.  We're very pleased with the expansion of this business, which is on track to meet its five-year revenue plan in just two years. We'll spend some time during our platform origination presentation on November 14 discussing the breadth of this business, and it's important to our fixed income replacement strategy. Specific to Fund X in the quarter, management fee growth of 5% included a $24 million catch up for Fund X and its final close, with Fund X fees in the quarter being $14 million higher than the prior quarter considering catch ups in both quarters. Our focus on scaling the asset management business is evident in our compensation costs, which were flat in the quarter and up 14% on a year-to-date basis. Underpinning this is a moderation in our headcount growth and an emphasis on building our team in India, which recently crossed 500 employees or close to 20% of our total headcount. Our non-compensation costs are in their last year of sizeable growth, reflecting a step up in our investments in global real estate, technology and product distribution. Combined, this has driven strong positive operating leverage, resulting in more than 150 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date versus the prior year period. Based on our visibility into the fourth quarter, we remain confident in achieving 25% FRE growth in 2023, as previously communicated. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect FRE growth between 15% and 20%, consistent with our FRE growth expectations in a year without a flagship PE fundraise. The outcome is somewhat dependent on the environment with current expectations around the middle of that range.  This outlook is guided by a strong fundraising outlook, our holding more than $45 billion of uninvested capital with management fee potential. Our current plan to repeat the very successful year in capital solutions in 2023 and low double digit expense growth. We anticipate a further approximate 100 basis point improvement in our FRE margin next year as a result. The compensation awards we announced today amount to approximately $550 million of award value at grant, equating to approximately 1% of our share count and include two components. One, for senior leaders the exchange of the majority of existing and expected future compensation in the form of FRE, SRE, carry and stock for newly issued vested stock. And two, the reallocation of those savings and the expected issuance of a modest amount of additional carry to other employees and a further exchange for every in stock. This exchange and reallocation is accretive in value, and we expect will create an opportunity for a further reduction in our FRE compensation ratio which we currently believe will be around 23% by 2026 before further relocations. It will also create a reduction in stock that we expect would have otherwise been issued, and will increase our cycle average PII compensation ratio to an expected range of 65% to 75%, outcomes that we believe are well aligned with shareholders, as Marc described. Turning to our retirement services business, we generated SRE of $873 million in the third quarter or 168 basis points of net spread. This included some offsetting items that when adjusted for resulted in normalized SRE being roughly in line at $879 million.  In terms of balance sheet growth, net invested assets ended the quarter at $208 billion, down $6 billion versus the second quarter, reflecting the buy down by ADIP2 of $7 billion of organic inflows from the first half of the year and the $3 billion transaction with Venerable, more than offsetting positive net flows within the quarter.  Invested assets attributable to third party investors in ADIP now exceed $50 billion, representing 20% of Athene's total invested assets. As third party capital, ADIP has multiple benefits, including validating Athene's business model, providing capital support, driving greater profitability on business retained and enhancing AGM's overall group capital efficiency.  We expect to close out 2023 with a normalized SRE growth rate exceeding 30%, reflecting our expectations for strong organic inflows in the fourth quarter, a lower core outflow rate, ADIP growth participation and a normalized net spread of approximately 165 basis points in the fourth quarter.  As you are aware from comments we made when we issued the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August, and as evidenced by our retirement services business exceeding its five-year earnings target in two years, we have benefited both from meaningfully higher volume growth and asset returns. It is important to budget a continuation of that growth rate.  Having said that, we continue to expect low double digit normalized SRE growth in 2024 after adjusting for the ADIP buy down and Venerable recapture, driven by, one, continued scaling of asset growth due to an abundance of organic growth opportunities across our four business channels. Cumulatively, we expect that to be at least $70 billion in 2024.  Two, funding this growth with existing capital resources, including third party ADIP capital. And three, on spreads, expected non-normalized net spreads of around 165 basis points for the year assuming the current forward curve. And as a reminder, higher rates benefit our floating rate assets and achievable return on our underlying capital.  Athene supports every dollar of liability growth with approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of capital, which we invest alongside the dollars of cash taken in from policyholders. So while Athene continues to underwrite new business to historical targets of around 115 basis points or better at the product level, the on the margin SRE spread is much higher in the current environment closer to 170 basis points year-to-date.  As it relates to credit quality, Athene's portfolio continues to be in a very strong position. Total impairments over the last 12 months have amounted to just 13 basis points, close to Athene's long-term average. Athene's investment portfolio is concentrated in high quality senior secured assets with an approximate 95% allocation to fixed income, of which 95% or so is rated investment grade.  It's noteworthy that Athene's credit losses have been disproportionately concentrated in investment grade corporate bonds purchased in the market, as opposed to private investment grade credit that we originate, underscoring our confidence in the credit quality of originated credit. We believe that Athene has the most transparent financial disclosure amongst its peers. And in line with that philosophy, Athene began publishing historical credit losses in their fixed income investor presentation last quarter, which will be updated in conjunction with our next call next week on November 9.  As it relates to capital allocation, the construct we laid out two years ago at our Investor Day remains largely intact, with delays in exiting private equity investments impacting the timing, but not the expected quantum of carry to be generated. Meanwhile, Athene has been maintaining its consistent dividend up to the holding company in a significantly more attractive growth backdrop amid rising rates.  To support this we have increased participation from ADIP and issued the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August, the proceeds of which were downstream to Athene. At the same time, the sheer number of organic growth opportunities at the asset manager and a targeted 20% return on group capital by growing Athene has resulted in little need to invest in the business through M&A.  Balancing all these dynamics, we expect to continue immunizing all regularly equity-based compensation when it's issued. And we expect to immunize both the dilutive impacts of the mandatory convertible preferred and the vested stock awards we announced today over the next few years as capital is available, targeting a share count of 600 million shares outstanding. We anticipate additional capacity within our current five-year plan, but back ended to consider opportunistic for share repurchase in addition to.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I know early days, but could you address your view of the potential risks to your business from the new DOL rule published yesterday? And within that, remind us, if at all, how dependent Athene is on distributors that might be charging the \u201cjunk fees\u201d they're talking about? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. Thanks, Patrick. It's Marc. So what came out yesterday is not much different than what the industry saw seven years ago. Seven years ago, we and the rest of the industry prepared and actually made changes, extensive changes to how products and fees and features were disclosed. And so truthfully, not much new. In terms of your question on exposure of the business, about 10% of our business is through wholesalers. Another 10% is also to accounts but it's through banks that would have a very easy time adjusting to this because they essentially already charged that way anyway. So specifically, roughly 10% of the business is focused and not really worked up about it. This is where we were prepared to be seven years ago. And I think we're still a ways away from a final rule here anyway.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks very much. I wonder if we could just revisit two things that you said. You gave us good guidance or thought process on next year, so the 70 billion for next year. I'm curious if you could talk about that shift that we saw in the quarter, inflows into Athene were low because the shift over to ADIP. What should we expect of that 70 billion next year? And should we even be focused on it? Because I think in line with this DOL question, I think there's this notion that the retail flows are \u201chigher quality\u201d and some of the other funding agreements are stop gaps. But I wonder if you could talk to the quality of the four channels and if you debunk any of that, and how we should think about that shift going forward?\nMarc Rowan: Glenn, it's Marc. So we've been watching this for the last 14 years. Fundamentally, there is no difference in the quality of any of these four channels. We run a business around cost of funds. Sometimes various channels are attractive, sometimes other channels are attractive. What we're seeing is there's a fundamental demand, not just in the U.S., but everywhere in the world, for guaranteed income. People need retirement solutions. If you look at the vast pools of capital in the U.S., for instance, in 401(k), where there's $8 trillion to $10 trillion, we force people who need returns the most to be daily liquid for 50 years. What we're doing as a country makes little sense. And consumers know that. And so what they've done as soon as they have access to their funds, increasingly, they are in higher rate environments, seeking out guaranteed lifetime income. The demand we're seeing on annuities, either directly or through reinsurance is fundamental. Reinsurance, again, no different to us than direct business other than it tends to be in markets or in market segments we don't serve or don't serve yet. So I don't feel there is any difference one way or the other in the way these things go. As it relates to the broader question, we have a choice. We have a choice of the capital intensity of our business. If we want to be more capital intensive, we put up $0.08 to $0.10 of every dollar. And we retain 100% of the business. If we do that, SRE grows faster because we're retaining more business. And it grows faster because we tend to earn 15% year-in and year-out on the capital that we put up. Really good option. We have, as you know, made a business decision that on the margin, we tend to fund around a third, between 30% and 40%, depending on the mix of business and the regulatory source of the business of every new deal which means that we put up 30% to 40% of that 8% to 10% and that will alter the SRE growth rate. I think what we've said to you over the long term is that we expect the retirement services business to be a low mid double digit rate of return grower. At every quarter, Jim Belardi, Grant Kvalheim and team are embarrassing us. And this year, as you know, it's up 30%. What we're seeing this year is what Martin detailed. Not only are we seeing fundamental demand for guaranteed income, which is driven by secular trends like you and I getting older but we're also seeing widening spread. We are reluctant to budget increased spread of 160, 175 basis points, which is 30 to 50 basis points above what Athene has done historically. But if we continue to see the scale of debanking in the investment grade segments of the market, I think we will continue to put up spread, but that's -- the kinds of spreads we are, but that's not how we budget and that's not how we telegraph where we think we're going. We think the prudent thing is to budget the way we have historically and let the performance speak for itself.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Brown of KBW. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brown: Hi. Good morning. So I appreciate the commentary on the spreads within Athene. I guess one thing I was trying to think through is the higher short-term rates have been a meaningful tailwind for the earnings on the floating rate asset side. As we perhaps get closer to the end of the Feds rate hiking campaigns, are you thinking about taking any actions there to reduce that downside risk if short-term rates do start to come down? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: So we are plus minus 30 billion of net floating rate assets. If you look at the growth of the business over the next two or three years and you consider the mix of our liabilities, we will want to be two, three years from now 30 billion of net floating rate assets. Having said that, we probably are relative to our liability position 10 billion to 15 billion excess floating rate assets over what we would want to or consider a long-term prudent position. You should expect that we will take action over the near term to reduce the short-term mismatch reflecting that, and that's factored into everything that we've discussed with you today.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we could dig in a little bit more into some of the retail products you mentioned, which seem to have pretty good momentum here in the quarter, in particular AAA. I know the product is a bit complicated. So maybe give us sort of a breakdown of composition across various channels and sort of fee paying AUM between kind of third party and Athene as well as how kind of gross sales conversations are unfolding on that side of the channel? Thanks.\nMartin Kelly: Sure. So, on the AAA side, we've been actually very pleased at how sales are progressing there. So we had our best quarter yet, a little over $700 million in the last quarter for AAA. So week-by-week, month-by-month, we are getting AAA on to more selling platforms, more sales agreements. So progress is good there on the retail side. We expect this to continue grow up, as you know. The retail business is all about getting on to more platforms, more bankers, more selling agreements not only AAA but all our products, ADS, ARIS. This is how we are progressing. This is why in my prepared comments, I just talked about we're finishing up year two of our global wealth focus and we just see so much more positive momentum as we get these selling agreements signed up in place, product-by-product, area-by-area, region-by-region, just a huge opportunity. So really positive momentum across all the products we have in market right now. Like I said earlier, we have seven product families out there right now. We have a few more coming in 2024 where at that point we feel like we'll have a fairly complete line up across the asset classes. And so yes, good progress.\nMarc Rowan: So I'm just going to leave you with this following sense, Alex. What we're trying to do here is similar to what we're doing in the rest of the business. As you know, I've said publicly, certainly for high net worth families, family offices, I think they will be 50% plus alternatives over the next five years. And we're seeing that kind of uptake and traction. The difference between where we are and where I think we're going to be is only education. When we say we're on a platform, one of the big private banks, it may be 5% or 10% of the financial advisors. This is an education, an evangelical activity with more and more converts every day. And so if you take AAA, and I know you premised your question as a complex product, I'll make it an easier product. You can buy the S&P 500 at a 50 PE or you could buy roughly the same historical return at a much higher sharp ratio and give up liquidity. That is the choice we're actually seeing investors make. And while private markets are something that many on this call and we are very familiar with, the vast majority of investors thinking back over the 40 years, they've been doing just fine, owning the S&P and the 30-year treasury. And my point of starting where I started is I don't think with the absence of tailwinds, people are going to get the same performance. I don't think what I'm saying is all that controversial. We're now just in a period of education where people consider what does the market look like? How do I invest without tailwinds? What does it mean that public markets are less liquid on the way down? What does it mean to have debanking? What does it mean to have indexation and concentration? I believe when you look forward at asset management more generally over the next five years, I think you're going to see an asset management industry that is continuing to grow in its passive strategies. I think you will see boutiques who offer access to uncorrelated returns, or at least non-market correlated returns, such as ourselves and others grow. I think the tougher part of our industry, which you're already seeing is active management, harder and harder for active managers to produce good returns, certainly in fixed income. I question whether there's any alpha left in publicly traded fixed income markets. And given indexation and concentration, I think it's very, very difficult in equity markets. So I like where we sit. I like our hands of cards. It does not mean, again, we're going to be the biggest or the fastest growing. In the retail market, we want to be thought of as prudent and creative, growing our footprint every quarter, but not spiking it, taking too much money at a point in time to chase a hot strategy just makes no sense. It ultimately produces concentration risk, which some of our peers have seen by taking too much money at a point in time. Slow and steady, constant build is what we're seeking to do.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back to your commentary, Marc, on the DOL proposed rule. I was hoping you might be able to just elaborate a little bit on what aspects of the rule you find most troublesome for the business? And then what specific actions to products and features can be taken to address the rule? And then I think you mentioned about 10% of the business may be most impacted. I think it was in the wholesale channel. But what are other levers that you might be able to pull such as maybe altering the distribution strategy and maybe even thinking about going direct, because it doesn't change the overall demand side to your earlier point that retail investors still have a demand for income.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. So, look, it starts with investor demand for guaranteed lifetime income or guaranteed income is going up. And I think investors will ultimately seek out places to do that. Historically, products like annuities have been very complicated because they offer a variety of options and other things and therefore they have had more of a complex sell. Therefore, you have [ph] needed advice and that advice has therefore a more expensive distribution than something you can buy off the shelf. I remain skeptical on direct distribution. But I also see the proliferation of distribution. Increasingly, financial products like guaranteed income are being sold through the banking system, are being sold through RIAs. And if you focus in on the specific issue, these are not issues of the closure. They're actually not issues of product features. We and many in our industry have already made the changes going back seven years, because that was just best practice. I think there will be more pressure on fee. That clearly is what it's at. And we can have both sides of that. I'm not going to say it's good or bad. But I've watched in other places around the world where the focus has been on fee. Take Australia, you have the biggest or the best retirement system anywhere in the world, 3.5 trillion for 28 million of population. Well, they have a big problem there. They actually legislated out all the fees. So now there's no advice. No one provides advice. And so at 65, when people get their big lump sum distribution from the superannuation product, they don't know what to do with it, and people are dying between 35% and 40% of their retirement income intact. The government doesn't like that, because there's been no advice on what I'll call decumulation. How do you set yourself up to live through however long you're going to live given increasing life spans? Eventually, I believe we're going to come to a sensible place that may be lower fee and distribution. Truthfully, it doesn't bother me in the slightest bit, a small piece of the business. I don't think this is going to result in fundamental changes in distribution. I think it may change how product is priced, and that's okay.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to zoom in, Martin, on the FRE guidance, the 15% to 20% next year. For the higher end of that or getting close to the higher end of that, would it be capital markets or capital solutions fees is the biggest swing factor? And then if you could just comment on the trajectory of that, definitely certainly much better again this year than last year. And I think you're -- maybe if you can just confirm, I think your guidance was for flat solutions fees baked into that 15% to 20%. So maybe the trajectory of that and what drivers would increase the solutions fees a little bit faster?\nMartin Kelly: Great, Brian. So what I said is that's sort of current best estimate, obviously. And so we're focused on all the fundraising initiatives Scott raised. Putting money to work in an environment which we think is conducive to our investing orientation, and then continuing to build out the capital solutions business. And so any -- we've made assumptions around each of the three of them, any of them could be a plus or minus to the guidance I gave. And so we'll talk more about capital solutions on the 14th. That's one of the objectives of the day to connect that back to the origination strategy, and our fixed income, origination and distribution focus. But yes, in the comments I made, we are assuming it's flat. Is there upside? Potentially, but we're really, really happy with the growth of the business. A five-year plan in two years is pretty heroic. And so we're focused on building out that business further and repeating the success we've had. So with a primary emphasis on credit and then building it out to other -- to co-invest over time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan, please make sure your phone is not on mute.\nBrennan Hawken: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Sorry if this is a bit remedial, but cost of funds came down quarter-over-quarter. I don't know of another company in financial services where cost of funds came down. So could you maybe speak to what drove the lower cost of funds, whether or not there was any one-time items and how sustainable that is?\nMartin Kelly: Yes, we had -- you need to look at the normalized net spread. That's why we try to focus on the net of the two. There was a benefit in cost of funds for the quarter that we telegraphed last quarter related to the Venerable reinsurance transaction. And so that impacted cost of funds, which we then normalized out in the net spread. So I would look at the 165 basis points as the guide is our current best view and it takes account of things like that, the Arco buy down during the quarter, which are sort of episodic but not recurring.\nMarc Rowan: But I'm going to use this to make a point, which I've made previously. When you originate new product, you originate product that is protected by surrender charge, market value adjustment, or in the case of PRT is fully locked in. You should, therefore, be willing to have a higher cost of funds for fully protected product because you can invest against it. It gives you longevity. It gives you certainty. We have four different channels and we look at each of the four channels on a regular basis and we try to keep our cost of funds low because we know if we have a low cost of funds, if we're not good investors, we can earn spread. And if we're good investors, we can earn a lot of spread. What's happened in our market is you now have a number of entities who have seen what we have built and are late to the game. The way they intend to get into this business or trying to get into the business is to buy back books of business. Buying a back book of business with degraded surrender charge, integrated market value adjustments in a low rate environment may be sensible, because in a low rate environment, the contract rate is above the rate in the market, therefore you expect the book to behave predictably. But in the market we're in right now, for someone to buy a secondary book of business and pay for a cost of funds in excess of that of retail kind of tells you all you need to know about the quality of the business that people are buying. And I encourage you to push as hard on cost of funds across the board. It ultimately simplifies what is a very complex business. We're in the spread business. Having low cost of funds is really important.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ben Budish of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Budish: Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the old return of the Athene business, it's been below the sort of normalized 11% for several quarters. Anything in particular to call out there? I know we always spend some time trying to triangulate what it might look like and there's many kinds of components to that. Any color on sort of the key drivers over the past year or so. And what do you think might get that back to sort of the normalized expectation going forward? Thanks.\nMarc Rowan: Sure. As you know, the old portfolio is made up of 150 different positions, about half of which relates to our origination platforms, about a third -- the remaining quarter is about funds and other I would say hybrid type products. And then the last quarter would be other bespoke and direct investments. Overall, we still look at that portfolio as being, call it, 12% plus the last couple quarters. Given the environment, there's been a little bit of slower appreciation, as you've just seen in the broader market, but really no fundamental concerns there about what's in that. As we've always said, that portfolio will sort of deliver you 8 in a really bad year, 18 in a really good year and 12 to 15 expected. And we see nothing deviating from that.\nOperator: Thank you. This brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I will turn it back over to Mr. Gunn for closing comments.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks for your help this morning, Donna, and thanks again everyone for joining the call. Just a couple of reminders. We would encourage you to participate in Athene's fixed income investor call next Thursday, November 9, and then our origination deep dive that we mentioned on November 14. If you have any questions regarding anything discussed on today's call, as usual, please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your line or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Scott Kleinman",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. Unlike many in the industry, the current market backdrop, marked by higher interest rates, heightened volatility and economic uncertainty is where we thrive. It's good for our core investing businesses where we are asset selectors with a value orientation, not momentum or volume traders. It's also good for Athene's business where higher for longer rates drive more volume and better profitability.  And it can be good for our capital solutions business where companies can access creative financing solutions when traditional sources of capital are less plentiful. This is the true power of our aligned asset management and retirement services business model, which should only increase as we continue executing on our growth objectives. As you've heard us say before, the foundation of our business is providing excess return per unit of risk. And this is evident in our strong investment performance. In the yield business, our corporate credit, structured credit and direct origination strategies, all appreciated between 3% and 4% in the quarter and between 12% and 17% over the last 12 months. We've seen particularly strong performance in certain underlying strategies, including Apollo Debt Solutions, which posted a total net return of 16.5% for Class 1 shares over the last 12 months. Performance in our hybrid value franchise also remains robust, with the portfolio appreciating 4% in the third quarter and 11% year-to-date. And in private equity, our flagship strategy appreciated 3% in the third quarter and 16% over the last 12 months, including 22% LTM for Fund IX specifically, as the underlying portfolio companies continue to generate healthy earnings growth and are actively managing inflation by achieving greater operational efficiencies. The portfolio is well diversified and has an average purchase multiple of slightly over 6x, offering significant downside protection should economic conditions worsen. In terms of investing activity, we remained active during the quarter, putting 36 billion of capital to work across the platform. Investing activity across the yield platform accounted for the vast majority of capital deployment in the quarter as we continue to capitalize on two primary interrelated themes, global debanking and lack of public market liquidity. Our ability to provide scale capital solutions with flexibility and certainty has made us a lender of choice in today's backdrop. With that said, we're picking our spots and remaining highly disciplined in our underwriting criteria given the potential economic pressures of interest rates remaining higher for longer. This is the playbook we've used time and time again, strong defense during times of uncertainty, leading to effective offense during periods of dislocation. For our hybrid business, the pipeline of deployment opportunities is also expanding. Sponsors and corporates alike are seeking structured financing alternatives to access liquidity and refinance capital structures, which is driving heightened demand. This trend is especially evident within our hybrid value strategy, where the deployment pace in our second vintage has been strong, as well as our S3 business where we've invested more than $1 billion of capital into equity and hybrid solutions so far this year.  And in private equity, we remain very busy with capital deployment activity reaching $11 billion over the last 12 months. With reductions in broad market valuations, we're seeing a wider opportunity set that fits our strategy, particularly in take-privates and carve-out transactions. As a leading franchise with a longstanding track record, we remain confident in our ability to source financing, deploy capital, and appropriately capitalize during challenging market environments, which was recently showcased by the sizeable closings of Univar and Arconic in August. Moving to our capital raising results, we generated 33 billion of total inflows in the quarter, primarily comprised of the 13 billion of inflows from Athene and very strong third party fundraising of 14 billion. Investor preferences have shifted in favor of credit over the past year, and we've been capturing this demand through our full product suite, spanning corporate credit through total return and Apollo Debt Solutions, go anywhere opportunistic credit through Accord and Accord+, and our newly launched asset-backed finance franchise. All of these are important to our growth objectives in the yield business over the next 12 months and beyond, which will position us with even more dry powder for what we expect to be an attractive credit investing backdrop. Additionally, we spent a lot of time and resources positioning ourselves for the next wave of growth in our asset management business, which we've discussed is concentrated in six complementary areas where we believe we have a competitive edge. Fundraising for these initiatives accounted for more than 25% of total third party capital raised in the third quarter, including capital for direct origination and multi-credit sidecars and for AAA. We also expect to hold closes for our inaugural equity secondaries and clean transition equity funds over the next couple of quarters, which are two exciting areas of expansion within our equity business. And of course, an important component of our capital raising efforts this year and going forward is everything we're building in global wealth. This area continues to be a steady march for us as we roll out product, expand distribution, invest in technology, and continue to educate the marketplace. We believe all these components have led to a differentiated platform offering for several reasons. First, excess return. As I mentioned earlier, our primary goal is to drive excess return per unit of risk for our clients. Through our tailored product suite, individual investors get to the same sourcing and underwriting resources as our institutional clients and our own balance sheet. Second, customization. Individual investors consume product in a different way. To meet this need, we've taken institutional-like offerings and adjusted them into structures for the retail market, and in some cases designed products specifically with the individual investor in mind. We offer seven families of perpetual products today for both U.S. and non-U.S. global wealth investors and have a handful more in the pipeline.  Third, education. We believe the benefits that alternatives bring to a diversified portfolio are still widely misunderstood by retail investors, and are often equated with high risk, high fee products. To combat this mischaracterization, we've leaned in on education through Apollo Academy, which recently crossed the one-year mark and has more than 10,000 financial professionals registered as members. And lastly, commitment. As a leadership team, we've made an internal and external commitment to this initiative, which is translated into a couple of important benefits, including allocation of resources, both organically and via M&A, and with speed to market that has allowed us to grow as quickly as we have.  Despite all the progress we've made thus far, it's still early days and we see a long runway of growth ahead of us and what we view as a massive addressable market. Given our emerging growth prospects relative to more mature wealth platforms, we feel confident in our ability to drive this continued growth, even if faced with a more challenging retail market backdrop. Turning to Athene, organic inflows totaled 13 billion in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date inflows to 44 billion. Retail annuity sales drove half the quarterly activity with businesses that were -- with business that was underwritten to very strong returns. Volume has been increasing in that channel to begin the fourth quarter with approximately 2.5 billion of annuity sold in October.  In flow reinsurance, Athene is continuing to see a steady build in volumes driven by new distribution partnerships in Japan and the U.S., as well as strong volumes from existing counterparts. We expect flow reinsurance inflows to exceed 10 billion this year, implying healthy inflows again next quarter.  For pension group annuities, despite the low in activity in the third quarter, we see a solid pipeline of opportunities including one deal that already closed in October. It's worth noting that this business now has generated $50 billion of cumulative volume since Athene entered the channel in 2017, leading the industry during that timeframe. Based on the momentum we see across Athene's business, we remain on pace to generate 60 billion plus of total inflows this year.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financial results."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So as Marc previewed, we reported another very strong quarter of results as we continue to execute against the financial targets we laid out at the beginning of this year. Markets have changed quite significantly since then, marked by even higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty, yet we've remained confident throughout 2023 in meeting or exceeding our initial financial targets for the year, as further evidenced today. With these results, we believe that we're beginning to gain recognition for the predictability, consistency and differentiated growth of our earnings profile, anchored by our two primary earnings streams, FRE and SRE. I'll address five topics in my remarks today. One, earnings growth and outlook in our asset management business; two, the financial impact of the compensation awards we announced today; three, earnings growth and outlook in our retirement services business; four, credit performance in Athene's portfolio; and five, capital allocation priorities. Starting with our asset management business, our 7% increase in quarterly FRE continued to be driven by solid revenue growth and expense discipline. Year-to-date, FRE revenues are higher by 25% against a 21% increase in FRE expenses. Our capital solutions business achieved a new high in the third quarter amid a robust year of growth.  We're very pleased with the expansion of this business, which is on track to meet its five-year revenue plan in just two years. We'll spend some time during our platform origination presentation on November 14 discussing the breadth of this business, and it's important to our fixed income replacement strategy. Specific to Fund X in the quarter, management fee growth of 5% included a $24 million catch up for Fund X and its final close, with Fund X fees in the quarter being $14 million higher than the prior quarter considering catch ups in both quarters. Our focus on scaling the asset management business is evident in our compensation costs, which were flat in the quarter and up 14% on a year-to-date basis. Underpinning this is a moderation in our headcount growth and an emphasis on building our team in India, which recently crossed 500 employees or close to 20% of our total headcount. Our non-compensation costs are in their last year of sizeable growth, reflecting a step up in our investments in global real estate, technology and product distribution. Combined, this has driven strong positive operating leverage, resulting in more than 150 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date versus the prior year period. Based on our visibility into the fourth quarter, we remain confident in achieving 25% FRE growth in 2023, as previously communicated. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect FRE growth between 15% and 20%, consistent with our FRE growth expectations in a year without a flagship PE fundraise. The outcome is somewhat dependent on the environment with current expectations around the middle of that range.  This outlook is guided by a strong fundraising outlook, our holding more than $45 billion of uninvested capital with management fee potential. Our current plan to repeat the very successful year in capital solutions in 2023 and low double digit expense growth. We anticipate a further approximate 100 basis point improvement in our FRE margin next year as a result. The compensation awards we announced today amount to approximately $550 million of award value at grant, equating to approximately 1% of our share count and include two components. One, for senior leaders the exchange of the majority of existing and expected future compensation in the form of FRE, SRE, carry and stock for newly issued vested stock. And two, the reallocation of those savings and the expected issuance of a modest amount of additional carry to other employees and a further exchange for every in stock. This exchange and reallocation is accretive in value, and we expect will create an opportunity for a further reduction in our FRE compensation ratio which we currently believe will be around 23% by 2026 before further relocations. It will also create a reduction in stock that we expect would have otherwise been issued, and will increase our cycle average PII compensation ratio to an expected range of 65% to 75%, outcomes that we believe are well aligned with shareholders, as Marc described. Turning to our retirement services business, we generated SRE of $873 million in the third quarter or 168 basis points of net spread. This included some offsetting items that when adjusted for resulted in normalized SRE being roughly in line at $879 million.  In terms of balance sheet growth, net invested assets ended the quarter at $208 billion, down $6 billion versus the second quarter, reflecting the buy down by ADIP2 of $7 billion of organic inflows from the first half of the year and the $3 billion transaction with Venerable, more than offsetting positive net flows within the quarter.  Invested assets attributable to third party investors in ADIP now exceed $50 billion, representing 20% of Athene's total invested assets. As third party capital, ADIP has multiple benefits, including validating Athene's business model, providing capital support, driving greater profitability on business retained and enhancing AGM's overall group capital efficiency.  We expect to close out 2023 with a normalized SRE growth rate exceeding 30%, reflecting our expectations for strong organic inflows in the fourth quarter, a lower core outflow rate, ADIP growth participation and a normalized net spread of approximately 165 basis points in the fourth quarter.  As you are aware from comments we made when we issued the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August, and as evidenced by our retirement services business exceeding its five-year earnings target in two years, we have benefited both from meaningfully higher volume growth and asset returns. It is important to budget a continuation of that growth rate.  Having said that, we continue to expect low double digit normalized SRE growth in 2024 after adjusting for the ADIP buy down and Venerable recapture, driven by, one, continued scaling of asset growth due to an abundance of organic growth opportunities across our four business channels. Cumulatively, we expect that to be at least $70 billion in 2024.  Two, funding this growth with existing capital resources, including third party ADIP capital. And three, on spreads, expected non-normalized net spreads of around 165 basis points for the year assuming the current forward curve. And as a reminder, higher rates benefit our floating rate assets and achievable return on our underlying capital.  Athene supports every dollar of liability growth with approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of capital, which we invest alongside the dollars of cash taken in from policyholders. So while Athene continues to underwrite new business to historical targets of around 115 basis points or better at the product level, the on the margin SRE spread is much higher in the current environment closer to 170 basis points year-to-date.  As it relates to credit quality, Athene's portfolio continues to be in a very strong position. Total impairments over the last 12 months have amounted to just 13 basis points, close to Athene's long-term average. Athene's investment portfolio is concentrated in high quality senior secured assets with an approximate 95% allocation to fixed income, of which 95% or so is rated investment grade.  It's noteworthy that Athene's credit losses have been disproportionately concentrated in investment grade corporate bonds purchased in the market, as opposed to private investment grade credit that we originate, underscoring our confidence in the credit quality of originated credit. We believe that Athene has the most transparent financial disclosure amongst its peers. And in line with that philosophy, Athene began publishing historical credit losses in their fixed income investor presentation last quarter, which will be updated in conjunction with our next call next week on November 9.  As it relates to capital allocation, the construct we laid out two years ago at our Investor Day remains largely intact, with delays in exiting private equity investments impacting the timing, but not the expected quantum of carry to be generated. Meanwhile, Athene has been maintaining its consistent dividend up to the holding company in a significantly more attractive growth backdrop amid rising rates.  To support this we have increased participation from ADIP and issued the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August, the proceeds of which were downstream to Athene. At the same time, the sheer number of organic growth opportunities at the asset manager and a targeted 20% return on group capital by growing Athene has resulted in little need to invest in the business through M&A.  Balancing all these dynamics, we expect to continue immunizing all regularly equity-based compensation when it's issued. And we expect to immunize both the dilutive impacts of the mandatory convertible preferred and the vested stock awards we announced today over the next few years as capital is available, targeting a share count of 600 million shares outstanding. We anticipate additional capacity within our current five-year plan, but back ended to consider opportunistic for share repurchase in addition to.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Sure. So, on the AAA side, we've been actually very pleased at how sales are progressing there. So we had our best quarter yet, a little over $700 million in the last quarter for AAA. So week-by-week, month-by-month, we are getting AAA on to more selling platforms, more sales agreements. So progress is good there on the retail side. We expect this to continue grow up, as you know. The retail business is all about getting on to more platforms, more bankers, more selling agreements not only AAA but all our products, ADS, ARIS. This is how we are progressing. This is why in my prepared comments, I just talked about we're finishing up year two of our global wealth focus and we just see so much more positive momentum as we get these selling agreements signed up in place, product-by-product, area-by-area, region-by-region, just a huge opportunity. So really positive momentum across all the products we have in market right now. Like I said earlier, we have seven product families out there right now. We have a few more coming in 2024 where at that point we feel like we'll have a fairly complete line up across the asset classes. And so yes, good progress. Great, Brian. So what I said is that's sort of current best estimate, obviously. And so we're focused on all the fundraising initiatives Scott raised. Putting money to work in an environment which we think is conducive to our investing orientation, and then continuing to build out the capital solutions business. And so any -- we've made assumptions around each of the three of them, any of them could be a plus or minus to the guidance I gave. And so we'll talk more about capital solutions on the 14th. That's one of the objectives of the day to connect that back to the origination strategy, and our fixed income, origination and distribution focus. But yes, in the comments I made, we are assuming it's flat. Is there upside? Potentially, but we're really, really happy with the growth of the business. A five-year plan in two years is pretty heroic. And so we're focused on building out that business further and repeating the success we've had. So with a primary emphasis on credit and then building it out to other -- to co-invest over time. Yes, we had -- you need to look at the normalized net spread. That's why we try to focus on the net of the two. There was a benefit in cost of funds for the quarter that we telegraphed last quarter related to the Venerable reinsurance transaction. And so that impacted cost of funds, which we then normalized out in the net spread. So I would look at the 165 basis points as the guide is our current best view and it takes account of things like that, the Arco buy down during the quarter, which are sort of episodic but not recurring."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thanks, Noah, and good morning to all. Another great quarter amidst interesting financial markets and certainly a challenging year for many in our industry. Just to highlight performance; quarterly FRE up 29% year-over-year, quarterly SRE 36% year-over-year, margin expansion three quarters in a row now, inflows for the third quarter 33 billion, 125 billion year-to-date, deployment 36 billion, fundamentally momentum both sides of the business.  Our business model is very robust, as I will track for you. We expect another 30 billion plus/minus of inflows for Q4, bringing total inflows for the year to 150 billion. The momentum we see in the business tells me we will have an on track continued good performance heading into Q4. Obviously, a quarter is not done yet but everything we see tells us the momentum will continue.  In global wealth, which I'll just do a quick shout out to given how hard the team has been working, there are now seven perpetual wealth products in the market today. Scott will go through this in detail. And just to close out, origination volume tracking north of the 100 billion on an annualized level. Fundamentally, everything in the business is working and I believe we're set up appropriately to benefit from the current market. Almost everything in our business works better with higher rates.  Credit, as you know, is a much bigger part of our business mix than most of our peer group, something we've built over a long period of time. And as to remind you, we are focused on senior secured top of the capital structure. This is a big difference between what people normally think of as private credit and otherwise. But we want a business that last, one that has duration, one that is set up for a difficult economy, notwithstanding all the positives happening in the credit market.  To give you a sense, impairments at Athene at or below last year's level we expect for the year and the year-to-date, notwithstanding some back and forth quarter-to-quarter. Fundamentally, the book is in very good shape. On the equity side of our business, purchase price matters, which is our strategy, has really paid off. There's lots of dry powder in the equity business in private markets. But many people are sitting on the sidelines.  They have no idea how much of their existing capital is going to need to be used to solve problems in their existing portfolio to get refinancings done. Purchase price matter and being disciplined over the past decade has left us with a very small number of situations that will require fixing, and therefore we have been on offense, tremendous deployment, which Scott will detail in our private equity business and in our hybrid business.  If you like something now in the equity business, given all the geopolitical implications, given the concerns over recession, given the high-rate environment, given what is generally very difficult financing conditions, you really like it. On the margin deployment into the equity business, I think for all of '23 will prove for our industry to be very, very attractive. So what's really happening? Let me step back and give you my view at least on what I think is happening in markets and in private markets. And then I'll start -- I look at my career, which is now 39 years and I think we have benefited from four tailwinds over this period of time. We've had rates generally going from high to low. We have printed a massive amount of money. We have borrowed forward future demand through fiscal stimulus and fiscal borrowing. And we've had the benefit of globalization.  It does not surprise me with those four tailwinds that risk assets, equities, growth, real estate, things like that did really well. But I ask myself, are any of those four things true today? I think there's an argument as to whether there are headwinds or just the absence of tailwinds. But everything that I see tells me that looking backward is not likely to be a good indication of what needs to be done going forward for investment success, in particular, looking backward over the past 10 years, which I view as an absolute aberration, will not be a good guide going forward. And the strategies that performed over the past period of time with these tailwinds are not going to perform in the new environment that we have.  I also think there have been fundamental changes that have happened to markets and market structure over the past years as well, the most significant of which happened in 2008. 2008, we came very close to an absolute debacle in our financial system. The rules of how our financial markets work were fundamentally rewritten. We, not just Apollo but all of us, we just didn't notice. Because right after we changed the rules, we printed $8 trillion and everything went up into the right. Well, now that we are no longer doing that, now that rates are up, now that there are headwinds, we are starting to notice some of these changes, and I'll stick to three and I'll talk about their implications.  One is liquidity, public market liquidity. By some estimates, dealer capital, capital that facilitates trading, is roughly 10% today of what it was in 2008. Markets are 3x their size. That tells me we have just less liquidity in public markets. We have already seen the first complete breakdown of functioning in market, which was UK LDI last year. It will not surprise me going forward to see liquidity challenged, public markets challenged, and investors beginning to understand that liquidity only exists on the way up and does not exist on the way down, we should expect a more volatile, less liquid world in public markets.  The second is the role of banks, not just in our economy but in economies around the world. Dodd-Frank in theory was targeted at constraining the power of the four big banks in the U.S. following the financial crisis. But the banking system in general, guess what it worked? Banks today in the U.S. markets are roughly 20% of debt capital to consumers and businesses. All of you, investors, now supply 80% of debt capital to businesses.  In addition, the changes that are now proposed to occur following the debacle at SVB and First Republic and Credit Suisse will further lead to debanking. When regulators asked banks in the U.S. to put up 15% more capital, they're asking the banks to shrink or to shrink lines of business. When Europe moves from Basel III to Basel IV, they're asking banks to shrink. This is happening around the world. Debanking is not something that is periodic. It is at its very early infancy.  It does not mean that banking is a bad business. It does not mean the four big banks don't have amazing businesses. They do. But it means on the margin, they will continue to play less and less as a percentage of the total and new investors will play more and more. That tells me as investors that you will see over the next decade, a series of financial products that you've never seen before, because they have historically been resident-only on the balance sheets of large banks and they are on their way to you as investment product.  On the third, and what I focus on is this notion of indexation and correlation. 80% of volume today of trading is S&P 500, 60% of our markets are ETFs, 10 stocks make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500. These 10 stocks are responsible for 100% of year-to-date returns. These 10 stocks have traded between 52 and 44 PE over the last few weeks. Not many of you come in every day looking to buy 50 PE stocks, yet we feel really comfortable with a massive portion of our country's retirement system assets and fiduciary assets in 50 PE stocks. We have literally never had so much concentration in so few instruments since the NIFTY 50. Going back, it predates my career. But if one looks at the data from that period of time, a decade later, investors lost nearly 90% of their money. I'm not saying that's what's happening here. What I'm pointing out is we had this perception historically that public was safe and private was risky. I ask, is that even the right framework to think about how market\u2019s structured today? Is public safe and is private risky or are both public and private both risky and safe? I do think that that is the conclusion, and that's where investors will move to.  Let me dig in a little bit on private credit. Private credit is the flavor of the day in our industry. You can look at press mentions, you can look at all the articles, you can look at what our colleagues and peers have had to say on their various calls. Private credit for us has been the mainstay of our business. We are nearly 500 billion in private credit, away from the 2,600 people who work in Apollo Asset Management and the more than 2,000 people who work at Athene. There are 4,000 people at Apollo who do not carry an Apollo business card, who work at one of our 16 platforms that Noah referenced where we will do a deep dive, and their job every single day is to create credit, create private credit, which I'll come to. And that's what they come in and do every day. We've assembled this over the last decade plus for between $6 billion and $8 billion. Truthfully, our ecosystem is second to none in this business.  As I mentioned, I believe we are in the first inning or the infancy of private credit. Private credit is a secular trend and it follows the debanking that I mentioned, and it is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it is a worldwide phenomenon. We have to-date as a financial press and as an industry talked about private credit as if it meant to be levered lending, sometimes called direct lending, was private credit. Let me tell you, this is a fraction of a fraction of what debanking will produce.  This piece of the business of lending to buyout sponsors sometimes is a very good business. It is about to get commoditized. Lots of capital is coming to this area. There are low barriers to entry. And investors understand this. They are moving toward firms that have established ecosystems, that have long track records of risk and reward, that will not chase the hot dot in this market because yes, there will be a hot dot in this market as well.  When I talk about private credit, I'm really talking about the secular change as a result of debanking. I start with the notion that everything on a bank balance sheet is actually private credit. What we've seen so far and what the press has focused on is levered lending, which, as I said, is a fraction of a fraction. I think we're going to be talking about this for the next 10 years. And the vast, vast majority of what we're interested in private credit is actually investment grade. The difference between where we are today and where I think we will be is all about education and nomenclature. Investors are being asked really challenging questions today. Is a single A rated private security an alternative or fixed income? Sometimes I can stop a CIO at a big fund for an hour with that question. If it's an alternative because it is private and that's how they think about the world, they're not going to buy it because they need 15% and 20% rates of return out of their alternative bucket.  But if it is fixed income, because it is rated the same as fixed income and it offers 200 to 300 basis points of excess return for the same risk, institutional investors, family offices, wealthy individuals should be able to tolerate some degree of illiquidity if they're getting paid for it, particularly if I go back to my secular themes of liquidity is not so good in the public market. Most of what's out there has been commoditized. I do think this is our future. I do think we as a group will be talking about private credit, and I expect the conversation to become much, much more sophisticated.  Away from the business, I sometimes joke that we raise money, we invest money, and we compensate people. The raising of money, the investing of money seems to be in very good shape. I'm fortunate that Scott and Jim live and breathe this every single day. I, therefore, get to focus on compensating people. And it's not just compensating people. It's also about the culture. As I've said previously, our North Star is to build the best partnership in financial services.  If we can be the best place for our 200 partners to work, we will retain their judgment throughout their whole career. We will also send a message to our next generation of principals that partnership at Apollo is what it's all about. And then throughout the organization, younger people entering our firm no matter how hard they are working, and they are working hard and I thank you, you will have two amazing generations of mentors to teach you the business. This is the ecosystem that we're trying to create.  We also are trying to do something for shareholders. We understand that shareholders value more highly those things that are highly predictable, FRE and SRE, and value less highly those things that are volatile, PII. Just look at this year where FRE and SRE are up nearly 30% each and PII reflecting market conditions is down very significantly from what we would expect as a long run average. Our goal over time is to pay our people more PII and less FRE and SRE. And that is the trend we are on.  At our Investor Day some two years ago, we laid out a trajectory of how we're doing. Today, Martin will update you and tell you we are not only on that trajectory, we are now pivoting to actually exceed that trajectory. What Martin will detail for you is not just a financial transaction, but also focused on the next generation of leadership. We have, and as Martin will detail, decided to fundamentally change the compensation for four of our next generation of leaders. These are not the only leaders who in my view are capable of the next generation, but there are four who are very visible within our organization; Matt Nord, David Sambur, John Zito and Grant Kvalheim. All four of them have taken on increasing amounts of responsibility over the years. They now see not just to oversee their individual departments. They oversee massive pieces of our firm that are integrated. And as such, we've decided to compensate them substantially in stock. That does not necessarily mean more, it just means different.  What we've decided to do is to take the compensation of FRE and SRE and PII that they would have received and replace a very large portion of that with stock, so they are aligned with Jim and Scott and myself, but also with all of you. This will create room for us to further give that PII that those four individuals hold to others in our firm in our constant battle and our constant direction to keep more of the FRE and SRE for the house and less of the PII. And that I believe is how it should be.  Employees, particularly our partners, are well suited to understand PII and to bear the volatility of good and bad of PII. I believe this to be a good outcome for shareholders. I view it as a good outcome for me personally. And I know Jim and Scott view it as a good outcome for them, having everyone aligned and being paid in the same way, extraordinarily important. I will also tell you, we are committed to immunizing the stocks that we intend to grant and Martin will detail that for you as well.  So Noah is already tapping his watch and telling me that my time is almost up. Fundamentally, we are on track to hit our five-year plan. Athene, as you know, has already exceeded its five-year plan. Of the three big bets that we laid out, capital solutions in two years has already hit its five-year plan. Origination and global wealth are well on track to meet their five-year plan. So fundamentally, we're confident to meet or exceed the goals that we laid out in our first five-year plan. And it feels almost like it's time for the next update.  There are so many interesting things happening in asset management, so many interesting fundamental changes in market, and so we are committed to hosting our next Investor Day later in '24, which Noah will detail to really talk about where we go from here. With that, I'll remind you, the goal that we're after, deliver the targets that we've told you plus a little while maintaining our culture. We are not seeking to be the biggest. We're not seeking to be the fastest growing. We're seeking to build something that is sustainable over a very long period of time.  With that, I'm going to turn it over to Scott. Okay. Thanks, Patrick. It's Marc. So what came out yesterday is not much different than what the industry saw seven years ago. Seven years ago, we and the rest of the industry prepared and actually made changes, extensive changes to how products and fees and features were disclosed. And so truthfully, not much new. In terms of your question on exposure of the business, about 10% of our business is through wholesalers. Another 10% is also to accounts but it's through banks that would have a very easy time adjusting to this because they essentially already charged that way anyway. So specifically, roughly 10% of the business is focused and not really worked up about it. This is where we were prepared to be seven years ago. And I think we're still a ways away from a final rule here anyway. Glenn, it's Marc. So we've been watching this for the last 14 years. Fundamentally, there is no difference in the quality of any of these four channels. We run a business around cost of funds. Sometimes various channels are attractive, sometimes other channels are attractive. What we're seeing is there's a fundamental demand, not just in the U.S., but everywhere in the world, for guaranteed income. People need retirement solutions. If you look at the vast pools of capital in the U.S., for instance, in 401(k), where there's $8 trillion to $10 trillion, we force people who need returns the most to be daily liquid for 50 years. What we're doing as a country makes little sense. And consumers know that. And so what they've done as soon as they have access to their funds, increasingly, they are in higher rate environments, seeking out guaranteed lifetime income. The demand we're seeing on annuities, either directly or through reinsurance is fundamental. Reinsurance, again, no different to us than direct business other than it tends to be in markets or in market segments we don't serve or don't serve yet. So I don't feel there is any difference one way or the other in the way these things go. As it relates to the broader question, we have a choice. We have a choice of the capital intensity of our business. If we want to be more capital intensive, we put up $0.08 to $0.10 of every dollar. And we retain 100% of the business. If we do that, SRE grows faster because we're retaining more business. And it grows faster because we tend to earn 15% year-in and year-out on the capital that we put up. Really good option. We have, as you know, made a business decision that on the margin, we tend to fund around a third, between 30% and 40%, depending on the mix of business and the regulatory source of the business of every new deal which means that we put up 30% to 40% of that 8% to 10% and that will alter the SRE growth rate. I think what we've said to you over the long term is that we expect the retirement services business to be a low mid double digit rate of return grower. At every quarter, Jim Belardi, Grant Kvalheim and team are embarrassing us. And this year, as you know, it's up 30%. What we're seeing this year is what Martin detailed. Not only are we seeing fundamental demand for guaranteed income, which is driven by secular trends like you and I getting older but we're also seeing widening spread. We are reluctant to budget increased spread of 160, 175 basis points, which is 30 to 50 basis points above what Athene has done historically. But if we continue to see the scale of debanking in the investment grade segments of the market, I think we will continue to put up spread, but that's -- the kinds of spreads we are, but that's not how we budget and that's not how we telegraph where we think we're going. We think the prudent thing is to budget the way we have historically and let the performance speak for itself. So we are plus minus 30 billion of net floating rate assets. If you look at the growth of the business over the next two or three years and you consider the mix of our liabilities, we will want to be two, three years from now 30 billion of net floating rate assets. Having said that, we probably are relative to our liability position 10 billion to 15 billion excess floating rate assets over what we would want to or consider a long-term prudent position. You should expect that we will take action over the near term to reduce the short-term mismatch reflecting that, and that's factored into everything that we've discussed with you today. So I'm just going to leave you with this following sense, Alex. What we're trying to do here is similar to what we're doing in the rest of the business. As you know, I've said publicly, certainly for high net worth families, family offices, I think they will be 50% plus alternatives over the next five years. And we're seeing that kind of uptake and traction. The difference between where we are and where I think we're going to be is only education. When we say we're on a platform, one of the big private banks, it may be 5% or 10% of the financial advisors. This is an education, an evangelical activity with more and more converts every day. And so if you take AAA, and I know you premised your question as a complex product, I'll make it an easier product. You can buy the S&P 500 at a 50 PE or you could buy roughly the same historical return at a much higher sharp ratio and give up liquidity. That is the choice we're actually seeing investors make. And while private markets are something that many on this call and we are very familiar with, the vast majority of investors thinking back over the 40 years, they've been doing just fine, owning the S&P and the 30-year treasury. And my point of starting where I started is I don't think with the absence of tailwinds, people are going to get the same performance. I don't think what I'm saying is all that controversial. We're now just in a period of education where people consider what does the market look like? How do I invest without tailwinds? What does it mean that public markets are less liquid on the way down? What does it mean to have debanking? What does it mean to have indexation and concentration? I believe when you look forward at asset management more generally over the next five years, I think you're going to see an asset management industry that is continuing to grow in its passive strategies. I think you will see boutiques who offer access to uncorrelated returns, or at least non-market correlated returns, such as ourselves and others grow. I think the tougher part of our industry, which you're already seeing is active management, harder and harder for active managers to produce good returns, certainly in fixed income. I question whether there's any alpha left in publicly traded fixed income markets. And given indexation and concentration, I think it's very, very difficult in equity markets. So I like where we sit. I like our hands of cards. It does not mean, again, we're going to be the biggest or the fastest growing. In the retail market, we want to be thought of as prudent and creative, growing our footprint every quarter, but not spiking it, taking too much money at a point in time to chase a hot strategy just makes no sense. It ultimately produces concentration risk, which some of our peers have seen by taking too much money at a point in time. Slow and steady, constant build is what we're seeking to do. Okay. So, look, it starts with investor demand for guaranteed lifetime income or guaranteed income is going up. And I think investors will ultimately seek out places to do that. Historically, products like annuities have been very complicated because they offer a variety of options and other things and therefore they have had more of a complex sell. Therefore, you have [ph] needed advice and that advice has therefore a more expensive distribution than something you can buy off the shelf. I remain skeptical on direct distribution. But I also see the proliferation of distribution. Increasingly, financial products like guaranteed income are being sold through the banking system, are being sold through RIAs. And if you focus in on the specific issue, these are not issues of the closure. They're actually not issues of product features. We and many in our industry have already made the changes going back seven years, because that was just best practice. I think there will be more pressure on fee. That clearly is what it's at. And we can have both sides of that. I'm not going to say it's good or bad. But I've watched in other places around the world where the focus has been on fee. Take Australia, you have the biggest or the best retirement system anywhere in the world, 3.5 trillion for 28 million of population. Well, they have a big problem there. They actually legislated out all the fees. So now there's no advice. No one provides advice. And so at 65, when people get their big lump sum distribution from the superannuation product, they don't know what to do with it, and people are dying between 35% and 40% of their retirement income intact. The government doesn't like that, because there's been no advice on what I'll call decumulation. How do you set yourself up to live through however long you're going to live given increasing life spans? Eventually, I believe we're going to come to a sensible place that may be lower fee and distribution. Truthfully, it doesn't bother me in the slightest bit, a small piece of the business. I don't think this is going to result in fundamental changes in distribution. I think it may change how product is priced, and that's okay. But I'm going to use this to make a point, which I've made previously. When you originate new product, you originate product that is protected by surrender charge, market value adjustment, or in the case of PRT is fully locked in. You should, therefore, be willing to have a higher cost of funds for fully protected product because you can invest against it. It gives you longevity. It gives you certainty. We have four different channels and we look at each of the four channels on a regular basis and we try to keep our cost of funds low because we know if we have a low cost of funds, if we're not good investors, we can earn spread. And if we're good investors, we can earn a lot of spread. What's happened in our market is you now have a number of entities who have seen what we have built and are late to the game. The way they intend to get into this business or trying to get into the business is to buy back books of business. Buying a back book of business with degraded surrender charge, integrated market value adjustments in a low rate environment may be sensible, because in a low rate environment, the contract rate is above the rate in the market, therefore you expect the book to behave predictably. But in the market we're in right now, for someone to buy a secondary book of business and pay for a cost of funds in excess of that of retail kind of tells you all you need to know about the quality of the business that people are buying. And I encourage you to push as hard on cost of funds across the board. It ultimately simplifies what is a very complex business. We're in the spread business. Having low cost of funds is really important. Sure. As you know, the old portfolio is made up of 150 different positions, about half of which relates to our origination platforms, about a third -- the remaining quarter is about funds and other I would say hybrid type products. And then the last quarter would be other bespoke and direct investments. Overall, we still look at that portfolio as being, call it, 12% plus the last couple quarters. Given the environment, there's been a little bit of slower appreciation, as you've just seen in the broader market, but really no fundamental concerns there about what's in that. As we've always said, that portfolio will sort of deliver you 8 in a really bad year, 18 in a really good year and 12 to 15 expected. And we see nothing deviating from that."

This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures during this conference, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I will now turn the conference over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Great Thanks Donna and welcome again everyone to our call. We're really thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with you this morning. Earlier, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the investor relations portion of our website. Within these documents you'll see that we generated very solid results that included record quarterly fee related earnings of $442 million or $0.74 per share, and record quarterly normalized spread related earnings of $874 million, or $1.47 per share. Together, these two earnings streams totaled $1.3 billion in the second quarter, increasing more than 40% year-over-year, demonstrating the strong, resilient and fully aligned growth characteristics of our asset management and retirement services businesses. Combined with principal investing income and other HoldCo items, we reported normalized adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.80 per share, up 60% year-over-year. Joining me from our team to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO, Jim Zelter Co President, and Martin Kelly, CFO. And we've received some feedback from some of you that we should attempt to shorten the length of our prepared remarks. So at the risk of making a false promise, Marc himself has ensured us that we'll be endeavoring to do that today. So with that, I'll turn it over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan : Thanks Noah, and we all can wish for certain things and hope that they come through. In any event, as no Noah said it was truly a very, very strong quarter, normalized SRE and FRE of $1.3 billion for the quarter. And we are on track to earn FRE and normalize SRE of ,$5 billion plus minus for the year which Martin will detail. One thing worth calling out is just how exceptionally strong SRE has been. Just to put in context, Athene has now grown or will grow 30% SRE two years in a row, and they actually have hit their 2026 financial target as laid out in our Investor Day some two years ago, in just two years. Not only are they doing an exceptional job, but clearly Jim and Grant and the team have exceptionally sandbagged everyone, and the business continues to be very strong. In addition to financial results, we had record inflows for the quarter on an organic basis, we had some $43 billion of inflows including $8 billion that closed shortly after the quarter end. This closing shortly after quarter end is actually a feature of the alternatives business. Many of our institutional investors prefer to close on the first of the month, and have something in another out -- another quarter from an allocation point of view rather than in the prior month. And for many of our retail High Net Worth Focused Funds, they also close on the first of the month. So I expect that we will be a little more careful and giving guidance quarter by quarter to account for how this business actually operates. From my point of view, and as Martin and we have discussed previously, we generated positive operating leverage and margin expansion this quarter. And we expect this to continue over the next couple of years as we benefit from the investments that we've made in people and facilities and upgrading our business over the past few years. In short, our strategic positioning is excellent. And anchored by three really simple principles. One purchase price matter. The second excess return per unit of risk. That is what we do, and full alignment with our clients, both our institutional and our retail clients. It actually feels pretty good. Having not chased the hot dot during an era of money printing and zero rates. Our opportunity set is just different than that of our peer group. Apollo has momentum. In terms of the business, let me start for the quarter and with the equity business, in the equity business this year has really marked the end of an era. So if I think about what happened over the prior decade, and perhaps longer than a decade, there were these incredible tailwinds in the equity business, tailwinds from money printing, pulling forward of demand, fiscal stimulus, and certainly from zero rates. We now find ourselves in an absence of tailwinds rates are higher, growth is slower. Globalization is in retreat. People will have to go back to investing the old fashioned way. They'll actually have to be very good investors; they will need to produce alpha. I believe that's what we've been doing. Demonstrated by the recent private equity results. The final close for Fund X in mid-July, brought in capital, just around $20 billion over a 12-month marketing period versus continuing to market over an extended timeline. The fund is now closed. Fund IX generated 36% gross IRR, 24% net IRR. In the quarter, just a really interesting time in the private equity business between haves and have nots. Our Arconic and Univar are two very large financings, which certainly came at it time that was challenging for the market both executed better than expected giving us increased confidence in the ability to get transactions we like done. Let me move on from the equity business and talk about the two drivers of the quarter and what I expect to drive the rest of the year. First private credit. As I've said previously, private credit, these are two words that actually mean nothing. Private credit can be investment grade, private credit can be Triple C. Barriers to entry in the private credit business are either quite low, anyone with a fund, and a staff capable of evaluating investments can truly enter the private credit business, or barriers to entry can be extraordinarily high. And building a full ecosystem that allows you to serve the needs of your clients in a very sophisticated way. Think of the difference between a hotdog stand and a Michelin star restaurant, both are in the food business, and both serve food. That is how we think about private credit. And where people are positioned. Financial markets, financial literacy around private credit has actually gotten quite sloppy. What is private credit? Well, if we start in the abstract, everything that is on a bank balance sheet is private credit. But most of the time, market pundits talk about private credit. They're talking about a very small sliver of a private credit universe that's focused on levered lending. Don't get me wrong, we liked the levered lending business. Levered lending is actually a terrific business right now. It will not always be a terrific business. It is a cyclical business with low barriers to entry. But one that at the right point in time, can be very lucrative. What we have tried to build is not a single fund, is not a single opportunity. We've tried to build an ecosystem. By reflect on the past decade, we've invested some $8 billion building 16 origination platforms. There are 4,000 people who work in these platforms, not Apollo employees, who are solely focused every single day on originating private credit. And as you know, much, much if not most of what they do is investment grade. That's important because the investment grade market is at least 8 times larger than the high yield market and 8 times larger than the levered lending market. This is a great time for private credit. This is not a quarter, that's a great time for private credit. This is secular change. Not only do we have higher base rates and regulatory change and change in market dynamics, we are in the beginning of a secular shift in how credit is provided to businesses and a shift that I believe will continue to gather speed. To be successful in this market, you need a recurring supply of unique origination. This quarter we originated some $23 billion with 50% of that from platforms. Jim Zelter will detail some of these transactions. But in addition to the names you would expect that are traditionally associated with private credit, AT&T, Air France and the Novia. Borrowers value, certainty, scale, and speed to execution. In addition to origination, you need an integrated capital markets business. Because after all, we want 25% of everything, and 100% of nothing. Our ACS business led by Craig Farr has done an extraordinary job extending our reach of private credit to clients and to non-clients. In fact, this is among the greatest ways that we introduce the firm to people who are not yet clients of Apollo and show them what we're capable of. This quarter, we raised some $7 billion of capital from third party insurers. And we expect this to gather speed as the market continues to improve. For private credit, particularly investment grade, the way that consumers and businesses borrow is traditionally through the asset backed market. Asset backed is for the most part, private credit. This is a $20 trillion market, and one in which we have been playing for a very, very long time. More than $220 billion of volume to date, better than 200 relationships. We have currently more than $100 billion of AUM associated with ABF, $55 billion of which is third party. Most of what happens for us in ABF is investment grade and it is a key driver of our insurance business for Athene and for our third party insurance clients and increasingly for fixed income replacement for our traditional institutional clients. One of the single most important factors in this market is that we are completely aligned with our client base. We own what they own at the same time at the same price. There is nothing that is more confidence inspiring than alignment. Let me move on from private credit to talk a little bit about the job Athene did in the quarter. Athene\u2019s results are in part driven by the ability of Apollo to source attractive investment grade credit, but also by the incredibly talented team that has been building Athene for the past 14 years. Normalized SRE for the quarter was $874 million, and normalized net spread was 166 basis points truly the widest I can remember. $19 billion of organic inflows in the quarter, up more than 50% year-over-year, number one annuity market share. We now have line of sight to more than $60 billion of organic inflows this year. We are leaving by some estimates between $10 billion and $20 billion of annual originations on the table. Truly, we have an opportunity now to be selective, and to build recurring franchises. We made progress this quarter in Japan, through our reinsurance business, and elsewhere in Asia. And I believe the business at Athene is gathering speed. Although, as I've cautioned in prior quarters, as I'm sure Martin will detail, these are truly exceptionally good times. And we are beneficiaries of the large floating rate position that we have carried for more than a decade. Also recall that our business is built at the top of the capital structure on a senior secured basis, and we sleep better at night. Credit experience in the quarter was incredibly benign, less than two basis points, which I'm sure Martin will detail. Surrenders or outflows also came in better than forecast. And if you recall from the chart we've included in this quarter as well as prior quarters as well as the education we've been doing. The primary driver of surrenders is not what happens at any point in time and interest rates. It is the timing of the expiration of programs that we put on three and five years ago, and for the most part is highly predictable. It is difficult to imagine going from startup or new business to where Athene is today. Right now we have not done an inorganic transaction for a number of years. But we are the beneficiary of four very diverse channels, retail, PRT, reinsurance, and funding agreements. All four of those channels are dependent on a stable and high quality credit rating. And having an infrastructure and a scale and an operating expense ratio that allow you to leverage the business. We could not have built the business we have today in organically in a high rate environment. We were fortunate in a low rate environment to have been able to purchase inorganic blocks. At a time when their contract rates were above market rates therefore our risk of surrender was very low. In contrast, in today's market, someone buying an inorganic block is actually buying a block where surrender charges and market value adjustments have degraded and is at much greater risk of a melting ice cube. In short, it is not a stable base on which to build the business and will make it very difficult for people to achieve the kind of scale we have achieved. Recall that we bought in Athene for some $11 billion at acquisition and Athena will earn $3.1 billion plus minus of normalized SRE for the fiscal year. In short, the team is doing an incredible job and distribution and maturation and product has not yet even matured. There is more to come. An effort to keep on time. Let me focus on one last topic, which I know it's been of interest to people, really want to talk about the market environment, particularly the regulatory environment, and the environment as it relates to our banking peers. In short, we have never had such a collaborative dialogue with the banking system. We have gone from not only being a great customer and partner of the banking system to a true collaborator. The shape of our business, particularly our willingness to do very large investment grade transactions, has made us an indispensable partner. And I do mean partner with the banking system. While some talk about the dancing of this being a great time for private credit, I've noticed that there's actually been dancing on both sides both on the bank and the private credit side as most banks put in an extraordinarily good quarter, and are on their way to an extraordinarily good year. We are also very symbiotic. Recall that we want the asset, but do not want what the bank typically wants, which is the customer. The bank wants the customer and typically does not want most of or any of the asset. If I step back, the US financial system is the envy of the world. We raise 50% of the world's capital. And part of the reason we are the envy of the world is the structure of our system. Banks have their role, and the investment marketplace has its role. Our system has all types of participants. But the vast, vast majority of those participants borrow short and invest long or have short term money. Think of an open ended mutual fund, which has daily liquidity, many hedge funds, quarterly liquidity, banks, daily liquidity at least on deposits, the ability to bring institutional investors retirement systems and insurance companies who have long dated liabilities or long dated assets to this market, make them ideal partners for the short dated capital of the banking system and the open ended mutual funds. In short, long term locked in liabilities are a source of stability and somewhat counter cyclical for our financial system. It does not matter whether they are in funds, which are themselves very stable, or they are on retirement services balance sheet. Totality of the market from the investor side does no maturity transformation, has no access to the Fed window, does not benefit from US government guarantee. And in our case, if you look at the Retirement Services balance sheet, we hold more Tier 1 capital and more Tier 2 capital than the vast majority of the top 10 banks in the US. We do cash flow testing and scenario testing and provide a granularity to our portfolio that very few institutions, if any can match. Our balance sheet is much more investment grade than the typical depository institution. In short, our model is highly complementary the banking system, we have never been more collaborative. And I expect this collaboration to increase as regulatory change gathers pace both in the US, Europe, and even the beginnings of regulatory change in Asia. As we're nearing the end of summer, the team is in great shape, and focused on executing the plan. We are sticking with no new toys, the upside from simply executing what's in front of us is incredibly strong. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJim Zelter: Thanks, Marc. Marc did a great job outlining our competitive positioning and our vision. And now we'll spend a few minutes translating how some of these important themes are playing throughout our firm with investment environment, our investment performance and fundraising. It's clear to us and like many of you as well, the demand for private credit solutions has risen significantly, as higher cost of capital has reduced the availability of traditional financing sources. We believe we're uniquely positioned to address this need for a few reasons, the scale of our capital resources, the speed of execution and the sophistication and creativity of our investment underwriting. We are continuing to diligently build the largest alternative credit business in the industry. And our success today is attributable to the expansive capabilities, or what we call the Apollo toolbox. From corporate sponsors and everything else in between. We can flexibly serve clients that need capital in a collaborative and bespoke manner. Across Apollo, we are helping healthy and growing companies who are hamstrung by a limited open public market. The second quarter was a prime example of this, a period that started with the fallout from the regional bank crisis and ended with the markets feeling a bit more accommodating. As you might expect, we were particularly active and then deployed nearly $35 billion of capital across our platform during the quarter. Much of this activity was driven by the yield business across our various sourcing channels, including financing solutions to corporates, which we call high grade Alpha. Our origination platforms, as well as more traditional origination through strategies such as large cap direct lending, or leveraged lending, CRE debt and a variety of structured credit CLO origination. In an extremely active quarter, one of the signature financing solutions we provided was for company Wolfspeed, a silicon carbide materials and device manufacturer. We led an investment group that provided a $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion secured note to the company as they undertook a significant growth initiative to meet accelerating demand. In this case, we work with Wolfspeed to structure a non-dilutive and flexible credit solution, which resulted in a unique win-win for the company's debt and equity investors. And another example of capabilities that happened more recently, we partnered with our client and our partner, Air France-KLM, one of the world's leading airlines, following the execution of two successful innovative equity capital transactions with Air France, we announced last week that we've entered into an exclusive discussion to provide a EUR 1.5 billion capital solution through funds we manage and insurance affiliates to Air France-KLM\u2019s Flying Blue Loyalty program. Flying Blue is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs, and this transaction would further bolster the company's already strong capital position. We are proud to say that this would be the third of a unique series of capital solutions to aid Air-France KLM, increasing our total capital support to the company to more than EUR 2.5 billion over the last 12 months. Amid our expanding opportunity set to originate investment grade assets, debt origination activity across our 16 platforms remains strong. Notably, the acquisition of Atlas SP Partners, the former CS business, the newest and largest asset backed financing platform in our portfolio is now fully closed with both client and employee retention rates exceeding our expectations. Atlas has been extremely active in the market executing over 30 securitizations since March, and has substantial near term pipeline. Some of the larger, other larger platforms, namely MidCap and Wheels are writing business at attractive spreads, and generating ROEs in the mid to high teens range. While we've been actively deploying capital, we continue to prioritize generating excess return per unit of risk. Investment performance remains strong and consistent in the quarter. Marc touched on the equity business and I'd like to add our direct origination, corporate credit and structured credit strategies, portfolios appreciated 4%, 3% and 2% respectively in the second quarter with each category outperforming indexes we benchmark in the same period. Performance across hybrid strategies also have been solid with hybrid value and our more opportunistic credit strategies, each returning in excess of 4% for the quarter. Through a period of weaker public market performance last year, and some instability in the first half of the year driving strong investment performance over the past year has not been easy. Through that lens, it's worth highlighting a few strategies in particular, ADS, our non-traded BDC we manage, Redding Ridge, our CLO originator or Core Plus, our multi asset opportunistic credit offering and Structured Credit Recovery Fund IV have all outperformed relevant indexes over the last 12 months. Turning our focus to fundraising, we generated a record organic inflow of $35 billion, driven by strong momentum at Athene as well as a third party asset management business. Across third party, we raised $15 billion in this specific quarter, with an additional $8 billion slipping into the first few weeks of this current quarter. The investments we made over the last 24 months to expand into adjacencies and whitespace opportunities, such as secondaries and clean transition, and ones where we believe we have a strategic edge, such as third party insurance and global wealth have begun to pay off. Some of the areas where we've seen recent momentum include third party insurance, where we've developed a comprehensive client coverage network to ensure coordination across all parts of the firm, and establish a curated solution set for this fast growing client type. We think our expertise in managing retirement service balance sheets, on both the asset and liability side is a meaningful differentiator in this market. And we're continuing to be very bullish on the long-term global growth opportunities in this business. Next is our sidecar initiative, where we raised over $4 billion across four sidecars so far this year, and sidecars enable institutional investors to invest alongside various investment strategies, mostly credit related with greater scale and flexibility than they would otherwise achieve in a coming of fund. This type of structure is growing trend and a great way to partner with more sophisticated investors. We have a strong pipeline in the sidecar opportunities across the global institutional investor base for the remainder of \u201823 supported with a dialogue of over 60 investors. And finally, capital raised from individual investors to continues to be a strategic priority. Through the substantial investment we've made in the new product creation and distribution expansion. We built a diverse global wealth platform by asset class, product structure, distribution channel, and geographic reach, all of which has helped migrate recent market driven headwinds. We're focused on continuing to broaden our retail focused product suite and continue to expect launching one to two products each quarter into 2024. In terms of distribution expansion, we've made some notable progress for Apollo aligned alternatives AAA specifically, which is now offered on five bank platforms, and has additional global US and non-US banks, as well as RIAs and other wealth channels in the second half of the year. We've also seen a monthly inflow into Apollo Debt Solutions. I mentioned our non-traded credit PDC we manage, ramp following the strong investment performance, and this occurred over the last 24 months. All this progress makes us confident in our ability to raise more global wealth capital this year versus last. So ahead of budget. A final note on our Capital Solutions Business, ACS, with fee revenue generation has been strong and stable over the last several quarters. This business which is part of the flywheel is clicking for a variety of reasons, including greater demand for bespoke financing solutions, increasing integration and deployment across activity across the platform, and more organized and effective coverage of a variety of corporate clients. Through the first half of this year, we've syndicated over $6 billion across 100 plus institutional investors and are currently in the market with in excess of 30 transactions. As a bonus, we're reaching many investors who are new to the Apollo franchise through this indication, as many of our syndication partners have never invested in Apollo Fund prior. ACS has really been the integral part of our flywheel. And I want to emphasize one of the Marc\u2019s themes from earlier is one of the ways we partner with banks across a broader financial landscape. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin to go through our financial results.\nMartin Kelly: Great, thanks, Jim. I'll provide a bit more context on our financial results and outlook before we open it up for questions. So as Marc and Jim have both referenced, our second quarter results completed a very strong first half, and position us well to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. We've discussed how this year is one of execution, and you're seeing these efforts materialize in in a meaningful way. In the Asset Management segment, FRE revenues for the first half of the year, increased by 26% over the comparable period, FRE costs by 22% and overall FRE by 29%. The FRE margin increased by over 100 basis points as a consequence. In Retirement Services, Athene\u2019s business continues to exceed all our estimates with normalized SRE year-to-date growing in excess of 50% over the comparable period, aided by strong organic growth trends and an expanding net investment spread. Focusing on the second quarter and starting with our asset management business, our record quarterly FRE was anchored by fee related revenue growth of approximately 25% quarter-over-quarter. Within that management fees increased almost 20% and capital solutions fees remained very strong and tracking well ahead of our initial expectations for the full year. Total fee related expenses increased only modestly on a sequential basis, reflecting our commitment to disciplined expense management this year. Following growth in the comp expense line reflects a declining pace of hiring with just over 100 net new Apollo employees added in the first half of the year, some 40% of the headcount growth in the same period last year. The combination of strong revenue growth and decelerating cost growth drove more than 200 basis points of FRE margin expansion quarter-over-quarter, bringing our FRE margin to 55% in the first half of the year. Moving to retirement services, our record normalized SRE of $874 million increased 8% quarter-over-quarter, resulting in 166 basis points of normalized net spread. On a sequential basis, normalized net spread increased by five basis points due to higher falling rate income on the margin deployment spreads and yields on cash balances net of higher new business and financing costs. Earnings accretion from a higher interest rate environment has exceeded our initial projections in the first two quarters of this year. Looking forward, we expect normalized SRE in the second half of the year to approximate the amount we earned in the first half, reflecting four primary components. One, continued strong organic growth at a $60 billion plus annual pace. Two, current interest rate conditions, both interest rate levels and curve shape. Three, ADIP, the strategic third party capital, sidecar capital that we manage, supporting approximately 40% of total Athene inflows this year, including buying down origination from the first half. And four, a transaction with Venerable, which closed in July, with Venerable recaptured approximately $3 billion of older payout annuities. This transaction will be reflected as an outflow in the third quarter and will release capital for deployment into the strong new business environment. In connection with this transaction, we will recognize a benefit within SRE in the order of $50 million, that we will treat as a onetime notable item and exclude from normalized SRE. Corresponding to this SRE profile, we expect to normalize net spread to range between 160 and 165 basis points in the third and fourth quarters. This spread and earnings profile would result in approximately 30% year-over-year growth in normalized SRE in 2023. Assuming the current level and shape of the forward interest rate curve holds, and aid of supports a full pro rata share of Athene\u2019s incremental growth. We currently expect normalized SRE growth in 2024 to be in line with our longer term guidance of low double digit annualized growth. As it relates to credit quality, Athene continues to experience a very low level of asset impairments across its portfolio which aligns with its focus and high concentration in senior secured top of the capital structure credit. Since the beginning of 2020, a period that has included COVID-19, the Russia Ukraine war, the regional bank crisis, and a significant move higher in rates, Athene has incurred average annualized impairments of only 11 basis points, including just two basis points annualized in the most recent quarter, which is consistent with its long-term average of nine basis points. Overall, we believe Athene\u2019s credit profile remains very strong, and is well positioned to withstand a more difficult credit backdrop, if one were to emerge. In terms of capital allocation, we continue to assess how to best deploy free cash flow on a regular basis based on its highest returning is for shareholders. So far this year, we've allocated more capital towards share repurchases than strategic investments. Given the long term value we see in our stock price, as well as the abundance of organic growth initiatives we've highlighted, which create revenue growth without the need for capital. We've deployed over $230 million of capital towards opportunistic share repurchases in the first half of 2023. In addition to immunizing employees stock issuance, with a resulting reduction in our share count over the past two quarters from 599 to 595 million shares. And lastly, in response to some index eligibility questions we've received, it's worth noting that we reported positive GAAP earnings in the second quarter, as well as cumulatively over the last four quarters. This is the final S&P index eligibility criteria that needs to be satisfied. In terms of market taxonomy, Apollo is included within the Financial Services Industry Group, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard, reflecting our differentiated business mix, this classification places us within geographically unique position relative to our direct alternative asset management peers and underweight sector relative to the total market index. Combined with our leading governance characteristics, shareholder rates, earnings growth and long-term stock outperformance relative to the broader market, we believe that Apollo is well suited to be a core holding within investor portfolios. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Just a quickie on the originations. I mean, you have 16 for a reason, and not all of them are going to be clicking at once, but yet a full quarter of Atlas were hanging in the $100 billion of origination range on an annualized basis. What do you think takes us to the 150? Can you do it with the current suite of platforms you have, isn't just an environment thing. Just curious on your thoughts there. Thanks.\nMarc Rowan : Thanks Glenn. I think it's a combination of both. I think there is all 16 we are happy with the progress as you know, we really have not leaned into the consumer, we've really leaned into much more of the corporate. I think there's a secular opportunity. But I think the 16 we feel as we integrate them over time consistent risk, reporting, funding, financing, and the holistic approach, we still feel comfortable that the five year objective of the 150 that the 16 in are stable today, we think that they have the organic and secular growth, we don't really feel we need to add a lot more. There may be some consolidation in a few of those for optimization. But we feel very comfortable that we have the strategic lead, and the strategic organization from which to get to our five year goals with what we put together today.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. So the supply of investment opportunities is clearly rising from the banking crisis. We talked a little bit about that last quarter. And clearly there's more evidence of that this quarter, can you talk a little more about the demand for destock of investment strategies specifically for I guess, private investment grade credit, historically, that's largely been taken out by insurance clients, I think Marc, you highlighted that there's an opportunity to extend beyond non-insurance client base. So I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that, and how that informs your go forward third party fundraising strategy? Thanks.\nJim Zelter: Yes, let me take a deep dive. And maybe Marc has a couple comments, Alex. Like as Marc described history, private credit, is a big word big concept. It's been narrowly executed with leveraged lending. When you see what's going on with the banks and the funding crisis, which became then really a profitability challenge. There\u2019re really two large areas of opportunity. One is there are clearly assets that do not belong today on their balance sheet. Look at the dispositions that PacWest made. We did a secured financing, there was literally AAA risk and almost 10%. A few other folks bought portfolios. So the selling of portfolios is one activity, and that will continue over the next several years as they optimize their balance sheets. The larger opportunity is the secular business organization, there are lines of business where they are in, where they have been the day to day originator and purveyor of credit to companies. And those are businesses because their cost of capital change, and has changed, and their liquidity and the regulatory changes that this do not make sense as an operating business. So you have a business sector, which is origination, you have a disposition, we're going to be active in both of those. And there's partnerships that we are in and that will create on both sides of the ledger.\nMarc Rowan : And Alex, just to complete the thought, insurance companies have for a very long time been buyers of private placements, but they've done it in a very, very narrow way. If you're in the retirement services business, they are more broadly in the insurance business. And your opportunity set is solely investment grade corporates, you have no competitive edge in the investment landscape, you are looking for a solution. And that solution is beyond what I'll call the traditional private placement market. But the insurance market is growing, it's well acceptance of investment grade private credit. And this is about execution. The other interesting opportunity is we as an industry have basically spent the last 35 years serving the small alternatives bucket of our large institutional clients. We have an opportunity at the investment grade side to serve the fixed income bucket of our large institutional clients. This is in the very early stages. And it's always interesting to go in and see these accounts. First question we asked is a single A rated private credit an alternative? They haven't been confronted with that question today. If they think it's an alternative, they're not right for the opportunity, because then they're comparing it against things that are in 20% rates of return. If they think it is not an alternative, and they think it is just fixed income, then it is offering 200 to 300 basis points above their fixed income. We are in the early days of an education process. And I believe that the market for private investment grade could be as large outside the insurance industry as it is inside the insurance industry.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning, everyone. The Q-over-Q change in the kind of retail annuity sales channels, I think worse than many expected, given what we've seen in others in the marketplace. And you mentioned you're leaving some business on the table for various reasons. So do you think this is a share loss issue or there's something else you could point to that explained the divergence with what we've seen from some of the other annuity guys? Thanks.\nMarc Rowan : This is a high quality problem, Patrick. We have as I mentioned, four channels. We have the retail channel, we have the PRT channel, we have the reinsurance channel, and we have the funding agreement channel, all of which are organic. And one could also look at reinsurance as being onshore and then offshore given the progress we're making in Japan and Asia. We have therefore made choices about business. We thought we would do substantially more business this year than last year. Recall that last year was some $48 billion of organic inflows, we're now confirming and essentially providing guidance that we will do north of $60 billion. And I believe that we are leaving between $10 billion and $20 billion on the table. But in the context of the budget, that we put out that internally, some $60 billion, we have the luxury of choosing the highest quality business, the right business mix, the right profile of liabilities, and the right net spread. So most of the business that was left on the table in the quarter was I call transactional. Transactional does not mean bad. It just means we elected to do other business versus transactional business. And [MIGAS] is our primarily transactional business. Anytime we want to add MIGAS, we can add MIGAS, we chose not to for the quarter given that we were already doing $19 billion of organic inflows.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Brown of KBW.\nMichael Brown: Okay, great. So appreciate the updates on the, updated views on the normalized FRE as we look out to 2024. Obviously, the activities have really robust across the platform, I guess, kind of following up on that retail channel question. How do you expect activity to hold up as you get into the kind of rate cutting cycle that the forward curve does expect? I understand that's baked into your guidance today. But is it fair to assume that the demand stays high and then obviously, the Tier 2 business has been picking up and just interested to hear thoughts about how the opportunity there could evolve?\nMarc Rowan : Look, it is clear to us that consumers prefer higher rates to lower rates. Consumers have not particularly retirees have not had good options to finance their retirement, now they do, and you're seeing it across the board in the annuity market. To think that annuities are not impacted by interest rates, it's just to ignore the obvious. What's happening to us is actually quite interesting. We are growing in a growing annuity market. But we're also in the midst of growing our distribution. Each of the last few years, we have added immense new distribution banking partners, we will add the largest or second largest provider of annuities in this country. At some point, this, I think we this quarter, and that will not mature till a year from now. And then we have two or three other very large providers coming on. So I do think the overall market share for retail will be impacted by rates if in fact rates go down. That doesn't mean negative or substantially negative, but it will have on the margin be a negative force. Having said that, our distribution is still building so quickly, that I doubt we will see any real decline in retail. More interesting to me, is also the diversity of channels. PRT is gathering speed, high rates or higher rates are really causing all plans who are close to fully funded status to consider derisking. And even those that were inequity are thinking of taking chips off the table given the very shallow rally, let's say in equities. So I expect PRT to be very, very active over the next few years, US and overseas. Japan, as I've mentioned on previous quarters is exactly where we want it to be. It's on track. And I think reinsurance is also going to be a very important part of our business. So in summary, I think we're leaving business on the table this year. And I am optimistic that notwithstanding the forward curve, we will see continued increases in business.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just circling back to private wealth, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the traction that you're seeing across the products in the private wealth channel, the distribution builds out, as well as how you're thinking about the pipeline of strategies to bring to the market next. Would also be curious, any sort of lessons learned that you take away from some of the earlier products that you had brought it to the private wealth channel?\nJim Zelter: Yes, Michael, let me give you a little bit of a tour. I mean it's been 36 months plus or minus, since we really laid out the objectives. And certainly in terms of products, I think bucketing them into three areas, the existing flagship products that we had, and creating the right types of vehicles and feeders for the large wires and others. Then there was a second obviously creating a variety of yield products, whether private BDC, and private REIT and others, but again, not only for the traditional Global Wealth channels, Morgan Stanley and BVA, et cetera, but also the independent IBD channels, the RIA channels. And then the third big bucket is newer products like our AAA product, which we are very excited with the momentum. So I think we feel we have the product set, not only in the US, but globally. But I think the lessons really are I mean, certainly we want to and we expect and the clients expect strong investment performance, like we've done for 33 years. But the use of technology, the use of education, Apollo Academy, in particular, those are all and the ability to service. Those are all the full service products that our partners are expecting out of us. We see the puck going in Global Wealth having a tremendous impact on our business. It's a big secular trend, it really parallels what we see going on in private credit. And one if you look takes a broad step back around the globe. In terms of demographics, in terms of savers, in terms of vehicles, we think there's a massive amount of whitespace. We have been broadly embraced. The market wants alternatives, for alternatives in providers, as well as products. So I think the early lessons are it's not just about performance, it\u2019s a, you need to bring all your skills to the marketplace, you cannot underestimate the service needs, the technology needs and the education needs. So it's really a full service effort across our firm and everything we've done we've had to replicate and but huge opportunity globally.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much. Wanted to get your thoughts around the potential longer term outlook for the normalized net spread, you're expecting it to only trend down slightly in the second half of the year. I guess I'm most curious around where exactly you think the net spreads can settle out longer term and whether you can offset potential spread compression with higher percentage of originations from platforms through being more selective around new business, and the backlog running off at low at net spreads, any detail that would be great. Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: So Rufus, it's one, we, I guess we just still the spread conversation into normalizes, top line spread, which is 160 basis points plus or minus. And then that falls through after costs and financing and so on. So 115 basis points. And so we've clearly seen some benefit in there from rates as well as higher growth and higher at the margin deployment. We do -- we target business, which at the margin derives, and that's spread in the order of 115 basis points. We have a question, which we're addressing internally now, which is the right exposure? And how do we hedge it which we'll walk through an update on but we look at net spread. And that's what we focus on given the growth profile, and given the contribution from beta. And given where we think we can deploy incremental growth that also combines to SRE dollar guidance number of low double digit, which is what we're focused on next year and thereafter.\nMarc Rowan : Next year will also include the full benefit or full detriment depending on your point of, ADIP being fully ramped and taking its full share. So it's more of the business will-- more of the SRE will go to ADIP on a comparable basis in \u201824 versus \u201823. And all that is factored into Martin's guidance.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Benjamin Budish of Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: Hey, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you mentioned some whitespace opportunities earlier in the prepared remarks. And it's been a hot summer, I'm just thinking about the clean energy transition strategy. And I was wondering if you can kind of give us a refresher of like, where you are, but more importantly, how you think that can evolve over the next say, like 5-10 years as a potential strategy that could really scale in the way that some of your other like major drawdown fund strategies have scaled?\nMarc Rowan : Thank you. Thanks for the question. It's Marc, look, we look at this, and we and our peer group and the banking system, quite frankly, we're going to be financing energy transition movements towards sustainability for the rest of our professional careers. The scale of money required, just like nothing else we've ever seen. And so we step back, and we think about what that is, what kind of money, is it equity? Is it debt? Is it hybrid? When we look at the market, most of what we see is debt and hybrid. Our goal is to build the leading financier of energy transition sustainability worldwide. By having put together a perpetual, evergreen fund focused on doing that. In addition, we will raise bespoke drawdown equity funds from time to time. But those will be in my opinion, smaller than the opportunity that we see. We announced either last quarter or at the beginning of the year, that we had made an initial funding and initial capitalization with a few billion dollars of seed capital, that capital is getting deployed quite rapidly. A pipeline is growing. And I expect this vehicle to have the potential to be among the largest vehicles on our platform. But let's get the money invested that we have first, let's show investors that we've done a good job with it. Let's really define the types of opportunities and the return requirements. But I am equally optimistic that there's a great opportunity here but it's a debt and hybrid opportunity primarily.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Adam Beatty of UBS.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you. And good morning. Nice to deal with yellow and wanted to broaden that out into maybe potential opportunity in restructuring and distressed assets in situations. Which seems like it could be a sweet spot for Apollo. Firstly, in terms of the backdrop, so far, the level of corporate distress has been maybe a little bit more benign than folks expected. So wondering what you're seeing and kind of the near term outlook for that. And then maybe some details on how Apollo was positioned and how much you might want to lean into that opportunity. Thank you.\nJim Zelter: Well, I mean, I would start up I say we agree, we, it's been the credit markets have been, overall benign. And when we see where the economy is going in terms of cost of capital, our view is you are going to see more companies having a bit of a challenge in \u201824 and \u201825, especially with the maturity wall. But as we've talked about, in this call so much of our business right now, the lion's share of our business vast majority is to investment grade counterparties. And we feel very good about the health and robust nature of those companies. Certainly we have roots in history, in our hybrid and our equity business of doing things is the market in terms more challenging. We expect to be at the top of the heap and doing that but in a measured thoughtful way, like we've done for 30 years. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gunn for closing comment.\nNoah Gunn: Thanks very much for your help this morning, Danna. And thanks to everyone else for joining and your continued interest in our business. If you have any follow up questions regarding anything discussed on today's call, please feel free to reach out to us and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Enjoy the rest of your summer.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time.

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great, thanks, Jim. I'll provide a bit more context on our financial results and outlook before we open it up for questions. So as Marc and Jim have both referenced, our second quarter results completed a very strong first half, and position us well to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. We've discussed how this year is one of execution, and you're seeing these efforts materialize in in a meaningful way. In the Asset Management segment, FRE revenues for the first half of the year, increased by 26% over the comparable period, FRE costs by 22% and overall FRE by 29%. The FRE margin increased by over 100 basis points as a consequence. In Retirement Services, Athene\u2019s business continues to exceed all our estimates with normalized SRE year-to-date growing in excess of 50% over the comparable period, aided by strong organic growth trends and an expanding net investment spread. Focusing on the second quarter and starting with our asset management business, our record quarterly FRE was anchored by fee related revenue growth of approximately 25% quarter-over-quarter. Within that management fees increased almost 20% and capital solutions fees remained very strong and tracking well ahead of our initial expectations for the full year. Total fee related expenses increased only modestly on a sequential basis, reflecting our commitment to disciplined expense management this year. Following growth in the comp expense line reflects a declining pace of hiring with just over 100 net new Apollo employees added in the first half of the year, some 40% of the headcount growth in the same period last year. The combination of strong revenue growth and decelerating cost growth drove more than 200 basis points of FRE margin expansion quarter-over-quarter, bringing our FRE margin to 55% in the first half of the year. Moving to retirement services, our record normalized SRE of $874 million increased 8% quarter-over-quarter, resulting in 166 basis points of normalized net spread. On a sequential basis, normalized net spread increased by five basis points due to higher falling rate income on the margin deployment spreads and yields on cash balances net of higher new business and financing costs. Earnings accretion from a higher interest rate environment has exceeded our initial projections in the first two quarters of this year. Looking forward, we expect normalized SRE in the second half of the year to approximate the amount we earned in the first half, reflecting four primary components. One, continued strong organic growth at a $60 billion plus annual pace. Two, current interest rate conditions, both interest rate levels and curve shape. Three, ADIP, the strategic third party capital, sidecar capital that we manage, supporting approximately 40% of total Athene inflows this year, including buying down origination from the first half. And four, a transaction with Venerable, which closed in July, with Venerable recaptured approximately $3 billion of older payout annuities. This transaction will be reflected as an outflow in the third quarter and will release capital for deployment into the strong new business environment. In connection with this transaction, we will recognize a benefit within SRE in the order of $50 million, that we will treat as a onetime notable item and exclude from normalized SRE. Corresponding to this SRE profile, we expect to normalize net spread to range between 160 and 165 basis points in the third and fourth quarters. This spread and earnings profile would result in approximately 30% year-over-year growth in normalized SRE in 2023. Assuming the current level and shape of the forward interest rate curve holds, and aid of supports a full pro rata share of Athene\u2019s incremental growth. We currently expect normalized SRE growth in 2024 to be in line with our longer term guidance of low double digit annualized growth. As it relates to credit quality, Athene continues to experience a very low level of asset impairments across its portfolio which aligns with its focus and high concentration in senior secured top of the capital structure credit. Since the beginning of 2020, a period that has included COVID-19, the Russia Ukraine war, the regional bank crisis, and a significant move higher in rates, Athene has incurred average annualized impairments of only 11 basis points, including just two basis points annualized in the most recent quarter, which is consistent with its long-term average of nine basis points. Overall, we believe Athene\u2019s credit profile remains very strong, and is well positioned to withstand a more difficult credit backdrop, if one were to emerge. In terms of capital allocation, we continue to assess how to best deploy free cash flow on a regular basis based on its highest returning is for shareholders. So far this year, we've allocated more capital towards share repurchases than strategic investments. Given the long term value we see in our stock price, as well as the abundance of organic growth initiatives we've highlighted, which create revenue growth without the need for capital. We've deployed over $230 million of capital towards opportunistic share repurchases in the first half of 2023. In addition to immunizing employees stock issuance, with a resulting reduction in our share count over the past two quarters from 599 to 595 million shares. And lastly, in response to some index eligibility questions we've received, it's worth noting that we reported positive GAAP earnings in the second quarter, as well as cumulatively over the last four quarters. This is the final S&P index eligibility criteria that needs to be satisfied. In terms of market taxonomy, Apollo is included within the Financial Services Industry Group, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard, reflecting our differentiated business mix, this classification places us within geographically unique position relative to our direct alternative asset management peers and underweight sector relative to the total market index. Combined with our leading governance characteristics, shareholder rates, earnings growth and long-term stock outperformance relative to the broader market, we believe that Apollo is well suited to be a core holding within investor portfolios. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. So Rufus, it's one, we, I guess we just still the spread conversation into normalizes, top line spread, which is 160 basis points plus or minus. And then that falls through after costs and financing and so on. So 115 basis points. And so we've clearly seen some benefit in there from rates as well as higher growth and higher at the margin deployment. We do -- we target business, which at the margin derives, and that's spread in the order of 115 basis points. We have a question, which we're addressing internally now, which is the right exposure? And how do we hedge it which we'll walk through an update on but we look at net spread. And that's what we focus on given the growth profile, and given the contribution from beta. And given where we think we can deploy incremental growth that also combines to SRE dollar guidance number of low double digit, which is what we're focused on next year and thereafter."

            "name": "Jim Zelter",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. Marc did a great job outlining our competitive positioning and our vision. And now we'll spend a few minutes translating how some of these important themes are playing throughout our firm with investment environment, our investment performance and fundraising. It's clear to us and like many of you as well, the demand for private credit solutions has risen significantly, as higher cost of capital has reduced the availability of traditional financing sources. We believe we're uniquely positioned to address this need for a few reasons, the scale of our capital resources, the speed of execution and the sophistication and creativity of our investment underwriting. We are continuing to diligently build the largest alternative credit business in the industry. And our success today is attributable to the expansive capabilities, or what we call the Apollo toolbox. From corporate sponsors and everything else in between. We can flexibly serve clients that need capital in a collaborative and bespoke manner. Across Apollo, we are helping healthy and growing companies who are hamstrung by a limited open public market. The second quarter was a prime example of this, a period that started with the fallout from the regional bank crisis and ended with the markets feeling a bit more accommodating. As you might expect, we were particularly active and then deployed nearly $35 billion of capital across our platform during the quarter. Much of this activity was driven by the yield business across our various sourcing channels, including financing solutions to corporates, which we call high grade Alpha. Our origination platforms, as well as more traditional origination through strategies such as large cap direct lending, or leveraged lending, CRE debt and a variety of structured credit CLO origination. In an extremely active quarter, one of the signature financing solutions we provided was for company Wolfspeed, a silicon carbide materials and device manufacturer. We led an investment group that provided a $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion secured note to the company as they undertook a significant growth initiative to meet accelerating demand. In this case, we work with Wolfspeed to structure a non-dilutive and flexible credit solution, which resulted in a unique win-win for the company's debt and equity investors. And another example of capabilities that happened more recently, we partnered with our client and our partner, Air France-KLM, one of the world's leading airlines, following the execution of two successful innovative equity capital transactions with Air France, we announced last week that we've entered into an exclusive discussion to provide a EUR 1.5 billion capital solution through funds we manage and insurance affiliates to Air France-KLM\u2019s Flying Blue Loyalty program. Flying Blue is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs, and this transaction would further bolster the company's already strong capital position. We are proud to say that this would be the third of a unique series of capital solutions to aid Air-France KLM, increasing our total capital support to the company to more than EUR 2.5 billion over the last 12 months. Amid our expanding opportunity set to originate investment grade assets, debt origination activity across our 16 platforms remains strong. Notably, the acquisition of Atlas SP Partners, the former CS business, the newest and largest asset backed financing platform in our portfolio is now fully closed with both client and employee retention rates exceeding our expectations. Atlas has been extremely active in the market executing over 30 securitizations since March, and has substantial near term pipeline. Some of the larger, other larger platforms, namely MidCap and Wheels are writing business at attractive spreads, and generating ROEs in the mid to high teens range. While we've been actively deploying capital, we continue to prioritize generating excess return per unit of risk. Investment performance remains strong and consistent in the quarter. Marc touched on the equity business and I'd like to add our direct origination, corporate credit and structured credit strategies, portfolios appreciated 4%, 3% and 2% respectively in the second quarter with each category outperforming indexes we benchmark in the same period. Performance across hybrid strategies also have been solid with hybrid value and our more opportunistic credit strategies, each returning in excess of 4% for the quarter. Through a period of weaker public market performance last year, and some instability in the first half of the year driving strong investment performance over the past year has not been easy. Through that lens, it's worth highlighting a few strategies in particular, ADS, our non-traded BDC we manage, Redding Ridge, our CLO originator or Core Plus, our multi asset opportunistic credit offering and Structured Credit Recovery Fund IV have all outperformed relevant indexes over the last 12 months. Turning our focus to fundraising, we generated a record organic inflow of $35 billion, driven by strong momentum at Athene as well as a third party asset management business. Across third party, we raised $15 billion in this specific quarter, with an additional $8 billion slipping into the first few weeks of this current quarter. The investments we made over the last 24 months to expand into adjacencies and whitespace opportunities, such as secondaries and clean transition, and ones where we believe we have a strategic edge, such as third party insurance and global wealth have begun to pay off. Some of the areas where we've seen recent momentum include third party insurance, where we've developed a comprehensive client coverage network to ensure coordination across all parts of the firm, and establish a curated solution set for this fast growing client type. We think our expertise in managing retirement service balance sheets, on both the asset and liability side is a meaningful differentiator in this market. And we're continuing to be very bullish on the long-term global growth opportunities in this business. Next is our sidecar initiative, where we raised over $4 billion across four sidecars so far this year, and sidecars enable institutional investors to invest alongside various investment strategies, mostly credit related with greater scale and flexibility than they would otherwise achieve in a coming of fund. This type of structure is growing trend and a great way to partner with more sophisticated investors. We have a strong pipeline in the sidecar opportunities across the global institutional investor base for the remainder of \u201823 supported with a dialogue of over 60 investors. And finally, capital raised from individual investors to continues to be a strategic priority. Through the substantial investment we've made in the new product creation and distribution expansion. We built a diverse global wealth platform by asset class, product structure, distribution channel, and geographic reach, all of which has helped migrate recent market driven headwinds. We're focused on continuing to broaden our retail focused product suite and continue to expect launching one to two products each quarter into 2024. In terms of distribution expansion, we've made some notable progress for Apollo aligned alternatives AAA specifically, which is now offered on five bank platforms, and has additional global US and non-US banks, as well as RIAs and other wealth channels in the second half of the year. We've also seen a monthly inflow into Apollo Debt Solutions. I mentioned our non-traded credit PDC we manage, ramp following the strong investment performance, and this occurred over the last 24 months. All this progress makes us confident in our ability to raise more global wealth capital this year versus last. So ahead of budget. A final note on our Capital Solutions Business, ACS, with fee revenue generation has been strong and stable over the last several quarters. This business which is part of the flywheel is clicking for a variety of reasons, including greater demand for bespoke financing solutions, increasing integration and deployment across activity across the platform, and more organized and effective coverage of a variety of corporate clients. Through the first half of this year, we've syndicated over $6 billion across 100 plus institutional investors and are currently in the market with in excess of 30 transactions. As a bonus, we're reaching many investors who are new to the Apollo franchise through this indication, as many of our syndication partners have never invested in Apollo Fund prior. ACS has really been the integral part of our flywheel. And I want to emphasize one of the Marc\u2019s themes from earlier is one of the ways we partner with banks across a broader financial landscape. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin to go through our financial results. Yes, let me take a deep dive. And maybe Marc has a couple comments, Alex. Like as Marc described history, private credit, is a big word big concept. It's been narrowly executed with leveraged lending. When you see what's going on with the banks and the funding crisis, which became then really a profitability challenge. There\u2019re really two large areas of opportunity. One is there are clearly assets that do not belong today on their balance sheet. Look at the dispositions that PacWest made. We did a secured financing, there was literally AAA risk and almost 10%. A few other folks bought portfolios. So the selling of portfolios is one activity, and that will continue over the next several years as they optimize their balance sheets. The larger opportunity is the secular business organization, there are lines of business where they are in, where they have been the day to day originator and purveyor of credit to companies. And those are businesses because their cost of capital change, and has changed, and their liquidity and the regulatory changes that this do not make sense as an operating business. So you have a business sector, which is origination, you have a disposition, we're going to be active in both of those. And there's partnerships that we are in and that will create on both sides of the ledger. Yes, Michael, let me give you a little bit of a tour. I mean it's been 36 months plus or minus, since we really laid out the objectives. And certainly in terms of products, I think bucketing them into three areas, the existing flagship products that we had, and creating the right types of vehicles and feeders for the large wires and others. Then there was a second obviously creating a variety of yield products, whether private BDC, and private REIT and others, but again, not only for the traditional Global Wealth channels, Morgan Stanley and BVA, et cetera, but also the independent IBD channels, the RIA channels. And then the third big bucket is newer products like our AAA product, which we are very excited with the momentum. So I think we feel we have the product set, not only in the US, but globally. But I think the lessons really are I mean, certainly we want to and we expect and the clients expect strong investment performance, like we've done for 33 years. But the use of technology, the use of education, Apollo Academy, in particular, those are all and the ability to service. Those are all the full service products that our partners are expecting out of us. We see the puck going in Global Wealth having a tremendous impact on our business. It's a big secular trend, it really parallels what we see going on in private credit. And one if you look takes a broad step back around the globe. In terms of demographics, in terms of savers, in terms of vehicles, we think there's a massive amount of whitespace. We have been broadly embraced. The market wants alternatives, for alternatives in providers, as well as products. So I think the early lessons are it's not just about performance, it\u2019s a, you need to bring all your skills to the marketplace, you cannot underestimate the service needs, the technology needs and the education needs. So it's really a full service effort across our firm and everything we've done we've had to replicate and but huge opportunity globally. Well, I mean, I would start up I say we agree, we, it's been the credit markets have been, overall benign. And when we see where the economy is going in terms of cost of capital, our view is you are going to see more companies having a bit of a challenge in \u201824 and \u201825, especially with the maturity wall. But as we've talked about, in this call so much of our business right now, the lion's share of our business vast majority is to investment grade counterparties. And we feel very good about the health and robust nature of those companies. Certainly we have roots in history, in our hybrid and our equity business of doing things is the market in terms more challenging. We expect to be at the top of the heap and doing that but in a measured thoughtful way, like we've done for 30 years. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gunn for closing comment."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thanks Noah, and we all can wish for certain things and hope that they come through. In any event, as no Noah said it was truly a very, very strong quarter, normalized SRE and FRE of $1.3 billion for the quarter. And we are on track to earn FRE and normalize SRE of ,$5 billion plus minus for the year which Martin will detail. One thing worth calling out is just how exceptionally strong SRE has been. Just to put in context, Athene has now grown or will grow 30% SRE two years in a row, and they actually have hit their 2026 financial target as laid out in our Investor Day some two years ago, in just two years. Not only are they doing an exceptional job, but clearly Jim and Grant and the team have exceptionally sandbagged everyone, and the business continues to be very strong. In addition to financial results, we had record inflows for the quarter on an organic basis, we had some $43 billion of inflows including $8 billion that closed shortly after the quarter end. This closing shortly after quarter end is actually a feature of the alternatives business. Many of our institutional investors prefer to close on the first of the month, and have something in another out -- another quarter from an allocation point of view rather than in the prior month. And for many of our retail High Net Worth Focused Funds, they also close on the first of the month. So I expect that we will be a little more careful and giving guidance quarter by quarter to account for how this business actually operates. From my point of view, and as Martin and we have discussed previously, we generated positive operating leverage and margin expansion this quarter. And we expect this to continue over the next couple of years as we benefit from the investments that we've made in people and facilities and upgrading our business over the past few years. In short, our strategic positioning is excellent. And anchored by three really simple principles. One purchase price matter. The second excess return per unit of risk. That is what we do, and full alignment with our clients, both our institutional and our retail clients. It actually feels pretty good. Having not chased the hot dot during an era of money printing and zero rates. Our opportunity set is just different than that of our peer group. Apollo has momentum. In terms of the business, let me start for the quarter and with the equity business, in the equity business this year has really marked the end of an era. So if I think about what happened over the prior decade, and perhaps longer than a decade, there were these incredible tailwinds in the equity business, tailwinds from money printing, pulling forward of demand, fiscal stimulus, and certainly from zero rates. We now find ourselves in an absence of tailwinds rates are higher, growth is slower. Globalization is in retreat. People will have to go back to investing the old fashioned way. They'll actually have to be very good investors; they will need to produce alpha. I believe that's what we've been doing. Demonstrated by the recent private equity results. The final close for Fund X in mid-July, brought in capital, just around $20 billion over a 12-month marketing period versus continuing to market over an extended timeline. The fund is now closed. Fund IX generated 36% gross IRR, 24% net IRR. In the quarter, just a really interesting time in the private equity business between haves and have nots. Our Arconic and Univar are two very large financings, which certainly came at it time that was challenging for the market both executed better than expected giving us increased confidence in the ability to get transactions we like done. Let me move on from the equity business and talk about the two drivers of the quarter and what I expect to drive the rest of the year. First private credit. As I've said previously, private credit, these are two words that actually mean nothing. Private credit can be investment grade, private credit can be Triple C. Barriers to entry in the private credit business are either quite low, anyone with a fund, and a staff capable of evaluating investments can truly enter the private credit business, or barriers to entry can be extraordinarily high. And building a full ecosystem that allows you to serve the needs of your clients in a very sophisticated way. Think of the difference between a hotdog stand and a Michelin star restaurant, both are in the food business, and both serve food. That is how we think about private credit. And where people are positioned. Financial markets, financial literacy around private credit has actually gotten quite sloppy. What is private credit? Well, if we start in the abstract, everything that is on a bank balance sheet is private credit. But most of the time, market pundits talk about private credit. They're talking about a very small sliver of a private credit universe that's focused on levered lending. Don't get me wrong, we liked the levered lending business. Levered lending is actually a terrific business right now. It will not always be a terrific business. It is a cyclical business with low barriers to entry. But one that at the right point in time, can be very lucrative. What we have tried to build is not a single fund, is not a single opportunity. We've tried to build an ecosystem. By reflect on the past decade, we've invested some $8 billion building 16 origination platforms. There are 4,000 people who work in these platforms, not Apollo employees, who are solely focused every single day on originating private credit. And as you know, much, much if not most of what they do is investment grade. That's important because the investment grade market is at least 8 times larger than the high yield market and 8 times larger than the levered lending market. This is a great time for private credit. This is not a quarter, that's a great time for private credit. This is secular change. Not only do we have higher base rates and regulatory change and change in market dynamics, we are in the beginning of a secular shift in how credit is provided to businesses and a shift that I believe will continue to gather speed. To be successful in this market, you need a recurring supply of unique origination. This quarter we originated some $23 billion with 50% of that from platforms. Jim Zelter will detail some of these transactions. But in addition to the names you would expect that are traditionally associated with private credit, AT&T, Air France and the Novia. Borrowers value, certainty, scale, and speed to execution. In addition to origination, you need an integrated capital markets business. Because after all, we want 25% of everything, and 100% of nothing. Our ACS business led by Craig Farr has done an extraordinary job extending our reach of private credit to clients and to non-clients. In fact, this is among the greatest ways that we introduce the firm to people who are not yet clients of Apollo and show them what we're capable of. This quarter, we raised some $7 billion of capital from third party insurers. And we expect this to gather speed as the market continues to improve. For private credit, particularly investment grade, the way that consumers and businesses borrow is traditionally through the asset backed market. Asset backed is for the most part, private credit. This is a $20 trillion market, and one in which we have been playing for a very, very long time. More than $220 billion of volume to date, better than 200 relationships. We have currently more than $100 billion of AUM associated with ABF, $55 billion of which is third party. Most of what happens for us in ABF is investment grade and it is a key driver of our insurance business for Athene and for our third party insurance clients and increasingly for fixed income replacement for our traditional institutional clients. One of the single most important factors in this market is that we are completely aligned with our client base. We own what they own at the same time at the same price. There is nothing that is more confidence inspiring than alignment. Let me move on from private credit to talk a little bit about the job Athene did in the quarter. Athene\u2019s results are in part driven by the ability of Apollo to source attractive investment grade credit, but also by the incredibly talented team that has been building Athene for the past 14 years. Normalized SRE for the quarter was $874 million, and normalized net spread was 166 basis points truly the widest I can remember. $19 billion of organic inflows in the quarter, up more than 50% year-over-year, number one annuity market share. We now have line of sight to more than $60 billion of organic inflows this year. We are leaving by some estimates between $10 billion and $20 billion of annual originations on the table. Truly, we have an opportunity now to be selective, and to build recurring franchises. We made progress this quarter in Japan, through our reinsurance business, and elsewhere in Asia. And I believe the business at Athene is gathering speed. Although, as I've cautioned in prior quarters, as I'm sure Martin will detail, these are truly exceptionally good times. And we are beneficiaries of the large floating rate position that we have carried for more than a decade. Also recall that our business is built at the top of the capital structure on a senior secured basis, and we sleep better at night. Credit experience in the quarter was incredibly benign, less than two basis points, which I'm sure Martin will detail. Surrenders or outflows also came in better than forecast. And if you recall from the chart we've included in this quarter as well as prior quarters as well as the education we've been doing. The primary driver of surrenders is not what happens at any point in time and interest rates. It is the timing of the expiration of programs that we put on three and five years ago, and for the most part is highly predictable. It is difficult to imagine going from startup or new business to where Athene is today. Right now we have not done an inorganic transaction for a number of years. But we are the beneficiary of four very diverse channels, retail, PRT, reinsurance, and funding agreements. All four of those channels are dependent on a stable and high quality credit rating. And having an infrastructure and a scale and an operating expense ratio that allow you to leverage the business. We could not have built the business we have today in organically in a high rate environment. We were fortunate in a low rate environment to have been able to purchase inorganic blocks. At a time when their contract rates were above market rates therefore our risk of surrender was very low. In contrast, in today's market, someone buying an inorganic block is actually buying a block where surrender charges and market value adjustments have degraded and is at much greater risk of a melting ice cube. In short, it is not a stable base on which to build the business and will make it very difficult for people to achieve the kind of scale we have achieved. Recall that we bought in Athene for some $11 billion at acquisition and Athena will earn $3.1 billion plus minus of normalized SRE for the fiscal year. In short, the team is doing an incredible job and distribution and maturation and product has not yet even matured. There is more to come. An effort to keep on time. Let me focus on one last topic, which I know it's been of interest to people, really want to talk about the market environment, particularly the regulatory environment, and the environment as it relates to our banking peers. In short, we have never had such a collaborative dialogue with the banking system. We have gone from not only being a great customer and partner of the banking system to a true collaborator. The shape of our business, particularly our willingness to do very large investment grade transactions, has made us an indispensable partner. And I do mean partner with the banking system. While some talk about the dancing of this being a great time for private credit, I've noticed that there's actually been dancing on both sides both on the bank and the private credit side as most banks put in an extraordinarily good quarter, and are on their way to an extraordinarily good year. We are also very symbiotic. Recall that we want the asset, but do not want what the bank typically wants, which is the customer. The bank wants the customer and typically does not want most of or any of the asset. If I step back, the US financial system is the envy of the world. We raise 50% of the world's capital. And part of the reason we are the envy of the world is the structure of our system. Banks have their role, and the investment marketplace has its role. Our system has all types of participants. But the vast, vast majority of those participants borrow short and invest long or have short term money. Think of an open ended mutual fund, which has daily liquidity, many hedge funds, quarterly liquidity, banks, daily liquidity at least on deposits, the ability to bring institutional investors retirement systems and insurance companies who have long dated liabilities or long dated assets to this market, make them ideal partners for the short dated capital of the banking system and the open ended mutual funds. In short, long term locked in liabilities are a source of stability and somewhat counter cyclical for our financial system. It does not matter whether they are in funds, which are themselves very stable, or they are on retirement services balance sheet. Totality of the market from the investor side does no maturity transformation, has no access to the Fed window, does not benefit from US government guarantee. And in our case, if you look at the Retirement Services balance sheet, we hold more Tier 1 capital and more Tier 2 capital than the vast majority of the top 10 banks in the US. We do cash flow testing and scenario testing and provide a granularity to our portfolio that very few institutions, if any can match. Our balance sheet is much more investment grade than the typical depository institution. In short, our model is highly complementary the banking system, we have never been more collaborative. And I expect this collaboration to increase as regulatory change gathers pace both in the US, Europe, and even the beginnings of regulatory change in Asia. As we're nearing the end of summer, the team is in great shape, and focused on executing the plan. We are sticking with no new toys, the upside from simply executing what's in front of us is incredibly strong. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim. Thanks Glenn. I think it's a combination of both. I think there is all 16 we are happy with the progress as you know, we really have not leaned into the consumer, we've really leaned into much more of the corporate. I think there's a secular opportunity. But I think the 16 we feel as we integrate them over time consistent risk, reporting, funding, financing, and the holistic approach, we still feel comfortable that the five year objective of the 150 that the 16 in are stable today, we think that they have the organic and secular growth, we don't really feel we need to add a lot more. There may be some consolidation in a few of those for optimization. But we feel very comfortable that we have the strategic lead, and the strategic organization from which to get to our five year goals with what we put together today. And Alex, just to complete the thought, insurance companies have for a very long time been buyers of private placements, but they've done it in a very, very narrow way. If you're in the retirement services business, they are more broadly in the insurance business. And your opportunity set is solely investment grade corporates, you have no competitive edge in the investment landscape, you are looking for a solution. And that solution is beyond what I'll call the traditional private placement market. But the insurance market is growing, it's well acceptance of investment grade private credit. And this is about execution. The other interesting opportunity is we as an industry have basically spent the last 35 years serving the small alternatives bucket of our large institutional clients. We have an opportunity at the investment grade side to serve the fixed income bucket of our large institutional clients. This is in the very early stages. And it's always interesting to go in and see these accounts. First question we asked is a single A rated private credit an alternative? They haven't been confronted with that question today. If they think it's an alternative, they're not right for the opportunity, because then they're comparing it against things that are in 20% rates of return. If they think it is not an alternative, and they think it is just fixed income, then it is offering 200 to 300 basis points above their fixed income. We are in the early days of an education process. And I believe that the market for private investment grade could be as large outside the insurance industry as it is inside the insurance industry. This is a high quality problem, Patrick. We have as I mentioned, four channels. We have the retail channel, we have the PRT channel, we have the reinsurance channel, and we have the funding agreement channel, all of which are organic. And one could also look at reinsurance as being onshore and then offshore given the progress we're making in Japan and Asia. We have therefore made choices about business. We thought we would do substantially more business this year than last year. Recall that last year was some $48 billion of organic inflows, we're now confirming and essentially providing guidance that we will do north of $60 billion. And I believe that we are leaving between $10 billion and $20 billion on the table. But in the context of the budget, that we put out that internally, some $60 billion, we have the luxury of choosing the highest quality business, the right business mix, the right profile of liabilities, and the right net spread. So most of the business that was left on the table in the quarter was I call transactional. Transactional does not mean bad. It just means we elected to do other business versus transactional business. And [MIGAS] is our primarily transactional business. Anytime we want to add MIGAS, we can add MIGAS, we chose not to for the quarter given that we were already doing $19 billion of organic inflows. Look, it is clear to us that consumers prefer higher rates to lower rates. Consumers have not particularly retirees have not had good options to finance their retirement, now they do, and you're seeing it across the board in the annuity market. To think that annuities are not impacted by interest rates, it's just to ignore the obvious. What's happening to us is actually quite interesting. We are growing in a growing annuity market. But we're also in the midst of growing our distribution. Each of the last few years, we have added immense new distribution banking partners, we will add the largest or second largest provider of annuities in this country. At some point, this, I think we this quarter, and that will not mature till a year from now. And then we have two or three other very large providers coming on. So I do think the overall market share for retail will be impacted by rates if in fact rates go down. That doesn't mean negative or substantially negative, but it will have on the margin be a negative force. Having said that, our distribution is still building so quickly, that I doubt we will see any real decline in retail. More interesting to me, is also the diversity of channels. PRT is gathering speed, high rates or higher rates are really causing all plans who are close to fully funded status to consider derisking. And even those that were inequity are thinking of taking chips off the table given the very shallow rally, let's say in equities. So I expect PRT to be very, very active over the next few years, US and overseas. Japan, as I've mentioned on previous quarters is exactly where we want it to be. It's on track. And I think reinsurance is also going to be a very important part of our business. So in summary, I think we're leaving business on the table this year. And I am optimistic that notwithstanding the forward curve, we will see continued increases in business. Next year will also include the full benefit or full detriment depending on your point of, ADIP being fully ramped and taking its full share. So it's more of the business will-- more of the SRE will go to ADIP on a comparable basis in \u201824 versus \u201823. And all that is factored into Martin's guidance. Thank you. Thanks for the question. It's Marc, look, we look at this, and we and our peer group and the banking system, quite frankly, we're going to be financing energy transition movements towards sustainability for the rest of our professional careers. The scale of money required, just like nothing else we've ever seen. And so we step back, and we think about what that is, what kind of money, is it equity? Is it debt? Is it hybrid? When we look at the market, most of what we see is debt and hybrid. Our goal is to build the leading financier of energy transition sustainability worldwide. By having put together a perpetual, evergreen fund focused on doing that. In addition, we will raise bespoke drawdown equity funds from time to time. But those will be in my opinion, smaller than the opportunity that we see. We announced either last quarter or at the beginning of the year, that we had made an initial funding and initial capitalization with a few billion dollars of seed capital, that capital is getting deployed quite rapidly. A pipeline is growing. And I expect this vehicle to have the potential to be among the largest vehicles on our platform. But let's get the money invested that we have first, let's show investors that we've done a good job with it. Let's really define the types of opportunities and the return requirements. But I am equally optimistic that there's a great opportunity here but it's a debt and hybrid opportunity primarily."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Apollo Global Management's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. This call may contain forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures during this conference, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website.  Please also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.  I will now turn the conference over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks, Donna, and welcome again, everyone, to our call this morning. Earlier, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website.  First quarter results were strong and outperformed on a number of fronts, which we believe few others can say amid this backdrop of market volatility. We'll discuss further over the course of the call, but it's quite apparent that our purchase price matters approach is shining, allowing us to be very front-footed in executing our strategic objectives.  The proof is in the numbers. We reported record quarterly FRE of $397 million or $0.67 per share and normalized SRE of $811 million or $1.36 per share which together increased a remarkable 45% year-over-year. This powerful combination of fee and spread-related earnings, coupled with principal investing income, drove normalized adjusted net income of $942 or $1.58 per share in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, which is indicative of the type of consistent, compound earnings growth we believe we can deliver to our shareholders.  Joining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah, and good morning to all. Noah started down the path that I'd like to pick up on and really talk about the two different bets we have made versus our industry.  The first is an investment style bet. If you look across our $600 billion of AUM, you never have to worry about what strategy we're following. Every strategy is purchase price matters. Purchase price matters is grounded in facts, it's grounded in cash flow, it's grounded in business prospects.  In the equity business, which Scott will talk about, it manifests itself in a maniacal focus on low purchase price for the quality of business that we are buying. In the credit market, it manifests itself at being top of the capital structure senior secured and floating rate.  If I tick through just this quarter's results and how purchase price matters plays into this amid this market dislocation and volatility, in our credit business, corporate credit, up 3%; structured credit, up 3%; direct origination, up 5%. I hosted a webcast earlier this month for ADS and Earl Hunt, 98% of the book senior secured, floating rate, originated in '22 and in '23, great years in which to originate.  If I turn to our equity business. Private equity, up 5%; European nonperforming loans through EPF, up 2%. Literally, across the board against a backdrop of instability, purchase price matters has paid off. It is really hard not to chase the hot dot of momentum and liquidity, especially when it goes on for so long against a backdrop of money printing, but that, in fact, is what we did and why we are where we are today.  The second bet I'd like to talk about goes back to our Investor Day in October 2021. We told you at the time that we were going to make a different bet than almost everyone else in our industry. And if you look across our industry, some have bet on real estate equity, some have bet on infrastructure, some have bet on subordinated debt in BDCs, some have bet on growth.  None of these in and of themselves are bad strategies. And in fact, some of our competitors execute against these strategies quite well. But these are not our strategies. The bet we told you at the time that we were making, if you looked at the vast majority of our AUM growth was on fixed income replacement. Think of that as private investment grade.  We made a really big push into private IG. Difference in private credit is how not is how private credit is normally talked about, which normally means levered loans and below investment grade. We are the investment-grade version. This quarter, our yield AUM was some $440 billion. And while that sounds quite large, and it is the largest of the private credit businesses, this is against the backdrop of a $40 trillion market that we estimate that we would otherwise be looking at. We are simply not significant in the market. And this is the best news. We are large, but not significant. That's a position I like to work from.  Think about who we compete with and who we don't compete with. The press likes to frame private credit as an enemy of the banking system. In fact, if we think about our businesses and how we've positioned our private IG franchise, we want what the banks don't want and vice versa. So let me articulate that very clearly because I think it is important that it come out.  At the end of the day, we want the asset. We actually don't want the client because we are not prepared to cross-sell the client anything. We can't sell them equity, we can't sell them M&A, we can't sell them FX, derivatives, hedging, payments or credit cards. Ironically, for much of the banking system, the banking system wants the client, but not the asset, particularly in a world of market stress, where many banks, particularly regional banks are rethinking their strategy. I like where we sit in the food chain, I like what we're focused on, and I believe we are very well positioned.  In a time of market instability against a backdrop of a good entry point for credit at higher rates, the world is looking for safe yield. Insurance companies, including our own insurance company, Athene and Athora need safe yield. Competitive insurance companies need safe yield. Japanese banks need safe yield. Pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds need safe yield. Safe yield is, as I suggested, a potential replacement for fixed income, particularly publicly traded IG. Again, I like the hand we're playing and I like the bet we've made.  If I turn now to the two businesses. We told you for asset management that 2023 was going to be a year of execution and a recognition and achieving of all of the investments that we have made in prior years.  In addition, we projected that we would grow some 25% year-over-year in FRE. I believe we will meet that metric. We are well on our track to doing it. We experienced $57 billion of inflows in the quarter, and we're on track to far surpass last year's $130 billion. I would expect a record or as like says near record of asset management fundraising in Q2. I believe purchase price matters resonates now more than ever, and I expect a very strong year.  Equally interesting is capital deployment. Those who have followed closely over the past few weeks will see just how active we've been in the buyout business, a place we've had not had tremendous amounts of activity during the run-up in purchase price. Scott will walk you through the market activity. We have been equally busy in credit as this is a perfect entry point for what we do in private IG.  An important part of our growth today, and in fact, as I've said previously, a limiter of our growth is our capacity to originate assets that offer excess return per unit of risk. We do this both directly in terms of direct lending but we also do it via platforms. Think of platforms as businesses whose only business is the production of credit. Today, we have 16 platforms. Three of the largest are Midcap, Wheels and Atlas.  Just to give you a feel for how business is progressing. MidCap did $3.5 billion of originations year-to-date. Normally, MidCap would produce about a 14% ROE. For the most recent period of time, MidCap's ROE approaches 17%.  Wheels, which is our fleet lessor, has experienced no credit losses since the acquisition of Donlen. Again, wheels would normally produce about a 13% to 15% ROE. In the most recent period of time, Wheels ROE is approaching 19%.  Atlas integration well underway, I appreciate whoever wrote Atlas hugs versus Atlas shrugs. And in fact, I think the timing for the purchase of Atlas could not have been better. What is better than being a lender to other lenders during a time of market stress from a position of secured IG top of the capital structure, floating rate with wide spreads. We have a tremendous amount of work to do there, but we are very excited about what we've seen today.  In short, the origination business is better because of the market stress. We are filling in where the market now is suffering certain lapses, and we are earning higher spread. We are able to underwrite with a negative credit mindset. We are able to protect the downside, most of what we're doing is top of the capital structured floating rate and senior secured.  Let me turn a bit to our Capital Solutions business. In prior quarters, I've given you a little bit of our philosophy. We want generally in capital solutions, particularly in our debt business 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. As we have become an increasingly large originator and an increasingly diverse originator, this business is becoming a recurring business. The vast majority of this business and the growth I expect in the future will be around this philosophy of we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. We are becoming people's favorite stop to fill out what they need in terms of yield in their IG book without compromising credit during a period of market stress and concerned about the economic future.  Save the best for last, retirement services and Athene. 2022 was the best year in Athene's history, record inflows in earnings. 2023, I expect to be better and has started off even stronger. Every metric worked in Q1. Normalized spread of 160 basis points, new business priced very attractively, leading market share, very strong sidecar capital formation, which we will update you as we have further closings.  In short, inflows were $12 billion in the first quarter, roughly about the same as 2022. And I see this a little bit as the golden age of annuities. Consumers simply prefer 5% to 2%. It's not more complicated than that.  We built and have continued to build our international insurance relationships. We now have three significant reinsurance relationships in the Japanese market, and I expect that to be five before year-end. I expect that we will generate some $5 billion a year annually of flow reinsurance from this market. And I expect this year in terms of flow reinsurance to be the single best year in our history, somewhere between $9 billion and $10 billion of flow.  Pension activity and pension buyout activity with higher rates is ramping. We recently announced an $8 billion solution for a blue chip client, and I expect second quarter inflows at Athene to be north of $17 billion. In short, we're on track to exceed last year's record annual inflows of $48 billion.  For the quarter, normalized spread was $811 million. This was, as we've said internally a bit of a goldilock scenario. Spreads were wider than expected, rates were higher than expected. We kept more business in-house, meaning that we did not give as much to the sidecar. That will correct itself in the second half of the year but will result in higher earnings for the year.  Atlas was a net positive. In short, it all worked. In addition, as I'm sure Martin will walk through, conservative reserving methodology led to positive LDTI adjustments.  I think as we step back, we should not multiply $811 million by 4. But relative to the 20% growth in SRE that we had projected at year-end, I would expect us to have upside to that target. That is even holding some $12.7 billion of cash at [indiscernible]. We positioned ourselves defensively. We positioned ourselves to take advantage of widespread, and now we are taking advantage of widespread. When your book is in good shape, you are able to take advantage of opportunities offered in the marketplace.  Before I turn it over to Scott, and I'm anxious to turn it over to Scott because he has lots to say, I thought I would spend a minute on surrenders. Given the activity we've seen in the banking sector, we've received lots of questions about how this impacts or, in fact, does not impact the retirement services industry. Let me start with the punch line, this does not impact the retirement services industry. People who own annuities are saving for retirement. This is not money they think is accessible. When they do surrender or move it, they're typically moving to another policy. Otherwise, they incur tax burden and tax efficiency.  Finally, from our point of view, we run our book and we invest against long-term locked-in liabilities. 80% of our portfolio is nonsurrenderable or is protected by market value adjustments and surrender charges. This is not the first time we've confronted these issues. We've been doing this for a long time.  In the materials that we put out this morning, I asked the team to put out a table that really goes through the four different types of outflows that we experienced in terms of our book. The first, and I'm referring to a table that is in the materials, the first is what we call maturity driven or contractual outflows. This is exactly what you -- what it sounds like.  We enter into an FABN, it has a maturity. We originate a MIGA, it has a maturity. Those numbers are fully predictable, and you will see them from quarter-over-quarter. And I know when Athene does its deep dive call, you will see not just what has happened, but you will see Athene's projection for the next few quarters.  The next few categories, what I'll call, policy-driven outflows or policyholder driven outflows, the largest of which is income-oriented withdrawals. Recall that for retirees, when they get to a certain age, they are required to take minimum amounts out of their policies. Those minimum amounts of their policies are, in fact, what come out on a planned and on a budgeted basis. We then are left with two other types of withdrawals, from those out of surrender charge where we would expect to see more withdrawals, and for those in surrender charge where we would expect to see very few withdrawals. In fact, that is what we are experiencing.  If I look at the weeks surrounding Silicon Valley Bank and the run on Silicon Valley Bank, I compare call center volume, surrender activity or any other form of activity, simply no change. This business continues to be very, very predictable. We are matched in terms of duration, we are matched in terms of interest rates. And it gives us the confidence to invest against these liabilities and earn spread, which we then lock in for long periods of time.  In short, 2023 for us is a year of execution and one where I believe both the strategy of focusing on fixed income replacement and the investment dynamic of purchase price matters will pay off.  For us, there is so much upside for executing the base business plan but the simple shorthand for what we intend to do in 2023 is no new toys. The bar is extremely high to do something new given the opportunity in front of us. The three original growth drivers origination, capital solutions and global wealth are well on track. Scott will detail the next 6. We're driving toward operating leverage this year. It is a key point of our focus. It occupies a lot of our mind share. We achieved a little of it this quarter, but there's more to come.  Today, we end the year or we end the quarter at $600 billion of AUM, $500 billion of that in yield and hybrid. Team is in great shape, momentum is good.  And with that, I'd like to pass it to Scott.\nScott Kleinman: Thanks, Marc. This is certainly an exciting time to be in our business. As you can see from our results, purchase price matters is succeeding in this environment as demonstrated by strong investment performance in several strategies including flagship private equity, direct origination and opportunistic credit portfolios. We believe we're one of the few firms who can play offense in these periods of uncertainty, which was quite clear by the level of deployment activity in the first quarter. We signed four private equity deals since our last earnings call, and our current pipeline of opportunities is about 3x a year ago and growing. We announced the first acquisition from our latest flagship fund just last fall. And since then, Fund X has invested or committed approximately $6 billion of capital.  The strength of our relationships and ability to structure complex financing solutions are really what set us apart when traditional funding sources are limited. For example, in the wake of market turmoil surrounding bank failures in March, we announced an $8 billion acquisition of chemical company Univar Solutions, an industry vertical in which we have long-standing expertise. And just last week, we announced the $5 billion acquisition of aluminum products manufacturer Arconic by our private equity funds.  Our hybrid business is also thriving in this backdrop of higher rates, earnings pressure and lack of appetite for bank-led syndicated credit. With corporates focused on deleveraging in the face of upcoming debt maturities and sponsors seeking exit alternatives amid tepid IPO markets, we're seeing increased demand for private market solutions via structured equity and credit. Accordingly, our investment pipeline for hybrid value is robust and we expect the deployment environment to remain attractive for quite some time.  With the dislocation we've seen in the banking sector over the past couple of months, we've been leaning into a wide range of investing opportunities across private credit platforms. We believe the breadth of our platform and the depth of our expertise puts us in a unique position to provide creative, flexible capital solutions to a range of borrowers, especially to those that may not be as widely serviced by traditional lenders.  We're able to generate a low double-digit yield for first lien debt backed by good collateral. As a recent example, we agreed to invest EUR 1 billion in a portfolio of high-quality assets controlled by Vonovia, a leading global residential real estate company, which provided a long-term cost-effective solution for the company.  Inclusive of this investment, we've originated over $18 billion of high-grade alpha transactions since the start of 2022. The pipeline of these types of high-quality attractive investments is already significant today. And longer term, we think the opportunity to gain market share is even greater and spans an even wider range of asset classes from corporate lending to all sorts of asset-backed finance.  As it relates to fundraising trends, the long-term secular tailwinds driving growth in allocations to private markets remain intact, and momentum across our platform is strong. While recent market disruption has caused some observable shifts in market behavior, particularly with U.S. and European institutional investors. Investors based in the Middle East and Asia actually turned up their focus and seem to have viewed it as an opportune time to allocate capital. Individual investors were also quite level-headed and we saw no material increase in redemptions from global wealth offerings and a steady build in new capital in the first quarter.  On the product level, fundraising trends in traditional private equity are still facing some headwinds, but with a total of approximately 30 commingled and perpetual capital vehicles expected to be in market this year. We still feel confident in our ability to raise more capital than we did in 2022. We expect second quarter inflows to be particularly robust given the line of sight we have to several sizable mandates and fund closes in the near-term pipeline as Marc mentioned.  On Fund X specifically, we've received total commitments of approximately $16 billion through the end of March. Throughout the marketing process, we've experienced solid demand from repeat investors off the back of very strong Fund IX performance, which appreciated 23% in 2022 and 8% in the first quarter.  Looking forward, we have a great queue of investors in the final stages of documentation and currently expect total commitments to be in the low $20 billion range with a final close expected over summer. The amount of capital positions us with one of the largest funds in the industry and with the flexibility to lean into a range of interesting opportunities in today's markets.  We're also making meaningful progress on the six additional growth initiatives we highlighted in February. These six areas: AAA, Athene Altitude, third-party insurance, sidecars, clean transition and sponsor and secondary solutions position us to take -- tackle huge white space opportunities. These initiatives are natural extensions of our three key growth pillars and therefore, play to our strengths including complex product structuring, proprietary asset origination and, of course, generating excess return per unit of risk. As these businesses scale over the next few years, we expect our third-party fundraising will grow in size, diversity and consistency.  Here are some highlights. For AAA, an innovative core equity replacement vehicle, we're continuing to broaden distribution to both institutional and global wealth clients. In addition to the 40-plus approvals in place with independent distributors, we have a handful of new wirehouse and bank relationships geared to come online in the coming months, and conversations with family offices are also ramping up.  Just last week, we announced the launch of a Luxembourg-based product platform that provides individual investors in Europe, Asia and Latin America, access to two investment strategies, including AAA in their local currency with lower investment minimums than traditional alternative product offerings. The proposition of equity-like returns with downside protection is proving especially attractive in this highly volatile public market backdrop, and we remain very bullish on the long-term outlook for this fund.  For Athene Altitude, an innovative tax-deferred annuity wrap product, we've received positive initial feedback from several retail distribution partners. We have a few firms in late stages of due diligence and expect to launch the product more broadly in the coming months.  Within clean transition, we recently announced the launch of Apollo Clean Transition Capital or ACT Capital, with $4 billion to deploy into yield and hybrid investments in support of corporate transition to clean energy.  Meaningful seed investment from a strategic partner and our aligned pools of capital should enable us to build a diversified portfolio and investment track record from which we can eventually raise additional third-party capital. We also expect to launch the Apollo Clean Transition private equity strategy in the third quarter, which will continue to expand the scope and scale of our activity in the sustainable investing area.  And lastly, we began raising third-party capital for our inaugural equity secondaries vehicle in the second quarter, which is part of our sponsor and secondary solutions, or S3 business. As a reminder, we began investing for this strategy last fall with a chunk of seed capital from long-term strategic -- from a long-term strategic partner and AAA to help anchor the broader fundraise. Deployment activity has been strong since then, and the vehicle has committed over $1 billion of capital in transactions led by S3.  Combined with our three strategic growth pillars, these next six initiatives provide significant runway for growth. We look forward to providing updates as these exciting initiatives develop.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financial results in more detail.\nMartin Kelly: Great. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So our asset management and retirement services businesses clearly continue to create recurring and growing income streams that demonstrate stability through significant market disruptions like we saw in the first quarter.  Almost 60% of our assets under management is comprised of perpetual capital, with the remaining concentrated in long-term locked-up structures. And the funding source for our retirement services businesses, as Marc highlighted, is highly persistent with predictable long-term liabilities.  In , this creates a very resilient earnings profile particularly when considering pressures on the broader financial sector. Within our asset management Business, first quarter FRE increased by 28% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both management fees and capital solutions fees. These increases reflect the approximate of asset management inflows over the last 12 months as well as the broadening of our capital solutions capabilities as several of the substantial growth investments we've made over the past couple of years are translating into top line revenue.  Fee-generating inflows in the first quarter included $20 billion related to an investment management agreement with Atlas, for which we'll earn a 10 basis point fee. Fee-related expenses grew by 20% -- 26% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. After several years of investment in our platform, the pace of headcount growth and the rate of increase in noncompensation costs will decelerate materially in 2023, making 2022 an inflection point for FRE cost growth. Altogether, as Marc suggested, we expect to deliver some operating leverage this year while targeting 25% FRE growth.  Moving to retirement services. Athene's performance to begin the year was stellar and exceeded our expectations. Part of the outperformance reflects a more favorable investing environment while part reflects more episodic gains or timing benefits. We reported normalized net spread of approximately 160 basis points in the first quarter, the highest level the business has seen in a decade. In the first part of the year, the investing environment was very attractive and we're able to deploy incoming flows at higher on the margin yields than we anticipated.  The weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases exceeded the BBB corporate bond index by more than 150 basis points in the first quarter versus only approximately 25 basis points in all of 2022. The higher rate environment also drove net spread accretion from Athene's floating rate position and cash holdings.  Episodic or timing benefits in the quarter included fees related to financing arrangements for the Atlas transaction and some elevated fees related to certain fixed rate loans, SRE benefits in advance of the second vintage of strategic third-party sidecar capital, assuming its proportionate share of inflows from the first half of 2023 early in Q3, and we continue to expect sidecar capital to support approximately 40% of total Athene inflows this year in aggregate.  And then lastly, we expect an approximate $3 billion outflow in the third quarter related to the recapture of some older annuity liabilities by one of our affiliated partners. This will free up capital for Athene to redeploy in attractive investing environment while providing portfolio diversification for our affiliated partner, similar to the Catalina transaction in the fourth quarter of last year.  Due to the new insurance accounting standard commonly referred to as LDTI, last week, Athene recast SRE results for 2022. These new requirements drove a favorable impact to normalized SRE of $220 million in 2022, which was entirely reflected within cost of funds and translates to 12 basis points of normalized net spread benefit. We expect this benefit to persist in 2023 and the years beyond, although at an approximate 10 basis point in normalized spread terms. This effectively increases our normalized net spread target for 2023 from 135 to 140 basis points, up by 10 basis points to 145 to 150.  In addition, there are a few other moving pieces that should impact the outlook for SRE this year. First, given the deployment opportunities we're seeing in the market today, we do expect to put new money to work at better yields than we had originally forecast. And then -- but on the other hand, as Marc described, we prudently increased Athene's cash balance this quarter to provide an extra layer of stability amid heightened market volatility in March.  Normalizing for the benefit of LDTI, considering an improved deployment backlog with offsets from higher cash balances, we expect normalized SRE to slightly exceed $3 billion this year, with an estimated normalized net spread range of 150 to 155 basis points.  Let me spend a moment on capital allocation. We expect our free cash flow to be utilized to fund the base dividend, return incremental capital to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks and dividend increases and to invest in strategic growth. In any given quarter or year, we determine how to best allocate capital based on its highest returning use.  We use the following framework in making this determination. For the dividend, we aim to generate a yield in line with or better than the S&P 500, which is currently yielding approximately 2% today versus 2.8%. For opportunistic share repurchases, we target at least a high teens IRR over the medium term and that's signaling closer to 20% at current trading multiples. For strategic growth investments, we underwrite a target return equal to or better than opportunistic share repurchases with the potential for strategic upside benefits.  And all of these HoldCo capital users are weighed against growing Athene. Even without using any third-party sidecar capital from ADIP growing Athene is very compelling as it's generating an estimated low 20% pretax ROE today. This return profile is further enhanced with increasing utilization of ADIP.  In the first quarter specifically, we deployed $160 million of capital for opportunistic share repurchases, and our current orientation is to spend less on strategic investments given the large number of organic growth initiatives under development and the high bar in which we are using to consider these new opportunities. As we communicated last quarter, we expect to be a buyer of our stock on a more consistent basis as we move through our 5-year plan.  In conclusion, our financial results in the first quarter positioned us very well to execute on our strategic and financial goals for the year. We're busier than ever, we're highly focused on the significant opportunity in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: So Marc, maybe we could start with the current environment. Apollo clearly built a really broad set of origination capabilities. We talked about that a bunch in the past, but the dislocation in the regional bank space is amplifying and amplifying really the supply-demand imbalance against that we see in the market.  So given that backdrop, maybe spend a minute on areas you expect to be more active in among the existing platforms. Are there any new asset classes in a way that you could further lean into? And then maybe talk a little bit about third-party fundraising that could get accelerated by what's going on in the credit space, call it, over the next 12 months.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. We are, as you know, broadly focused on scaling our private credit business. Our private credit business is different than most other private credit businesses in that the majority, and the vast majority of it is fixed income replacement or private investment grade. This fits very well with the space that is currently in retrenchment by the banking system because the banking system historically was not a risk taker. They were an accommodation, top of the capital structure senior secured. We, in fact, are top of the capital structure, senior secured and floating rate.  If I step back, de-banking has already been happening across our country. Following Dodd-Frank, which essentially encouraged the development of bank replacement by investors, banks, we estimate are less than 20% of all debt capital in U.S. capital markets. Given what's happened in regional banking, I expect that to become more of an investor marketplace.  The way the U.S. banks today in the investment marketplace is indirectly through securitization. If you look at growth in CLO, growth in ABS, growth in other forms of securitization, you're seeing essentially how America banks today. Atlas, the Credit Suisse Securitized Products group, along with Redding Ridge, along with MidCap, along with the Wheels, Donlen and the other platforms we have built are all focused on this marketplace.  I would expect, Alex, that you will see a tremendous tick up in securitized product relative to traditional direct lending, and it's a space that I believe has a lot of white space and where we are incredibly well positioned. And I would expect in later quarters that we will see fundraising develop around this. Investors, particularly those who have essentially invested in the first round of private credit are meaningfully underexposed to structured product and don't have great ways to have access to it. So I think this is actually a really interesting time for the platform and one in which we're well positioned.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous.\nPatrick Davitt: On that point, do you have any kind of updated thoughts on how much annual origination capacity you think will come online with Atlas? And through that lens, as we look to your doing -- third-party insurance business, is there any risk that it will be harder for you to build that part of the business out as insurance companies might see Athene as too big a competitor?\nMarc Rowan: So Atlas -- it's hard to say on Atlas. Atlas had been a $70 billion book of business that I view as turning annually or every 1.5 years. At the time of acquisition, we purchased roughly a $40 billion book of business. And so I would expect you should see somewhere $30 billion, $40 billion of annual originations.  We had, prior to Atlas had originations running at close to $100 billion. As you know, our 5-year target is $150 billion of annual originations, and I believe certainly with Atlas, but also with the growth of the platform and what's happening with banking generally, I would expect that we would exceed that $150 billion of annual originations well before the date that we had projected.  With respect to the competitive nature of our business, we really do honor this 25% of everything and 100% of nothing philosophy. Some of the people you would perceive as Athene's largest competitors are actually our partners in these origination platforms. Not only do we not want 100% of any transaction, we actually are prepared to share the means of origination with people who you would have sensibly view as our competitors.  If I step back and again, think about our business, more than $500 billion of our $600 billion of AUM is partner capital where we're essentially working with the marketplace. Yes, private equity and transaction-based businesses are somewhat zero-sum, someone wins and someone loses. But for the vast majority of business, if you are our competitor, either an asset management or insurance, and you want to build, for instance, a CLO business in competition with Apollo CLO business, not only we will give you equity, we'll give you warehouse. We'll warehouse collateral for you. We'll buy your liabilities and we'll put you in business. If you want to start a broker-dealer in competition with our capital solutions business, we'll fund your broker-dealer. We are simply not in competition with any one company.  We are in a market where we are $440 billion of AUM, which sounds really large, but I assure you that the CEOs of the four big banks in the U.S. do not wake up every day wondering what the mighty Apollo is doing. We are fortunate to be really large, but at the same time, in a vast sea where we are not yet a relevant player.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: So I'm curious, you're in the business of capturing spread, obviously, but I'm curious if you think you benefited as much as you thought you'd benefit from this big move up in rates? And the flip side of that is, how are you thinking about what to do with the portfolios and your investment in your deployment as the forward curve is now expecting some rate cuts along the way? Just curious on how you're pivoting as we might be pivoting on the rate cut side.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. Thanks, Glenn, it's Marc. So first, rates in and of themselves do not fundamentally alter the shape of the business. They alter the attractiveness of the product, as I've said, because consumers prefer higher rates to lower rates. But in terms of our business model, our cost of funds pretty much adjusts with the opportunities available in the marketplace, absent unusual events like in the first quarter, where we earned excess spread. So rate moves don't really affect spread in and of themselves.  We have had the luxury because we earned adequate spread on prior books of business of holding a large floating rate position. And I'll come back to this because it's important to know that. The floating rate position did exactly what it was supposed to do. It provided excess earnings during a period of low rates moving to higher rates. You should assume that we have maintained, but normalized, the floating rate position at Athene, reflecting the current market environment.  The important thing, I think, and you didn't ask the question, but I think it's important to understand our business. When we were building Athene, we built scale inorganically by buying books of business. When rates are low, buying blocks of business is actually just fine because the business that's on the books is generally has high guarantees in a low rate environment. When you buy a block of business, it's generally outside or near the end of its surrender charge and market value adjustment period. And so you take a big risk doing inorganic deals, unless there's a huge differential between the rate environment and the guarantee and the policy. We were -- spreads were so wide when we were building that business that we could actually afford to hedge that risk through floating rate.  What's happening today, we haven't done an inorganic deal in about 3 years. The cost of inorganic deals, given the competition in the marketplace exceeds meaningfully the cost of funds with newly issued, newly protected surrender charges and market value adjustments. What we are seeing today is the last desperate attempt of people in our industry trying to build scale. Think about what's happening, all the concerns that investors have about surrenders and policyholder behavior, someone who buys a block of business today, is buying generally old surrender charges, old market value adjustments that are burning off, and they're buying into a rate environment that is high where consumers have alternatives. So you would not expect to be able to hedge that block in a meaningful way.  So I view this as kind of the interesting thing in our industry. I think it's going to be very hard to get to scale in this rate environment, absent a meaningful organic origination engine because you simply do not want to invest or put capital behind policies that are not protected by surrender charges, market value adjustments or other contractual or economic incentives.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rufus Hone of BMO Capital Markets.\nRufus Hone: I was hoping you could spend a moment on the ramp of AAA and maybe give us your thoughts on what you think the run rate inflows could be for that product around year-end. And was also curious on Athene Altitude and the potential there for tax advantage products. Specifically, I suppose, what products can you house within one of these VA wrappers and what limitations are there? Because seems to me like a no-brainer to defer your taxes, if it's possible.\nScott Kleinman: Sure. I'll start with the AAA question. So as I mentioned in my comments, we are really starting to hit the sweet spot of adding distribution partners to the AAA offering. To your question of where this could be on a retail basis, we could be approaching $0.5 billion to $1 billion a quarter, I think, by the end of the year. Retail plus one of the surprises we found is that this is more attractive to certain institutional investors than we would have expected when we created the product and that, of course, is a little bit lumpier, but we're starting to see real progress on that.  So in due course, we've said in the past, this could very well be Apollo's largest product. And I do really believe that over the next few years, this could be a product, $20 billion, $30-plus billion.\nMarc Rowan: Maybe I'll hit Athene Altitude. So we've articulated previously, and I certainly have been quoted publicly stating that over the next 5 years, I expect that high net worth investors will be better than 50% allocated to alternatives. That always elicits certainly a look because it is not where the people are today. But I start with a definition of an alternative.  To us, as an alternative is nothing other than an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. And I believe alternatives go from AA to equity. So when I say 50% allocated to alternatives, I do not believe they will be allocated to private equity or venture capital or risk but to alternatives in the newer definition that I've suggested.  Today, you can buy from Apollo investment-grade only yield. You can buy total return, you can buy opportunistic credit, you can buy REIT, you can buy BDC, you can buy our credit strategies head fund and you can buy AAA, all wrapped in an Altitude annuity for an excess cost of 30 basis points with no further restrictions.  We, as an industry, are in the early stages of addressing the needs of high net worth and retail investors versus institutions. One of the key differences is institutions are not taxpayers. They generally are pension funds or endowments or other types of tax exempts. So our industry has not historically been as tax sensitive. So if you think of the experience of a BDC investor in a high-tax state, an 8% dividend yield looks like 3.8% to the consumer. That's not as attractive as .  But we are in an education phase and the whole growth of alternatives is about education. And retail investors and their financial advisers first need to understand the products. And they are getting an education in products, and we are doing our part and other firms in the industry are responsibly doing their part. This next layer of Altitude and wrapping is yet another bit of education. So we are selling this product today mostly to high net worth individuals and family offices, and this product will get increased amounts of traction as Martin or Scott in their remarks suggested.  I believe we will have our first broad distribution of this at some point this year. And you should expect us, as new products come online, we will continue to build out the family of products under the Altitude brand.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Just a question on the retirement services business. You mentioned an increase in cash balances, adding an extra layer of stability. How meaningful is that? And what do you see in the marketplace? And when you look at your outflow profile that's leading you to do that, we saw an 11% outflow rate in the quarter. So I guess a question there, how do you expect that to trend over the next couple of years and you mentioned a recapture of some older annuities coming up in the third quarter? What's the expectation to see more of those following Catalina that we saw last year?\nMarc Rowan: So it's Marc. On a normalized basis, we hold about 12 -- excuse me, $6 billion, $6.5 billion of cash. So this is about $6 billion of extra cash. For those of you I've seen in person or have attended a call with, I remember in the early days of the banking crisis, calling out to Jim Belardi and asking him to give me the benefit of some leeway. I was going to ask him to do something that had no justification other than feel, which was to massively increase our cash balances at the point of instability we were watching Credit Suisse and Signature and SVB. And Jim did that. And ironically, it's positioned him to take advantage of wider spread. So in hindsight, I think it's been no harm no foul, and I would expect to see cash balances come down.  The question on outflows, I hope we answered better in terms of the table that we disclosed, but I'll come back to you and I'll speak philosophically first. When we construct a product, we put a lot of benefits into the product. We strip away the excess features that give rise to volatility that consumers really don't know how to value anyway and we put it into the price. And yet we create a very low cost of funds, and we've gone from a start-up to the largest provider and the largest market share in the U.S. market. That is no mean feat. But when a product comes out of surrender charge or its market value adjustment burns off, we take the product to its contractual minimum. We want the product to surrender because we cannot invest and earn spread against a product that is redeemable at any point in time.  This is true across the industry. It is not just us who follows this as a point in time. And recall, policies generally do not leave the industry, they recycle because otherwise, people suffer tax consequences, and this is a retirement product. This is not a demand deposit.  What's happening to us, and we are seeing the benefit of is we were a zero market share, and now we're the largest market share. We are the benefit of this recycling at a point in time in the industry. when rates are higher, and therefore, consumers are more interested in annuities. And the whole industry is up. We're just up more than about anyone else.  So I come back to the specifics now in how surrenders work. The maturity cycle of contractual-based outflows will go up and down based on the business that we see 3, 5, 7 years ago. We can tell you pretty much quarter-by-quarter, and Athene will do that in their deep dive, what's the contractual maturity driven outcomes will be. In some quarters, it will be up, some quarters it will be down. You can actually look back to this quarter, that maturity driven was 3%. Q3 in 2022, it was 5.7%. You should expect to see a lot of volatility in that line based on business done 3, 5 and 7 years ago.  Income with policyholder driven outflows, the three categories, for income-oriented withdrawals, you should see this as a steady amount of money that goes out based on the age of policyholder and their proclivity or need or legal requirement to take income. This is also planned.  The next line is from policies out of surrender charge. This is also planned. This gets to the point I just made. We take contractual minimums on policies that burn off their surrender charges to as low as we possibly can. We want these people to surrender. This is a relatively small amount because the vast majority of policyholders surrender at maturity. 10% approximately of the people forget they have a policy and some point in the future, they wake up and discover they have a policy that's out of surrender charge. And so this number, you can see bumps around back and forth. It's neither high or low. It's a relatively small number.  The thing that we watch pretty closely because it is the basis of our business, we look at policies and surrender charges. These are, to some extent, unplanned. These are what I would call life issues. This is health issues, death, divorce or other change in life circumstances, we generally don't see changes in these kinds of surrenders as a result of interest rates or financial markets activity. And if you go back and you look in time, this quarter, unexceptional. And you should expect and we budget that number to be kind of unexceptional on a go-forward basis.  So again, I step back and I look at this industry, and it's not the first time we've done this. This industry has been resilient over a really long period of time. You go back to the financial crisis and you think about how central AIG was to the -- in the financial crisis in 2008, really no move. If you think about Genworth, who also had its troubles in the financial crisis, also no move. Don't see anything really going on here that changes the way I think about the business. And I think we will do the best job we possibly can to give you a prediction of outflows. And the primary thing that varies is maturity driven contractual-based outflows quarter-by-quarter.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Brown of KBW.\nMichael Brown: So Marc, capital solutions has been running north of $120 million or so for the last 3 quarters. It seems like it's playing a more important role in the broader business here. Could you just explain a little bit more about what's driving on that growth here in this still very challenging backdrop? And is there potential to actually hit your $500 million target before 2026? It seems like you're certainly trending that way.\nScott Kleinman: Yes, I'll answer that. The -- look, it's exactly what we broadcast over the last year, year plus. As we've continued to scale that ACS business, right, it's about inputs and outputs. We've continued to grow the number of origination platforms, the number of products flowing into that, combined with, as we've scaled the ACS business and the number of syndicators we have, we touch more clients, more market participants. And so it's not surprising, we're seeing the steady progression.  As Marc alluded to, particularly on the credit side, we really do want to own 100% of nothing. And so by definition, that continues to feed our ACS platform. So directionally, this is heading exactly the way we would have predicted. To your point about hitting that target early, it's certainly possible that I think that 5-year plan was a little bit conservative.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I wanted to better understand the quarterly valuation process for the equity stakes of your credit origination vehicles that are held in AAA, and then for the AAA stakes that's held in the aux bucket of Athene. And my question really is it's driven by the fact that Athene no longer holds the equity stakes directly because it was swapped for AAA a couple of quarters ago.\nMarc Rowan: So I'll do a start, and then I'll turn it over to Martin. It's Marc. So the valuation process, whether it was on Athene's balance sheet or in AAA hasn't changed and makes no difference. The vast majority of the origination vehicles are held or valued on a basis of book value and ROE. And as you would imagine, in this environment, they are on the margin moving up. But there's not a tremendous amount of volatility because these are, for the most part, book value-based entities that track how they're doing in ROEs, and ROEs have been very stable over a long period of time. And Martin...\nMartin Kelly: I would just add, the only difference between the valuation in the alternatives portfolio, which was 6% for the quarter and what AAA shows is just due to certain positions that are not in AAA. But they can't be for various reasons. But otherwise...\nMarc Rowan: I think of -- just here, I think Athora or Catalina, other insurance companies can't be for regulatory and other reasons in AAA. And those positions are held out. Otherwise, 100% of the alternatives portfolio is, in fact, in AAA.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So there's no difference in any way between the valuation methods. And then within the alts portfolio for the quarter, connecting back to the comments Marc made on the platforms, the platform has generated close to 10% return within that 6% for the quarter. So the origination business is healthy and high ROEs are translating into upward markets in that portfolio.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Marc, if I can come back to a response you had to a question earlier on growth in securitized product and maybe just to compare it with direct lending. To the extent, obviously, if we get a substantial pullback over the medium and long term from the banking system, especially regional banks, can you talk about that opportunity in direct lending, but then obviously, contrasted with your sort of optimism on securitized product? And is that going to sort of take some of the share from direct lending? Or do you see them both growing pretty substantially and your participation, obviously, in both?\nMarc Rowan: Look, I'll start at the top of the ecosystem. I'll invite Scott to add as we go. So I start at the top of the ecosystem, the U.S. economy needs credit, consumers and businesses as a result of GDP and GDP growth. How that credit is provided has been in a secular change, particularly since Dodd-Frank, with more of that credit coming from the -- from investors who are the new banks versus from the banking system, government guarantee, government-backed deposit insured banks. So as a general matter, investors are supplying more credit relative to the banking system. Then we have this growth of something we call private credit, but those are two words that don't really mean anything. They just sound like they mean something because private credit can be AA or private credit can be highly risky CCC. For the most part, popular press has taken private credit to mean levered lending, which is below investment grade, which is a relatively small part of the private credit ecosystem.  Yet when investors talk about private credit and their allocation to private credit, and they sometimes use the term direct lending, almost all of that is focused on the below investment grade levered lending or direct lending. And people also think about lending in corporate format because that is the most familiar, the most common way people think about it.  For our ecosystem, we love the direct lending, below investment-grade levered lending business sometimes. Right now, we happen to love it. There's not a lot of providers. Funds are still needed. We can make commitments underwriting in a negative mindset, we can earn wide spreads, and there's a shortage of capital so we have good deal selection. Now is a good entry point to below investment grade, levered lending, private credit, direct lending, however you define it.  The point I was making is when you look at the macro of how the country is now banking in the investor marketplace, it doesn't bank primarily by selling loans in direct form to investors. It banks indirectly through securitization. When you look at the growth in ABS, when you look at the growth in other forms of structured product, that is now how America banks. And if you go to our website and you actually look at performance, not just put out by us, by put out by others, you would see that a fair read of all of the information available is that if you look at an investment-grade corporate bond today versus an investment-grade securitized product, you would conclude that at the same ratings point, the investment-grade securitized product is a better credit, which just makes sense.  Because what we've seen in the economy taking place is a significant pickup in the pace of technological change, consumer change, societal change, cultural change. And therefore, we've had more single points of failure in single investment-grade corporate issues, think SVB, think Credit Suisse, versus what securitization gives you, which is the benefit of diversification, which now has more value than ever. And it's not just Apollo saying this. This is almost everyone who has looked at the topic in an academic sense.  So investors are, for the most part, exposed to private credit and directly lending and corporate format in below investment grade. They are at the early stages of fixed income replacement of taking their IG portfolio and rotating it into something that offers them at the same ratings point, 200 to 300 basis points more. Insurance companies, others have been doing this for a really long time. And I believe that investors will also enter this market in a big way. And therefore, I think there's a lot of running room in the securitized marketplace. But once again, make a distinction between investment grade, which is a vast -- a large market and below investment grade, which is an opportunistic still really interesting market, sometimes.\nScott Kleinman: Yes. I would just add, as you look back and think about the evolution of the direct lending or private credit market over the last decade, that's really been a single name issuer level, mostly at the sub-investment grade, as we've certainly been doing over the last several years at the IG replacement level.  We look at the asset-backed opportunity and see similar type of evolution over the next 5 to 10 years. It's certainly what we've been doing with our own balance sheet for the last many years. That's been a key driver of the excess spread that we've been able to deliver. But ultimately, we think the rest of the market is waking up to this and will be a -- just a huge massive market opportunity. The difference being, you really do need the specialized origination, the specialized underwriting to really be able to be in that market, and that's just a huge benefit that we have that we've built -- we've worked so hard to build over the last 5, 7, 10 years.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Finian O'Shea of Wells Fargo.\nFinian O'Shea: Higher-level question on private investment grade. As you produce alpha there and now share that benefit between the asset manager, the annuity policyholder and outside owners of origination, for example, in AAA, do you see attention on claims to that excess return? And is there enough to go around in a more normal market environment?\nMarc Rowan: So it's Marc. The short answer is no. But I have said previously the capacity to produce excess spread or more broadly, excess return per unit of risk is the limiter of growth in our business.  In alternatives, if we are true to what we're doing, we only exist to provide this excess return per unit of risk. Otherwise, investors should be public and shouldn't leave with any liquidity restrictions. So it is our job to grow it and not try to grow our AUM any faster than we have excess spread per unit of risk.  So far, we have been good at balancing that. But we look at this all the time. This is ultimately the cap if you will, on an intelligent way to grow a long-term alternatives franchise that meets investors' needs.\nScott Kleinman: To address, so the three categories you highlighted, right, the underlying annuity holder gets the underlying rate plus some amount of excess that allows Athene's products to be attractive. Athene captures the excess spread inherent in our origination machine to be able to do that and AAA captures the return on the platform for being a creator of this attractive product. So it's actually quite a pretty logical split as to how that waterfall works.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ben Budish of Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I wanted to ask about the private equity franchise. I know you indicated that you expect to close Fund X this summer. And looking at the last several funds, you probably won't be back in the market for some time. But just a high-level question on how you think about scaling in that business. What are some sort of natural limit to a private equity drawdown fund? And then again, understanding that the scaling in your business is -- and in a couple of other places, but just curious about how we should think about the kind of forward trajectory in terms of the next several funds in that business.\nScott Kleinman: Yes, sure. So in our core private equity business, we think we're operating at the right size. A $20 billion to $25 billion footprint gives us all the capacity we need to execute on the type of transactions that we think are most attractive. A, it's among -- it puts us among the largest pools of capital out there in the private equity business. And certainly, the types of opportunistic public to privates, the scale, stressed or distressed opportunities should they arise, that's the right size of capital, meaningfully larger and perhaps it's possible. But right now, our capacity is sized -- our execution capacity is sized to that level. And certainly, the corporate environment, that really does feel like the right size. As we think about scaling, right, it obviously will come from other ancillary and related businesses. So whether it's our S3 business, our infrastructure business, our hybrid value business, just to name a few, these are platforms that are still in the maturing phases of their scale and footprint. And we do ultimately see those reaching the next stages in the coming years. But for core private equity, we think we're sitting at that sweet spot in the $20 billion size platform.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Adam Beatty of UBS.\nAdam Beatty: I wanted to ask about the pension group annuities channel for Athene. It sounds like you've got a healthy pipeline coming up there. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the impact of higher rates and maybe economic uncertainty on the level of demand and activity there? And then just how you view the attractiveness of that channel relative to other to opportunities?\nMarc Rowan: So it's Marc. So with higher rates for the most part, corporates who are the primary people who execute pension group annuity transactions, find this more attractive because they simply have to contribute less to close a gap if there is a gap in the underlying. Now I wish the equation were just that simple. But of course, it depends how they were positioned. Because if they were positioned in long-duration bonds and rates go up, their gap gets wider. If they were positioned in equities and equities sell off, their gap gets wider.  But for the most part, corporations considering pension group annuities, have been guiding towards a strategy that gets them to a more market neutral place, think shorter duration fixed income, less esoteric in the equity business. And so the benefit of higher rates is for this business overall a net positive.  This is a trust business that comes from having lots of capital, by having an institutional capability to pass independent fiduciaries and by having the know-how to do and onboard 100,000 clients at a time. There is a handful of companies in our industry who have met all those requirements. It is a competitive but less competitive market than the origination business, which itself is significantly less competitive than the inorganic buying of blocks business, which I've already given you my comments on, which I think is in its final throes.  So I -- for one, I'm excited about pension group annuities. I think the team at Athene is second to none and the pipeline is as it should be.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now return the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing comments.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks for your help this morning, Donna, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. If you have any questions or feedback on our call today, feel free to reach out to us directly, and we look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Scott Kleinman",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc. This is certainly an exciting time to be in our business. As you can see from our results, purchase price matters is succeeding in this environment as demonstrated by strong investment performance in several strategies including flagship private equity, direct origination and opportunistic credit portfolios. We believe we're one of the few firms who can play offense in these periods of uncertainty, which was quite clear by the level of deployment activity in the first quarter. We signed four private equity deals since our last earnings call, and our current pipeline of opportunities is about 3x a year ago and growing. We announced the first acquisition from our latest flagship fund just last fall. And since then, Fund X has invested or committed approximately $6 billion of capital.  The strength of our relationships and ability to structure complex financing solutions are really what set us apart when traditional funding sources are limited. For example, in the wake of market turmoil surrounding bank failures in March, we announced an $8 billion acquisition of chemical company Univar Solutions, an industry vertical in which we have long-standing expertise. And just last week, we announced the $5 billion acquisition of aluminum products manufacturer Arconic by our private equity funds.  Our hybrid business is also thriving in this backdrop of higher rates, earnings pressure and lack of appetite for bank-led syndicated credit. With corporates focused on deleveraging in the face of upcoming debt maturities and sponsors seeking exit alternatives amid tepid IPO markets, we're seeing increased demand for private market solutions via structured equity and credit. Accordingly, our investment pipeline for hybrid value is robust and we expect the deployment environment to remain attractive for quite some time.  With the dislocation we've seen in the banking sector over the past couple of months, we've been leaning into a wide range of investing opportunities across private credit platforms. We believe the breadth of our platform and the depth of our expertise puts us in a unique position to provide creative, flexible capital solutions to a range of borrowers, especially to those that may not be as widely serviced by traditional lenders.  We're able to generate a low double-digit yield for first lien debt backed by good collateral. As a recent example, we agreed to invest EUR 1 billion in a portfolio of high-quality assets controlled by Vonovia, a leading global residential real estate company, which provided a long-term cost-effective solution for the company.  Inclusive of this investment, we've originated over $18 billion of high-grade alpha transactions since the start of 2022. The pipeline of these types of high-quality attractive investments is already significant today. And longer term, we think the opportunity to gain market share is even greater and spans an even wider range of asset classes from corporate lending to all sorts of asset-backed finance.  As it relates to fundraising trends, the long-term secular tailwinds driving growth in allocations to private markets remain intact, and momentum across our platform is strong. While recent market disruption has caused some observable shifts in market behavior, particularly with U.S. and European institutional investors. Investors based in the Middle East and Asia actually turned up their focus and seem to have viewed it as an opportune time to allocate capital. Individual investors were also quite level-headed and we saw no material increase in redemptions from global wealth offerings and a steady build in new capital in the first quarter.  On the product level, fundraising trends in traditional private equity are still facing some headwinds, but with a total of approximately 30 commingled and perpetual capital vehicles expected to be in market this year. We still feel confident in our ability to raise more capital than we did in 2022. We expect second quarter inflows to be particularly robust given the line of sight we have to several sizable mandates and fund closes in the near-term pipeline as Marc mentioned.  On Fund X specifically, we've received total commitments of approximately $16 billion through the end of March. Throughout the marketing process, we've experienced solid demand from repeat investors off the back of very strong Fund IX performance, which appreciated 23% in 2022 and 8% in the first quarter.  Looking forward, we have a great queue of investors in the final stages of documentation and currently expect total commitments to be in the low $20 billion range with a final close expected over summer. The amount of capital positions us with one of the largest funds in the industry and with the flexibility to lean into a range of interesting opportunities in today's markets.  We're also making meaningful progress on the six additional growth initiatives we highlighted in February. These six areas: AAA, Athene Altitude, third-party insurance, sidecars, clean transition and sponsor and secondary solutions position us to take -- tackle huge white space opportunities. These initiatives are natural extensions of our three key growth pillars and therefore, play to our strengths including complex product structuring, proprietary asset origination and, of course, generating excess return per unit of risk. As these businesses scale over the next few years, we expect our third-party fundraising will grow in size, diversity and consistency.  Here are some highlights. For AAA, an innovative core equity replacement vehicle, we're continuing to broaden distribution to both institutional and global wealth clients. In addition to the 40-plus approvals in place with independent distributors, we have a handful of new wirehouse and bank relationships geared to come online in the coming months, and conversations with family offices are also ramping up.  Just last week, we announced the launch of a Luxembourg-based product platform that provides individual investors in Europe, Asia and Latin America, access to two investment strategies, including AAA in their local currency with lower investment minimums than traditional alternative product offerings. The proposition of equity-like returns with downside protection is proving especially attractive in this highly volatile public market backdrop, and we remain very bullish on the long-term outlook for this fund.  For Athene Altitude, an innovative tax-deferred annuity wrap product, we've received positive initial feedback from several retail distribution partners. We have a few firms in late stages of due diligence and expect to launch the product more broadly in the coming months.  Within clean transition, we recently announced the launch of Apollo Clean Transition Capital or ACT Capital, with $4 billion to deploy into yield and hybrid investments in support of corporate transition to clean energy.  Meaningful seed investment from a strategic partner and our aligned pools of capital should enable us to build a diversified portfolio and investment track record from which we can eventually raise additional third-party capital. We also expect to launch the Apollo Clean Transition private equity strategy in the third quarter, which will continue to expand the scope and scale of our activity in the sustainable investing area.  And lastly, we began raising third-party capital for our inaugural equity secondaries vehicle in the second quarter, which is part of our sponsor and secondary solutions, or S3 business. As a reminder, we began investing for this strategy last fall with a chunk of seed capital from long-term strategic -- from a long-term strategic partner and AAA to help anchor the broader fundraise. Deployment activity has been strong since then, and the vehicle has committed over $1 billion of capital in transactions led by S3.  Combined with our three strategic growth pillars, these next six initiatives provide significant runway for growth. We look forward to providing updates as these exciting initiatives develop.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financial results in more detail. Sure. I'll start with the AAA question. So as I mentioned in my comments, we are really starting to hit the sweet spot of adding distribution partners to the AAA offering. To your question of where this could be on a retail basis, we could be approaching $0.5 billion to $1 billion a quarter, I think, by the end of the year. Retail plus one of the surprises we found is that this is more attractive to certain institutional investors than we would have expected when we created the product and that, of course, is a little bit lumpier, but we're starting to see real progress on that.  So in due course, we've said in the past, this could very well be Apollo's largest product. And I do really believe that over the next few years, this could be a product, $20 billion, $30-plus billion. Yes, I'll answer that. The -- look, it's exactly what we broadcast over the last year, year plus. As we've continued to scale that ACS business, right, it's about inputs and outputs. We've continued to grow the number of origination platforms, the number of products flowing into that, combined with, as we've scaled the ACS business and the number of syndicators we have, we touch more clients, more market participants. And so it's not surprising, we're seeing the steady progression.  As Marc alluded to, particularly on the credit side, we really do want to own 100% of nothing. And so by definition, that continues to feed our ACS platform. So directionally, this is heading exactly the way we would have predicted. To your point about hitting that target early, it's certainly possible that I think that 5-year plan was a little bit conservative. Yes. I would just add, as you look back and think about the evolution of the direct lending or private credit market over the last decade, that's really been a single name issuer level, mostly at the sub-investment grade, as we've certainly been doing over the last several years at the IG replacement level.  We look at the asset-backed opportunity and see similar type of evolution over the next 5 to 10 years. It's certainly what we've been doing with our own balance sheet for the last many years. That's been a key driver of the excess spread that we've been able to deliver. But ultimately, we think the rest of the market is waking up to this and will be a -- just a huge massive market opportunity. The difference being, you really do need the specialized origination, the specialized underwriting to really be able to be in that market, and that's just a huge benefit that we have that we've built -- we've worked so hard to build over the last 5, 7, 10 years. To address, so the three categories you highlighted, right, the underlying annuity holder gets the underlying rate plus some amount of excess that allows Athene's products to be attractive. Athene captures the excess spread inherent in our origination machine to be able to do that and AAA captures the return on the platform for being a creator of this attractive product. So it's actually quite a pretty logical split as to how that waterfall works. Yes, sure. So in our core private equity business, we think we're operating at the right size. A $20 billion to $25 billion footprint gives us all the capacity we need to execute on the type of transactions that we think are most attractive. A, it's among -- it puts us among the largest pools of capital out there in the private equity business. And certainly, the types of opportunistic public to privates, the scale, stressed or distressed opportunities should they arise, that's the right size of capital, meaningfully larger and perhaps it's possible. But right now, our capacity is sized -- our execution capacity is sized to that level. And certainly, the corporate environment, that really does feel like the right size. As we think about scaling, right, it obviously will come from other ancillary and related businesses. So whether it's our S3 business, our infrastructure business, our hybrid value business, just to name a few, these are platforms that are still in the maturing phases of their scale and footprint. And we do ultimately see those reaching the next stages in the coming years. But for core private equity, we think we're sitting at that sweet spot in the $20 billion size platform."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So our asset management and retirement services businesses clearly continue to create recurring and growing income streams that demonstrate stability through significant market disruptions like we saw in the first quarter.  Almost 60% of our assets under management is comprised of perpetual capital, with the remaining concentrated in long-term locked-up structures. And the funding source for our retirement services businesses, as Marc highlighted, is highly persistent with predictable long-term liabilities.  In , this creates a very resilient earnings profile particularly when considering pressures on the broader financial sector. Within our asset management Business, first quarter FRE increased by 28% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both management fees and capital solutions fees. These increases reflect the approximate of asset management inflows over the last 12 months as well as the broadening of our capital solutions capabilities as several of the substantial growth investments we've made over the past couple of years are translating into top line revenue.  Fee-generating inflows in the first quarter included $20 billion related to an investment management agreement with Atlas, for which we'll earn a 10 basis point fee. Fee-related expenses grew by 20% -- 26% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. After several years of investment in our platform, the pace of headcount growth and the rate of increase in noncompensation costs will decelerate materially in 2023, making 2022 an inflection point for FRE cost growth. Altogether, as Marc suggested, we expect to deliver some operating leverage this year while targeting 25% FRE growth.  Moving to retirement services. Athene's performance to begin the year was stellar and exceeded our expectations. Part of the outperformance reflects a more favorable investing environment while part reflects more episodic gains or timing benefits. We reported normalized net spread of approximately 160 basis points in the first quarter, the highest level the business has seen in a decade. In the first part of the year, the investing environment was very attractive and we're able to deploy incoming flows at higher on the margin yields than we anticipated.  The weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases exceeded the BBB corporate bond index by more than 150 basis points in the first quarter versus only approximately 25 basis points in all of 2022. The higher rate environment also drove net spread accretion from Athene's floating rate position and cash holdings.  Episodic or timing benefits in the quarter included fees related to financing arrangements for the Atlas transaction and some elevated fees related to certain fixed rate loans, SRE benefits in advance of the second vintage of strategic third-party sidecar capital, assuming its proportionate share of inflows from the first half of 2023 early in Q3, and we continue to expect sidecar capital to support approximately 40% of total Athene inflows this year in aggregate.  And then lastly, we expect an approximate $3 billion outflow in the third quarter related to the recapture of some older annuity liabilities by one of our affiliated partners. This will free up capital for Athene to redeploy in attractive investing environment while providing portfolio diversification for our affiliated partner, similar to the Catalina transaction in the fourth quarter of last year.  Due to the new insurance accounting standard commonly referred to as LDTI, last week, Athene recast SRE results for 2022. These new requirements drove a favorable impact to normalized SRE of $220 million in 2022, which was entirely reflected within cost of funds and translates to 12 basis points of normalized net spread benefit. We expect this benefit to persist in 2023 and the years beyond, although at an approximate 10 basis point in normalized spread terms. This effectively increases our normalized net spread target for 2023 from 135 to 140 basis points, up by 10 basis points to 145 to 150.  In addition, there are a few other moving pieces that should impact the outlook for SRE this year. First, given the deployment opportunities we're seeing in the market today, we do expect to put new money to work at better yields than we had originally forecast. And then -- but on the other hand, as Marc described, we prudently increased Athene's cash balance this quarter to provide an extra layer of stability amid heightened market volatility in March.  Normalizing for the benefit of LDTI, considering an improved deployment backlog with offsets from higher cash balances, we expect normalized SRE to slightly exceed $3 billion this year, with an estimated normalized net spread range of 150 to 155 basis points.  Let me spend a moment on capital allocation. We expect our free cash flow to be utilized to fund the base dividend, return incremental capital to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks and dividend increases and to invest in strategic growth. In any given quarter or year, we determine how to best allocate capital based on its highest returning use.  We use the following framework in making this determination. For the dividend, we aim to generate a yield in line with or better than the S&P 500, which is currently yielding approximately 2% today versus 2.8%. For opportunistic share repurchases, we target at least a high teens IRR over the medium term and that's signaling closer to 20% at current trading multiples. For strategic growth investments, we underwrite a target return equal to or better than opportunistic share repurchases with the potential for strategic upside benefits.  And all of these HoldCo capital users are weighed against growing Athene. Even without using any third-party sidecar capital from ADIP growing Athene is very compelling as it's generating an estimated low 20% pretax ROE today. This return profile is further enhanced with increasing utilization of ADIP.  In the first quarter specifically, we deployed $160 million of capital for opportunistic share repurchases, and our current orientation is to spend less on strategic investments given the large number of organic growth initiatives under development and the high bar in which we are using to consider these new opportunities. As we communicated last quarter, we expect to be a buyer of our stock on a more consistent basis as we move through our 5-year plan.  In conclusion, our financial results in the first quarter positioned us very well to execute on our strategic and financial goals for the year. We're busier than ever, we're highly focused on the significant opportunity in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. I would just add, the only difference between the valuation in the alternatives portfolio, which was 6% for the quarter and what AAA shows is just due to certain positions that are not in AAA. But they can't be for various reasons. But otherwise... Yes. So there's no difference in any way between the valuation methods. And then within the alts portfolio for the quarter, connecting back to the comments Marc made on the platforms, the platform has generated close to 10% return within that 6% for the quarter. So the origination business is healthy and high ROEs are translating into upward markets in that portfolio."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah, and good morning to all. Noah started down the path that I'd like to pick up on and really talk about the two different bets we have made versus our industry.  The first is an investment style bet. If you look across our $600 billion of AUM, you never have to worry about what strategy we're following. Every strategy is purchase price matters. Purchase price matters is grounded in facts, it's grounded in cash flow, it's grounded in business prospects.  In the equity business, which Scott will talk about, it manifests itself in a maniacal focus on low purchase price for the quality of business that we are buying. In the credit market, it manifests itself at being top of the capital structure senior secured and floating rate.  If I tick through just this quarter's results and how purchase price matters plays into this amid this market dislocation and volatility, in our credit business, corporate credit, up 3%; structured credit, up 3%; direct origination, up 5%. I hosted a webcast earlier this month for ADS and Earl Hunt, 98% of the book senior secured, floating rate, originated in '22 and in '23, great years in which to originate.  If I turn to our equity business. Private equity, up 5%; European nonperforming loans through EPF, up 2%. Literally, across the board against a backdrop of instability, purchase price matters has paid off. It is really hard not to chase the hot dot of momentum and liquidity, especially when it goes on for so long against a backdrop of money printing, but that, in fact, is what we did and why we are where we are today.  The second bet I'd like to talk about goes back to our Investor Day in October 2021. We told you at the time that we were going to make a different bet than almost everyone else in our industry. And if you look across our industry, some have bet on real estate equity, some have bet on infrastructure, some have bet on subordinated debt in BDCs, some have bet on growth.  None of these in and of themselves are bad strategies. And in fact, some of our competitors execute against these strategies quite well. But these are not our strategies. The bet we told you at the time that we were making, if you looked at the vast majority of our AUM growth was on fixed income replacement. Think of that as private investment grade.  We made a really big push into private IG. Difference in private credit is how not is how private credit is normally talked about, which normally means levered loans and below investment grade. We are the investment-grade version. This quarter, our yield AUM was some $440 billion. And while that sounds quite large, and it is the largest of the private credit businesses, this is against the backdrop of a $40 trillion market that we estimate that we would otherwise be looking at. We are simply not significant in the market. And this is the best news. We are large, but not significant. That's a position I like to work from.  Think about who we compete with and who we don't compete with. The press likes to frame private credit as an enemy of the banking system. In fact, if we think about our businesses and how we've positioned our private IG franchise, we want what the banks don't want and vice versa. So let me articulate that very clearly because I think it is important that it come out.  At the end of the day, we want the asset. We actually don't want the client because we are not prepared to cross-sell the client anything. We can't sell them equity, we can't sell them M&A, we can't sell them FX, derivatives, hedging, payments or credit cards. Ironically, for much of the banking system, the banking system wants the client, but not the asset, particularly in a world of market stress, where many banks, particularly regional banks are rethinking their strategy. I like where we sit in the food chain, I like what we're focused on, and I believe we are very well positioned.  In a time of market instability against a backdrop of a good entry point for credit at higher rates, the world is looking for safe yield. Insurance companies, including our own insurance company, Athene and Athora need safe yield. Competitive insurance companies need safe yield. Japanese banks need safe yield. Pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds need safe yield. Safe yield is, as I suggested, a potential replacement for fixed income, particularly publicly traded IG. Again, I like the hand we're playing and I like the bet we've made.  If I turn now to the two businesses. We told you for asset management that 2023 was going to be a year of execution and a recognition and achieving of all of the investments that we have made in prior years.  In addition, we projected that we would grow some 25% year-over-year in FRE. I believe we will meet that metric. We are well on our track to doing it. We experienced $57 billion of inflows in the quarter, and we're on track to far surpass last year's $130 billion. I would expect a record or as like says near record of asset management fundraising in Q2. I believe purchase price matters resonates now more than ever, and I expect a very strong year.  Equally interesting is capital deployment. Those who have followed closely over the past few weeks will see just how active we've been in the buyout business, a place we've had not had tremendous amounts of activity during the run-up in purchase price. Scott will walk you through the market activity. We have been equally busy in credit as this is a perfect entry point for what we do in private IG.  An important part of our growth today, and in fact, as I've said previously, a limiter of our growth is our capacity to originate assets that offer excess return per unit of risk. We do this both directly in terms of direct lending but we also do it via platforms. Think of platforms as businesses whose only business is the production of credit. Today, we have 16 platforms. Three of the largest are Midcap, Wheels and Atlas.  Just to give you a feel for how business is progressing. MidCap did $3.5 billion of originations year-to-date. Normally, MidCap would produce about a 14% ROE. For the most recent period of time, MidCap's ROE approaches 17%.  Wheels, which is our fleet lessor, has experienced no credit losses since the acquisition of Donlen. Again, wheels would normally produce about a 13% to 15% ROE. In the most recent period of time, Wheels ROE is approaching 19%.  Atlas integration well underway, I appreciate whoever wrote Atlas hugs versus Atlas shrugs. And in fact, I think the timing for the purchase of Atlas could not have been better. What is better than being a lender to other lenders during a time of market stress from a position of secured IG top of the capital structure, floating rate with wide spreads. We have a tremendous amount of work to do there, but we are very excited about what we've seen today.  In short, the origination business is better because of the market stress. We are filling in where the market now is suffering certain lapses, and we are earning higher spread. We are able to underwrite with a negative credit mindset. We are able to protect the downside, most of what we're doing is top of the capital structured floating rate and senior secured.  Let me turn a bit to our Capital Solutions business. In prior quarters, I've given you a little bit of our philosophy. We want generally in capital solutions, particularly in our debt business 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. As we have become an increasingly large originator and an increasingly diverse originator, this business is becoming a recurring business. The vast majority of this business and the growth I expect in the future will be around this philosophy of we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. We are becoming people's favorite stop to fill out what they need in terms of yield in their IG book without compromising credit during a period of market stress and concerned about the economic future.  Save the best for last, retirement services and Athene. 2022 was the best year in Athene's history, record inflows in earnings. 2023, I expect to be better and has started off even stronger. Every metric worked in Q1. Normalized spread of 160 basis points, new business priced very attractively, leading market share, very strong sidecar capital formation, which we will update you as we have further closings.  In short, inflows were $12 billion in the first quarter, roughly about the same as 2022. And I see this a little bit as the golden age of annuities. Consumers simply prefer 5% to 2%. It's not more complicated than that.  We built and have continued to build our international insurance relationships. We now have three significant reinsurance relationships in the Japanese market, and I expect that to be five before year-end. I expect that we will generate some $5 billion a year annually of flow reinsurance from this market. And I expect this year in terms of flow reinsurance to be the single best year in our history, somewhere between $9 billion and $10 billion of flow.  Pension activity and pension buyout activity with higher rates is ramping. We recently announced an $8 billion solution for a blue chip client, and I expect second quarter inflows at Athene to be north of $17 billion. In short, we're on track to exceed last year's record annual inflows of $48 billion.  For the quarter, normalized spread was $811 million. This was, as we've said internally a bit of a goldilock scenario. Spreads were wider than expected, rates were higher than expected. We kept more business in-house, meaning that we did not give as much to the sidecar. That will correct itself in the second half of the year but will result in higher earnings for the year.  Atlas was a net positive. In short, it all worked. In addition, as I'm sure Martin will walk through, conservative reserving methodology led to positive LDTI adjustments.  I think as we step back, we should not multiply $811 million by 4. But relative to the 20% growth in SRE that we had projected at year-end, I would expect us to have upside to that target. That is even holding some $12.7 billion of cash at [indiscernible]. We positioned ourselves defensively. We positioned ourselves to take advantage of widespread, and now we are taking advantage of widespread. When your book is in good shape, you are able to take advantage of opportunities offered in the marketplace.  Before I turn it over to Scott, and I'm anxious to turn it over to Scott because he has lots to say, I thought I would spend a minute on surrenders. Given the activity we've seen in the banking sector, we've received lots of questions about how this impacts or, in fact, does not impact the retirement services industry. Let me start with the punch line, this does not impact the retirement services industry. People who own annuities are saving for retirement. This is not money they think is accessible. When they do surrender or move it, they're typically moving to another policy. Otherwise, they incur tax burden and tax efficiency.  Finally, from our point of view, we run our book and we invest against long-term locked-in liabilities. 80% of our portfolio is nonsurrenderable or is protected by market value adjustments and surrender charges. This is not the first time we've confronted these issues. We've been doing this for a long time.  In the materials that we put out this morning, I asked the team to put out a table that really goes through the four different types of outflows that we experienced in terms of our book. The first, and I'm referring to a table that is in the materials, the first is what we call maturity driven or contractual outflows. This is exactly what you -- what it sounds like.  We enter into an FABN, it has a maturity. We originate a MIGA, it has a maturity. Those numbers are fully predictable, and you will see them from quarter-over-quarter. And I know when Athene does its deep dive call, you will see not just what has happened, but you will see Athene's projection for the next few quarters.  The next few categories, what I'll call, policy-driven outflows or policyholder driven outflows, the largest of which is income-oriented withdrawals. Recall that for retirees, when they get to a certain age, they are required to take minimum amounts out of their policies. Those minimum amounts of their policies are, in fact, what come out on a planned and on a budgeted basis. We then are left with two other types of withdrawals, from those out of surrender charge where we would expect to see more withdrawals, and for those in surrender charge where we would expect to see very few withdrawals. In fact, that is what we are experiencing.  If I look at the weeks surrounding Silicon Valley Bank and the run on Silicon Valley Bank, I compare call center volume, surrender activity or any other form of activity, simply no change. This business continues to be very, very predictable. We are matched in terms of duration, we are matched in terms of interest rates. And it gives us the confidence to invest against these liabilities and earn spread, which we then lock in for long periods of time.  In short, 2023 for us is a year of execution and one where I believe both the strategy of focusing on fixed income replacement and the investment dynamic of purchase price matters will pay off.  For us, there is so much upside for executing the base business plan but the simple shorthand for what we intend to do in 2023 is no new toys. The bar is extremely high to do something new given the opportunity in front of us. The three original growth drivers origination, capital solutions and global wealth are well on track. Scott will detail the next 6. We're driving toward operating leverage this year. It is a key point of our focus. It occupies a lot of our mind share. We achieved a little of it this quarter, but there's more to come.  Today, we end the year or we end the quarter at $600 billion of AUM, $500 billion of that in yield and hybrid. Team is in great shape, momentum is good.  And with that, I'd like to pass it to Scott. Okay. We are, as you know, broadly focused on scaling our private credit business. Our private credit business is different than most other private credit businesses in that the majority, and the vast majority of it is fixed income replacement or private investment grade. This fits very well with the space that is currently in retrenchment by the banking system because the banking system historically was not a risk taker. They were an accommodation, top of the capital structure senior secured. We, in fact, are top of the capital structure, senior secured and floating rate.  If I step back, de-banking has already been happening across our country. Following Dodd-Frank, which essentially encouraged the development of bank replacement by investors, banks, we estimate are less than 20% of all debt capital in U.S. capital markets. Given what's happened in regional banking, I expect that to become more of an investor marketplace.  The way the U.S. banks today in the investment marketplace is indirectly through securitization. If you look at growth in CLO, growth in ABS, growth in other forms of securitization, you're seeing essentially how America banks today. Atlas, the Credit Suisse Securitized Products group, along with Redding Ridge, along with MidCap, along with the Wheels, Donlen and the other platforms we have built are all focused on this marketplace.  I would expect, Alex, that you will see a tremendous tick up in securitized product relative to traditional direct lending, and it's a space that I believe has a lot of white space and where we are incredibly well positioned. And I would expect in later quarters that we will see fundraising develop around this. Investors, particularly those who have essentially invested in the first round of private credit are meaningfully underexposed to structured product and don't have great ways to have access to it. So I think this is actually a really interesting time for the platform and one in which we're well positioned. So Atlas -- it's hard to say on Atlas. Atlas had been a $70 billion book of business that I view as turning annually or every 1.5 years. At the time of acquisition, we purchased roughly a $40 billion book of business. And so I would expect you should see somewhere $30 billion, $40 billion of annual originations.  We had, prior to Atlas had originations running at close to $100 billion. As you know, our 5-year target is $150 billion of annual originations, and I believe certainly with Atlas, but also with the growth of the platform and what's happening with banking generally, I would expect that we would exceed that $150 billion of annual originations well before the date that we had projected.  With respect to the competitive nature of our business, we really do honor this 25% of everything and 100% of nothing philosophy. Some of the people you would perceive as Athene's largest competitors are actually our partners in these origination platforms. Not only do we not want 100% of any transaction, we actually are prepared to share the means of origination with people who you would have sensibly view as our competitors.  If I step back and again, think about our business, more than $500 billion of our $600 billion of AUM is partner capital where we're essentially working with the marketplace. Yes, private equity and transaction-based businesses are somewhat zero-sum, someone wins and someone loses. But for the vast majority of business, if you are our competitor, either an asset management or insurance, and you want to build, for instance, a CLO business in competition with Apollo CLO business, not only we will give you equity, we'll give you warehouse. We'll warehouse collateral for you. We'll buy your liabilities and we'll put you in business. If you want to start a broker-dealer in competition with our capital solutions business, we'll fund your broker-dealer. We are simply not in competition with any one company.  We are in a market where we are $440 billion of AUM, which sounds really large, but I assure you that the CEOs of the four big banks in the U.S. do not wake up every day wondering what the mighty Apollo is doing. We are fortunate to be really large, but at the same time, in a vast sea where we are not yet a relevant player. Okay. Thanks, Glenn, it's Marc. So first, rates in and of themselves do not fundamentally alter the shape of the business. They alter the attractiveness of the product, as I've said, because consumers prefer higher rates to lower rates. But in terms of our business model, our cost of funds pretty much adjusts with the opportunities available in the marketplace, absent unusual events like in the first quarter, where we earned excess spread. So rate moves don't really affect spread in and of themselves.  We have had the luxury because we earned adequate spread on prior books of business of holding a large floating rate position. And I'll come back to this because it's important to know that. The floating rate position did exactly what it was supposed to do. It provided excess earnings during a period of low rates moving to higher rates. You should assume that we have maintained, but normalized, the floating rate position at Athene, reflecting the current market environment.  The important thing, I think, and you didn't ask the question, but I think it's important to understand our business. When we were building Athene, we built scale inorganically by buying books of business. When rates are low, buying blocks of business is actually just fine because the business that's on the books is generally has high guarantees in a low rate environment. When you buy a block of business, it's generally outside or near the end of its surrender charge and market value adjustment period. And so you take a big risk doing inorganic deals, unless there's a huge differential between the rate environment and the guarantee and the policy. We were -- spreads were so wide when we were building that business that we could actually afford to hedge that risk through floating rate.  What's happening today, we haven't done an inorganic deal in about 3 years. The cost of inorganic deals, given the competition in the marketplace exceeds meaningfully the cost of funds with newly issued, newly protected surrender charges and market value adjustments. What we are seeing today is the last desperate attempt of people in our industry trying to build scale. Think about what's happening, all the concerns that investors have about surrenders and policyholder behavior, someone who buys a block of business today, is buying generally old surrender charges, old market value adjustments that are burning off, and they're buying into a rate environment that is high where consumers have alternatives. So you would not expect to be able to hedge that block in a meaningful way.  So I view this as kind of the interesting thing in our industry. I think it's going to be very hard to get to scale in this rate environment, absent a meaningful organic origination engine because you simply do not want to invest or put capital behind policies that are not protected by surrender charges, market value adjustments or other contractual or economic incentives. Maybe I'll hit Athene Altitude. So we've articulated previously, and I certainly have been quoted publicly stating that over the next 5 years, I expect that high net worth investors will be better than 50% allocated to alternatives. That always elicits certainly a look because it is not where the people are today. But I start with a definition of an alternative.  To us, as an alternative is nothing other than an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds. And I believe alternatives go from AA to equity. So when I say 50% allocated to alternatives, I do not believe they will be allocated to private equity or venture capital or risk but to alternatives in the newer definition that I've suggested.  Today, you can buy from Apollo investment-grade only yield. You can buy total return, you can buy opportunistic credit, you can buy REIT, you can buy BDC, you can buy our credit strategies head fund and you can buy AAA, all wrapped in an Altitude annuity for an excess cost of 30 basis points with no further restrictions.  We, as an industry, are in the early stages of addressing the needs of high net worth and retail investors versus institutions. One of the key differences is institutions are not taxpayers. They generally are pension funds or endowments or other types of tax exempts. So our industry has not historically been as tax sensitive. So if you think of the experience of a BDC investor in a high-tax state, an 8% dividend yield looks like 3.8% to the consumer. That's not as attractive as .  But we are in an education phase and the whole growth of alternatives is about education. And retail investors and their financial advisers first need to understand the products. And they are getting an education in products, and we are doing our part and other firms in the industry are responsibly doing their part. This next layer of Altitude and wrapping is yet another bit of education. So we are selling this product today mostly to high net worth individuals and family offices, and this product will get increased amounts of traction as Martin or Scott in their remarks suggested.  I believe we will have our first broad distribution of this at some point this year. And you should expect us, as new products come online, we will continue to build out the family of products under the Altitude brand. So it's Marc. On a normalized basis, we hold about 12 -- excuse me, $6 billion, $6.5 billion of cash. So this is about $6 billion of extra cash. For those of you I've seen in person or have attended a call with, I remember in the early days of the banking crisis, calling out to Jim Belardi and asking him to give me the benefit of some leeway. I was going to ask him to do something that had no justification other than feel, which was to massively increase our cash balances at the point of instability we were watching Credit Suisse and Signature and SVB. And Jim did that. And ironically, it's positioned him to take advantage of wider spread. So in hindsight, I think it's been no harm no foul, and I would expect to see cash balances come down.  The question on outflows, I hope we answered better in terms of the table that we disclosed, but I'll come back to you and I'll speak philosophically first. When we construct a product, we put a lot of benefits into the product. We strip away the excess features that give rise to volatility that consumers really don't know how to value anyway and we put it into the price. And yet we create a very low cost of funds, and we've gone from a start-up to the largest provider and the largest market share in the U.S. market. That is no mean feat. But when a product comes out of surrender charge or its market value adjustment burns off, we take the product to its contractual minimum. We want the product to surrender because we cannot invest and earn spread against a product that is redeemable at any point in time.  This is true across the industry. It is not just us who follows this as a point in time. And recall, policies generally do not leave the industry, they recycle because otherwise, people suffer tax consequences, and this is a retirement product. This is not a demand deposit.  What's happening to us, and we are seeing the benefit of is we were a zero market share, and now we're the largest market share. We are the benefit of this recycling at a point in time in the industry. when rates are higher, and therefore, consumers are more interested in annuities. And the whole industry is up. We're just up more than about anyone else.  So I come back to the specifics now in how surrenders work. The maturity cycle of contractual-based outflows will go up and down based on the business that we see 3, 5, 7 years ago. We can tell you pretty much quarter-by-quarter, and Athene will do that in their deep dive, what's the contractual maturity driven outcomes will be. In some quarters, it will be up, some quarters it will be down. You can actually look back to this quarter, that maturity driven was 3%. Q3 in 2022, it was 5.7%. You should expect to see a lot of volatility in that line based on business done 3, 5 and 7 years ago.  Income with policyholder driven outflows, the three categories, for income-oriented withdrawals, you should see this as a steady amount of money that goes out based on the age of policyholder and their proclivity or need or legal requirement to take income. This is also planned.  The next line is from policies out of surrender charge. This is also planned. This gets to the point I just made. We take contractual minimums on policies that burn off their surrender charges to as low as we possibly can. We want these people to surrender. This is a relatively small amount because the vast majority of policyholders surrender at maturity. 10% approximately of the people forget they have a policy and some point in the future, they wake up and discover they have a policy that's out of surrender charge. And so this number, you can see bumps around back and forth. It's neither high or low. It's a relatively small number.  The thing that we watch pretty closely because it is the basis of our business, we look at policies and surrender charges. These are, to some extent, unplanned. These are what I would call life issues. This is health issues, death, divorce or other change in life circumstances, we generally don't see changes in these kinds of surrenders as a result of interest rates or financial markets activity. And if you go back and you look in time, this quarter, unexceptional. And you should expect and we budget that number to be kind of unexceptional on a go-forward basis.  So again, I step back and I look at this industry, and it's not the first time we've done this. This industry has been resilient over a really long period of time. You go back to the financial crisis and you think about how central AIG was to the -- in the financial crisis in 2008, really no move. If you think about Genworth, who also had its troubles in the financial crisis, also no move. Don't see anything really going on here that changes the way I think about the business. And I think we will do the best job we possibly can to give you a prediction of outflows. And the primary thing that varies is maturity driven contractual-based outflows quarter-by-quarter. So I'll do a start, and then I'll turn it over to Martin. It's Marc. So the valuation process, whether it was on Athene's balance sheet or in AAA hasn't changed and makes no difference. The vast majority of the origination vehicles are held or valued on a basis of book value and ROE. And as you would imagine, in this environment, they are on the margin moving up. But there's not a tremendous amount of volatility because these are, for the most part, book value-based entities that track how they're doing in ROEs, and ROEs have been very stable over a long period of time. And Martin... I think of -- just here, I think Athora or Catalina, other insurance companies can't be for regulatory and other reasons in AAA. And those positions are held out. Otherwise, 100% of the alternatives portfolio is, in fact, in AAA. Look, I'll start at the top of the ecosystem. I'll invite Scott to add as we go. So I start at the top of the ecosystem, the U.S. economy needs credit, consumers and businesses as a result of GDP and GDP growth. How that credit is provided has been in a secular change, particularly since Dodd-Frank, with more of that credit coming from the -- from investors who are the new banks versus from the banking system, government guarantee, government-backed deposit insured banks. So as a general matter, investors are supplying more credit relative to the banking system. Then we have this growth of something we call private credit, but those are two words that don't really mean anything. They just sound like they mean something because private credit can be AA or private credit can be highly risky CCC. For the most part, popular press has taken private credit to mean levered lending, which is below investment grade, which is a relatively small part of the private credit ecosystem.  Yet when investors talk about private credit and their allocation to private credit, and they sometimes use the term direct lending, almost all of that is focused on the below investment grade levered lending or direct lending. And people also think about lending in corporate format because that is the most familiar, the most common way people think about it.  For our ecosystem, we love the direct lending, below investment-grade levered lending business sometimes. Right now, we happen to love it. There's not a lot of providers. Funds are still needed. We can make commitments underwriting in a negative mindset, we can earn wide spreads, and there's a shortage of capital so we have good deal selection. Now is a good entry point to below investment grade, levered lending, private credit, direct lending, however you define it.  The point I was making is when you look at the macro of how the country is now banking in the investor marketplace, it doesn't bank primarily by selling loans in direct form to investors. It banks indirectly through securitization. When you look at the growth in ABS, when you look at the growth in other forms of structured product, that is now how America banks. And if you go to our website and you actually look at performance, not just put out by us, by put out by others, you would see that a fair read of all of the information available is that if you look at an investment-grade corporate bond today versus an investment-grade securitized product, you would conclude that at the same ratings point, the investment-grade securitized product is a better credit, which just makes sense.  Because what we've seen in the economy taking place is a significant pickup in the pace of technological change, consumer change, societal change, cultural change. And therefore, we've had more single points of failure in single investment-grade corporate issues, think SVB, think Credit Suisse, versus what securitization gives you, which is the benefit of diversification, which now has more value than ever. And it's not just Apollo saying this. This is almost everyone who has looked at the topic in an academic sense.  So investors are, for the most part, exposed to private credit and directly lending and corporate format in below investment grade. They are at the early stages of fixed income replacement of taking their IG portfolio and rotating it into something that offers them at the same ratings point, 200 to 300 basis points more. Insurance companies, others have been doing this for a really long time. And I believe that investors will also enter this market in a big way. And therefore, I think there's a lot of running room in the securitized marketplace. But once again, make a distinction between investment grade, which is a vast -- a large market and below investment grade, which is an opportunistic still really interesting market, sometimes. So it's Marc. The short answer is no. But I have said previously the capacity to produce excess spread or more broadly, excess return per unit of risk is the limiter of growth in our business.  In alternatives, if we are true to what we're doing, we only exist to provide this excess return per unit of risk. Otherwise, investors should be public and shouldn't leave with any liquidity restrictions. So it is our job to grow it and not try to grow our AUM any faster than we have excess spread per unit of risk.  So far, we have been good at balancing that. But we look at this all the time. This is ultimately the cap if you will, on an intelligent way to grow a long-term alternatives franchise that meets investors' needs. So it's Marc. So with higher rates for the most part, corporates who are the primary people who execute pension group annuity transactions, find this more attractive because they simply have to contribute less to close a gap if there is a gap in the underlying. Now I wish the equation were just that simple. But of course, it depends how they were positioned. Because if they were positioned in long-duration bonds and rates go up, their gap gets wider. If they were positioned in equities and equities sell off, their gap gets wider.  But for the most part, corporations considering pension group annuities, have been guiding towards a strategy that gets them to a more market neutral place, think shorter duration fixed income, less esoteric in the equity business. And so the benefit of higher rates is for this business overall a net positive.  This is a trust business that comes from having lots of capital, by having an institutional capability to pass independent fiduciaries and by having the know-how to do and onboard 100,000 clients at a time. There is a handful of companies in our industry who have met all those requirements. It is a competitive but less competitive market than the origination business, which itself is significantly less competitive than the inorganic buying of blocks business, which I've already given you my comments on, which I think is in its final throes.  So I -- for one, I'm excited about pension group annuities. I think the team at Athene is second to none and the pipeline is as it should be."

This call may contain -- or this call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business.

Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest -- and interest in any Apollo fund. I will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Thanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. We reported strong third quarter financial results that included record fee-related earnings of $531 million or $0.87 per share, near-record spread-related earnings of $856 million or $1.40 per share and adjusted net income of $1.1 billion or $1.85 per share, which reached the second highest level on record. Additionally, I'd like to take a moment to thank you all for participating in our Investor Day last month. We were thrilled to have fantastic attendance, with over 3,000 people participating live in addition to another 54,000 who have accessed the replay since then. Given our proximity to this comprehensive event, today's call will be a shorter update. I'm joined this morning by Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. Marc and Martin will cover prepared remarks, and Jim will be available for Q&A. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah, and good morning. I want to echo Noah's sentiment that we take nothing for granted, and we deeply appreciate your willingness to spend 3 to 4 hours with us on Investor Day to truly dig into the unique business that we are building. Hopefully, we outlined a clear vision for our 5-year plan as well as the upside drivers. In summary, for those who did not suffer through the 3 to 4 hours, we talked about average annual FRE growth of 20% and average annual SRE growth of 10%, FRE and SRE reaching $10 billion, $5 billion each in 2029 and ANI more than doubling to $15 a share by 2029. Capital generation of $21 billion. In short, we laid out ambitious targets, but they're targets the management team and I are fully behind and believe we can meet. Third quarter was a solid start in that direction. In short, everything worked. The team made all of us look good. We will open the frozen yogurt bar today to reward the team for that. It's one of the tools we joked about on Investor Day, but it's part of the culture of Apollo. Let me spend a second as to how the long-term business plan in the quarter relate to each other. In terms of our 5-year plan, we laid out 4 mega trends or tailwinds we thought were going to drive ourselves on our industry forward over the next 5 years: The so-called global industrial renaissance and this massive need for capital to rebuild infrastructure, energy transition and next-gen power and data; the second, retirement; the third is the growth of individuals, complementing institutions who have long been the sole source of capital for private assets; and finally, the notion of public and private convergence. In short, any of these 4 TAMs could double our business over the next 5 years. It is up to us to execute against this opportunity set and to position the franchise squarely in front of these very strong tailwinds. We are fortunate in many ways that even at our size and scale, in the scheme of the asset management industry, we are a relatively small player. And while we project that we will double our business over the next 5 years, that is not all that large, particularly compared to the enormous TAMs in front of us. Bringing it down to the quarter, in terms of global industrial renaissance and the massive need for capital, this was a record origination quarter, $62 billion of originations for the quarter, $194 billion year-to-date. Platforms, really strong quarter. ATLAS, in particular, had a really strong quarter, $50 billion of cumulative origination to date, $5 billion of equity capital raised, a new $5 billion facility from BNP, 350-person strong. In short, the cylinders are all firing at ATLAS, and we expect great things from them going forward. In retirement, Athene had another $20 billion organic growth quarter. We continue to widen the funnel through distribution expansion. Just launched with BAML last week, another top 15 platform. Away from Athene, we continue to make inroads into the retirement space, in particular, in the DC market. We have our first mandate for our AAA product on an RIA platform. We are in the equity sleeve of a CIT offering, and we launched in October. While technical, this is an enormous milestone for us and I believe portends well for the future in front of us in adding private assets to help bulk and accelerate retirement solutions for those in need. In terms of individual investors in progress against retail, fundraising is on pace to increase 50% year-over-year in '24 without a flagship fund. The team here has done an extraordinary job. ABC, our asset-based company, is now distributing on 2 large wire house platforms. ASPM, our evergreen multi-asset secondary strategy, launched globally. We now have, post these 2, 11 wealth products focused on the market, 6 of which have been in the market for a year or less. But I want to really call out here what the potential of what this can be. Recall that our strategy here is to be seen as an innovator in this marketplace. So AAA, which we talked about 1.5 years ago, we've now crossed $18.5 billion and we expect to be circa $20 billion by year-end. Strong returns here, now approximately 10.5%, with a fraction of the volatility of public equity markets and public debt markets. This is the kind of product that has multiple uses across portfolios. And I stick by what I said when we launched the product, I expect this to be the largest fund at Apollo within a very short period of time. And I think next year will be when that happens. ADS, also really strong performance. Durable yield, taking advantage of trends in private credit, but done in an Apollo-esque way, lowest leverage, all first lean. We expect the strategy to be circa $15 billion at year-end. I cite the size of this because I think it's important to show just how fast this channel is developing. And the channel development is about product, it is about performance, but it's also about the capability to serve this large and growing market and the capability to continue to innovate. We learn something almost every day in this marketplace. To cite just one example, we talked a year ago about an insurance-wrapped product to take advantage of the unique tax situation of individual investors. Our Altitude series, which encompasses our insurance-wrapped product, we expect to be circa $1 billion at year-end and now active in 2 significant wire houses. Those 3 trends, global industrial renaissance, retirement and growth in the retail channel are 3 of the 4 cylinders that we expect or 3 of the 4 tailwinds that we expect to power our business going forward. The fourth is this whole notion of public and private convergence. We see this as fixed income replacement. What we're watching take place is investors who have historically allocated to private markets solely out of their alternative bucket, are beginning to allocate out of their fixed income bucket, which historically, has been 100% public investment grade. We expect that over time, investors will begin to divide this bucket between beta, public investment grade; and alpha, private investment grade. And they will consume that in a number of different formats. Some will consume directly as pure private assets, some will consume it in fund format, and yet others will consume it in products that are more familiar to them from more familiar names, such as the partnerships and the relationships we've announced with Lord Abbett. and with State Street. More on that product when it is approved because it is currently in registration. Those 4 tailwinds, I believe, will push our business forward and they will push our industry forward. But all of them ultimately depend on one factor. They depend on our capacity to originate assets that offer excess return per unit of risk or alpha. We are not solely an asset manager. If we behave like an asset manager and simply gather funds, we will simply degrade our business and degrade our franchise. That is not our intention, and that is not what we're going to do. Our capacity to grow is limited, as I've said previously, by our ability to originate, and we are keenly focused on how we go about doing this. We have a number of platforms, some 16, which we've spent roughly $8 billion building over the past 15 years that now employs circa 4,000 people. This is a very significant investment and a bar that many of our competitors will need to cross to compete with us in this area. Some will do that, and we expect them to do that. But make no mistake, this market is enormous, but one has to originate good risk to be able to grow their business and offer their clients excess return per unit of risk. In the 3.5 hours that we talked during our Investor Day, I wish we could have covered everything, but we failed to. One area I really want to drive home and talk about our recent promotion is our third-party insurance. We have built, for Athene, the capacity to originate good assets and have proven over the past 15 years that we can scale our retirement services business. Recall that as an originator of assets, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. In some ways, the ideal partners for us are other insurers, people who are trying to amortize the same sorts of liabilities that we're seeking to amortize and deal with the same capital and regulatory regimes. Our third-party insurance business is approximately $100 billion of AUM as of this date, and we expect it to double over the next 5 years. But it will not double on its own. And so we've taken one of our most senior partners, Jeff Jacobs, and asked Jeff to become the CEO of our third-party insurance business with all of the resources of the firm at his disposal. This is important to us not just in the capacity to add AUM, but also to support an industry and to support retirement and to make sure that there's a broad understanding of the regulatory and capital regimes associated with private assets, particularly private investment grade, and it's an area that will receive lots of attention from us. In short, we're playing to win. Lots of the terms we've used across the industry, this notion of origination, fixed income replacement and an industrial renaissance now seem to be mainstream. We believe we are building something unique in the context of our industry, and we believe we are uniquely positioned for this opportunity, with the capacity to originate the right cost and form of capital and the right culture to succeed. In short, we get to do this. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. So third quarter financial results across FRE, SRE and PII exceeded expectations and position us well to close out 2024, consistent with our expectations and to move confidently into the first year of our latest 5-year plan. I'll make some very brief comments on this quarter's results before opening up to Q&A. Fee-related earnings. Within asset management, FRE reached a new quarterly record and surpassed $1.5 billion on a year-to-date basis, supported by strength in fee-related revenues from our credit business. Credit management fees increased 20% year-over-year, with growth in third-party credit management fees exceeding that of Athene and Athora. Over the last 12 months, we've generated more than $140 billion of inflows to support continued management fee growth. In the third quarter, credit inflows totaled $39 billion, inclusive of the robust flows of Athene that Marc mentioned as well as broad-based fundraising activity across direct lending, opportunistic and multicredit and further inflows related to financing our ATLAS business. Our Capital Solutions business posted its second highest quarter of fees on record, supported by approximately 80 underlying transactions. Fee-related performance fees were also strong, increasing more than 40% year-over-year. This fee stream has primarily driven by stable, spread-based income from certain credit products and vehicles including ADS. Going into the fourth quarter, we expect these revenue growth trends to largely persist, supported by our previously discussed organic capital formation target of $120 million for full year 2024, and a strong, diversified origination pipeline. At the same time, we've remained focused on cost discipline, with total expenses increasing 11% year-to-date versus the prior 9-month period, excluding the impact of $15 million of fund merger costs in the second quarter that we previously commented on. Turning to retirement services. SRE results reflect robust organic growth trends of $20 billion in the quarter and solid levels of spread profitability. Net spread, excluding notable items, increased by 16 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and was roughly flat with Q2 when adjusting for our long-term expectations of an 11% alternatives return. As part of this, Athene's alternatives portfolio generated an 8.2% annualized return in the third quarter, within which AAA generated a 10.5% annualized return, approaching the 11% long-term expectation. We took several actions with respect to Athene's alternatives portfolio within Q3 to align the allocation more closely with AAA, which now accounts for approximately 80% of the portfolio at quarter end. Starting in January and going forward, we intend to pre-release return information around the first business day following quarter end in an effort to provide more near-term visibility into this line item. Turning to the year-to-date view. SRE totaled $2.4 billion, up 5% versus the prior year comparable period when excluding notable items. As we described in detail at Investor Day, we expect SRE to approximate $3.2 billion for the full year, which implies a similar level of SRE in the fourth quarter versus third quarter results on an as-reported basis. Principal investing income benefited from some monetizations by Fund IX during the quarter. Our net accrued performance fee balance at September 30 was $1.4 billion and continues to be supported by strong investment performance. We generated double-digit returns across a variety of credit strategies and hybrid value over the last 12 months, as well as more than 30% for PE Fund X over the same period. While we expect near-term realizations activity to be more in line with recent quarterly trends based on our current pipeline, we're optimistic that PII will increase meaningfully over the next couple of years as the exit environment improves. In terms of capital allocation, we deployed more than $400 million within Q3 to opportunistically repurchase more than 4 million shares at an average price of $105 amid heightened volatility during the quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: So I was hoping you could start with the progress you guys are making on third-party fundraising, and particularly with respect to the insurance channel, Marc, as you mentioned earlier. A couple of specifics. Maybe you can give us an update on the flows you're seeing there year-to-date. I heard $100 billion in total AUM, but curious on the growth and the topic fee rates you're seeing in that channel. And just broadly, when you think about the addressable market there, what sort of changed that sort of enables some of these insurance companies to partner with you guys as a competitor in some way? And in terms of the liabilities that you're looking for in this channel, is this strictly in the annuity kind of rider channel or sort of broad insurance based?\nMarc Rowan: So I'm going to -- it's Marc, Alex. I'm going to start more generally, and then Jim will pick up specifically. A bunch of the things you've said really don't track with how things have done. We have always started and always run a third-party business. People who you would think would be -- who are our competitors in the liability, we partner with on the asset side regularly. Not only do we partner with them in an aligned fashion for the assets themselves, but you know from our public announcements that a number of people you would consider our direct competitors own pro rata side-by-side pieces of our origination platform. We intend to continue to do this going forward. Unlike certain very constrained markets, for instance, like private equity, the market for private investment grade, I believe, to be vast. And this is about having the capital to go after them. And also recall that we -- although we originate a risk, we want some of that risk for the Athene balance sheet. We want some of that risk for our credit funds and the other accounts that we manage on behalf of our third-party clients. At this point in time and for the foreseeable future, having like-minded institutions, particularly insurers who have the same risk reward and the same regulatory and the same capital regimes is additive to our franchise and it's additive to their franchise. Competitively, we still take a very, very large share of these assets and no one competitor has anything near it. And we -- but we view this as beneficial to our franchise. And in turn, if one of our peer insurance companies originates risk that we think is interesting and they want us to participate with them, we will. It's a very different ecosystem than people have historically thought of in the private equity area, where it's a winner-take-all mentality. I sometimes joke in credit that if you originate a risk and own 100% of it, it means you made a mistake rather than you won something. The second part before I turn to Jim, is we have 2 or 3 different types of insurance accounting. By the way, they're mostly life and annuity, not PNC, just to touch on that. Some of third-party insurance are direct placements with peer insurance companies, either through programmatic investments, one-off investments or in the context of funds or SMAs, a very big part of our business. But increasingly, we actually see people partnering with us, institutions and, in some cases, other financial institutions, side-by-side with us in ADIP. ADIP gives participants not just a share of the assets, but a share of the liabilities, and they get to leverage off the Athene cost structure. Although we didn't talk about it this quarter, when you have a chance to go back, Athene continues to do an unbelievable job on the efficiency operations. I saw some numbers from the quarter. I, quite frankly, was impressed. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim.\nJames Zelter: Yes. Not a lot to add, Alex, but I would say that what Marc has described is this open architecture flywheel. And whether it's in funds, whether it's in ADIP, whether it's sharing views on how CLO should be looked at and calculated from a regulatory perspective, there's a whole variety of activity that takes place. And we have always been a player in this space. But as Marc mentioned, by putting  one of our senior individuals who has really been at the intersection of the Athene portfolio leadership, applying that same insight, sourcing, portfolio, construction across the environment is helpful. And again, this is mostly investment-grade activity. And the reason why we think it can grow so large is, for the most part, all this activity, if you get into investment grade and fixed income replacement, this is really dispersion of credit risk across the platform and across the ecosystem, not just the creation, which is really more the traditional direct origination. So the scale and substance of these activities, we think is -- we're still in the early days.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hope everyone is doing well. My question is on retirement outflows. So after a pickup last quarter, they improved back down to the 10% range annualized, kind of right in line with your target from the Athene presentation from August. But from the same disclosure, they're expected to decline again modestly in 4Q '24, but we actually don't have any visibility into 2025. So I'm wondering if you could share with us how liability outflows are expected to trend in 2025. And for the full year, is it generally in line with 2024 with some quarterly deviations?\nMarc Rowan: It's Marc for one second. So during the substantial run-up in interest rates, there was a tremendous amount of interest from the research community and from shareholders into the behavior of liabilities. And so we began to publish the statistics that we used actually to run our business. The runoff of insurance liabilities is actually highly predictable. And one of the things we wanted to do by publishing is to show that we actually have a pretty good sense of when period-end business, MYGA business is going to run off. We have a regular flow of pension risk transfer business and a regular flow of runoff of fixed income annuities as well as policy loans and other out-of-period surrenders. I think the easiest thing to do is probably update our '25 forecast. But with Investor Day, we didn't get around to it. I think that's -- it's on our to-do list.\nMartin Kelly: It's high up the list. We plan to. I would say I'm not aware of anyone else in the industry that publishes this information. And so it's another area where we strive to be transparent. And we track very closely against the metric. And as Marc said, the ups and downs from any one quarter to the next tend to be driven by contractual features or policies, and so they're highly predictable. Looking ahead, I wouldn't expect any different trend from what we're seeing. It's just tracking exactly as we expect.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Bill Katz of TD Cowen.\nWilliam Katz: Marc, I'm intrigued by two of your comments, just your notion of the retirement opportunity as well as the retail. I think I want to ask about retirement, but I'm going to ask about retail. In terms of the retail platform, you mentioned you're learning a lot. So I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand how you see the opportunity set evolving for the industry and Apollo's role in that. And then secondarily, a number of your peers have been sort of speaking to higher expenses to build out the wealth management footprint. Could you share with us where you are in terms of that expense cycle?\nMarc Rowan: So I'm tempted to answer your retail question with a retirement answer, but I'm actually going to go after the retail side of it. So we're in the very early stages. I think one of the things we tried to do at Investor Day was to present this pyramid of how we think about the retail channel. At the top of the pyramid, we think about family office. Family office to us is really nothing other than institutional. We cover them like institutions. They behave like institutions. As best we can tell, they are now close to 50% private, which does not mean alternative, but -- in a traditional sense, but 50% private. At the bottom of the pyramid, I call that mass affluent, I hypothesize that we were not likely to serve these people directly, that we were likely to be a parts provider to incumbent asset managers, traditional asset managers who were going to blend in a number of different formats, private assets into products that are more easily understood by the vast majority of investors who will not on their own, go through the educational process and perhaps are not closely advised by a financial adviser. The channel that we -- I think you're referencing is really talking about the advice channel, which let's call that high net worth, which has lots of different definitions. For us, I think that this is a question of appropriate products and services. They generally do not buy products that have binary outcomes. They buy things that are more yield-oriented that tend to pull to par or have more predictable behavior, although episodically, they do buy traditional alternative products in fund format, but that is not the vast majority of what we're talking about. If you think about these institutions, serving these institutions is going to be, in my opinion, an opportunity for a handful of firms. The scale that one needs to put together of people, technology, products, systems to serve one of the large wealth channel participants really only makes sense if you are multiple products at a large scale and are capable of generating alpha. Let's not forget that at the end of the day, we're not just an asset manager, we have to develop excess return. For better or worse, I think we envisioned the cost of doing this. I don't view the cost as a surprise. They've been contemplated in the context of the budgets and forecast we've given you. So I would not call out anything unique. I think the interesting thing that's happening in this business is when we enter a certain channel, we say, \"Oh, we're partnered with so and so.\" The reality is we're still selling to 5% or 10% of their financial advisers and their clients, we have -- we, all of us, have yet to fully penetrate any of these systems. To fully penetrate a system, we have to make our products simpler. We have to be able to serve qualified and nonqualified investors. And we have to be able to do it with technological ease. And so we are not so much seeing cost pressure. What we're seeing is requests for services. This can be educational services. This can be technological services. This can be ease of doing business services. And perhaps one of the most intriguing, something we've referred to previously is the addition of regular way, low-cost leverage. And with that, I'll turn it to Jim to see if he wants to add anything.\nJames Zelter: Yes. And what Marc is really talking about is taking a product dialogue and making it much more of a portfolio solutions dialogue. And we're at the head of the pack in terms of the breadth of products that we've created. As Marc said, the clients don't want -- they don't want binary outcomes, they want a lot more evergreen products. But the latest note that Marc mentioned, whether it's -- certainly, in the equity business, in the public equity business, the ability to buy things on margin. Well, certainly, there will be a time in the future where whether it's fund finance or other or even portfolio solutions in terms of SAA, strategic asset allocation, how a client looks at a variety of these options. So it's much more holistic. There will be a few winners. We plan -- we have planted our flag with resources and commitment and vision to be a successful player.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So I'm actually going to ask a question around the retirement opportunity. At Investor Day, Marc, you did make a compelling case for a rethink of the future state of target date fund allocations around the $15 trillion DC opportunity. As we think about what is tangible on a near-term basis in terms of allocations and how that might evolve, the percentage that's in target date funds, it looks like less than half of DC assets are currently held in target date funds. The majority of those fund assets are held by folks in higher age cohorts. So I wanted to get your perspective on how you see that opportunity evolving over time, how much of that $15 trillion do you believe you can service on a more near- to medium-term basis once that new market opportunity hopefully opens up to you and your peers?\nMarc Rowan: So I'll start by saying that I did point it out, but it is not something we've budgeted in our plan or to get to our 5-year plan. But I think we have to just look around the world for solutions, and I did mention at Investor Day. In places in the world where private assets, and I'm not talking about alternate, but private assets have been added to portfolios, societies have gotten superior outcomes. Australia is probably the most visible place where superannuation has achieved very, very successful returns for retirees in Australia. And one can demonstrate that if you look at the inclusion of private assets along with traditional assets in a blend, we're talking about outcomes that are not slightly better, we're talking about 40% to 60% better outcomes. Over time, I believe people will see the light, and we will eventually have the inclusion of private assets in what would be traditionally public-only portfolios. Right now, recordkeeping, rule of law or practice, really, have kept significant allocations out of that for the time being to the detriment, I believe, of the participants in these plans. But the retirement opportunity is not just about the $12 trillion to $13 trillion of 401(k) and having a slice of that participate in private assets, it is also about rethinking retirement more generally. If I look at our 15 years so far at Athene, I have to really commend the team. They have done an incredible job. They took a start-up, and they turned it into the largest organic originator of retirement products in the U.S. and I believe, in the world. And they do it really efficiently. they do it really well, and they earn very nice rates of return. But if we're honest, what they've done is they have taken a traditional product set that has not really been updated all that much over the past 15 years, and they've just done a better job, and they've offered consumers a piece of the private market's alpha to create better outcomes, and it turns out consumers prefer more to less. I believe there is an opportunity to rethink the product set itself. And we had a little discussion at Investor Day, the notion of simplification and getting to guaranteed lifetime income, I believe, to be the North Star for where we would like to go. Whether we get all the way there in a simple product that offers guaranteed lifetime income, we had a little back and forth at Investor Day, but that is what we're pursuing. But this notion of rethinking the product set, I believe to be the single biggest opportunity in front of us, and that is what is baked into our 5-year plan over the next few years. Should we get access to 401(k) through broad-based reform or regulatory change or regulatory encouragement? I believe that would be upside, not just for us, but for the entire industry, limited, of course, by all of our capacity to originate. At the end of the day, this comes back to origination.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mike Brown of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Brown: I guess building on that discussion, I wanted to ask about the AAA sleeve in the CIT offering that you flagged, Marc. Do you have a pipeline of other opportunities building on other RIA platforms? And I guess, how do you see this expanding? Can it eventually move to wire houses, for example, on kind of like model portfolio structures?\nMarc Rowan: So I'll start in reverse. So AAA today is circa $18.5 billion. We expect it to be circa $20 billion at year-end. It is broadly -- it's an equity product, but it is a hybrid type equity, meaning it has lower volatility than traditional equities. And its notion is to produce low double-digit rates of return with much less volatility than public equities. Recall that public equities over a long period of time with volatility offer 9% to 10%. So the use case here is in part equity replacement and in part, risk reduction through hybrid without yet moving to fixed income and lower rates of return. We are seeing it adopted in portfolio allocation. Right now, it is still being purchased as a product. Someone comes and subscribes to AAA because they want to be in AAA. But I do envision a day when we will be talking about 60-40 portfolios that are comprised of public and private. I do think the future of the retail business will in part be portfolio solutions. In the retirement space, in this first CIT, that is essentially what is happening. It is an equity -- it's part of the equity sleeve that is the default offering for equity for this group and plan of retirees. Pipeline, I believe, would overstate the progress to date. I am very happy to see the first and first couple of individuals and firms who are beginning to look at this as part of an overall solution. And let us do a good job doing this, and we'll grow from there. But too early to say pipeline.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research.\nPatrick Davitt: Going back to Bill's question, it sounds like, obviously, you're getting a lot of traction adding retail distribution. But on that, another manager last week is seemingly talking down near-term margin expectations primarily as a result of the ramp of payments directly to the distribution platforms. And we aren't really hearing that message from you or others for that matter. So is this a headwind we should expect to see more of? And in that vein, maybe expand on how you account for those and why it might be different than others are.\nMartin Kelly: Patrick, it's Martin. So we're not seeing that headwind. I would say if you look at how retail product is distributed, in whatever -- through whatever channel, there is a reasonably large segment of the distribution, which incurs no cost. So think family office, we cover family office ourselves. There's no sort of external cost to distribute that product. And there are a couple of other channels which are similar. Within the channels that we do incur a cost, the cost can come in 1 of 2 forms. It can be either a trailer against revenues, which is just netted against the revenue line or it can be an upfront placement fee, and that's expensed as it's incurred. And we're still early days in this whole evolution. But what we're seeing is a migration of the costs from upfront fees to trailer fees. And I think that reflects the quality of the product and the stickiness of the product. But you'll see within -- all of this is contemplated in the plan that we've laid out. We don't expect to see margin degradation from it. And I think you'll see a majority of the costs over time will be netted against revenues versus an explicit non-comp cost. So hopefully, that helps put the pieces together.\nMarc Rowan: I'll add a little bit to it. And this is a part of a broader outlook. I mean part of what is implicit in the discussion that we've been having of origination is that we expect private assets to be -- have lots of demand and to be in shorter supply. If we're right about that, we would expect fees to be stable over a long period of time, unless there is something unexpected that happens in the industry. We've built this entire business, our industry, out of the smallest bucket of our institutional clients called alternatives. All of a sudden, we have 3 new sources of demand for private assets. Retirement is full swing into private assets. Insurance companies and others have been for a long period of time, and you're seeing them broaden out what they do. The second is individuals, individuals both through the retail channels that you've been talking about, but also through the convergence of public and private, the inclusion of private assets in public products. So we see that as really interesting growth to what's happening. And then we see our institutions who historically have only invested in private assets out of their alternative business beginning to invest in private assets out of their much larger and heretofore untapped fixed income bucket. If we're right, we expect there to be significant demand for private assets, and the supply of private assets is not the same as the supply for an asset manager. It is up to each of the firms in their respective areas and where they have expertise to generate these assets that offer excess return per unit of risk. That's after all the promise of private markets.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: So thanks for the adjusted metric of origination. It looks like it largely maps to the prior debt origination disclosure, but maybe can you speak to the equity that you added that's reflected now in the new number and where that's largely sourced from? And then also, you have 16 origination platforms. And I believe historically, you guys have talked about rationalizing that footprint and reducing the number of platforms. So could you give us an update on those efforts and maybe updated expectations for how many platforms you expect and what impact that will have on the P&L?\nJames Zelter: Sure. This is Jim. I'll just go through some basic numbers and Martin can give some color as well. But the $62 billion is the origination number for the quarter. And it's really a vast majority of is the debt origination, mid- to high 50s is debt origination. And that's split on the debt side between the platforms and the core credit, that's a lion's share of that with also our high-grade capital solutions. Certainly, it's our view, the 16 platforms we've organized, and Chris Edson now is the person who runs our global origination business, we brought it all together. We have it run in 3 or 4 buckets where there's a rationalization of oversight, there's symmetry and risk and sourcing and analytics. And so we're not tied to the number. We did sell one in the past, and it really was a question of the size of the flow that we received versus the equity investment got out of balance. But for the most part, we're very, very happy with the 16 today. They're diverse in terms of product set. They're diverse in terms of regional and global coverage. They do have one similarity, senior-secured top-of-the-capital structure risk, the 4 biggest being ATLAS, MidCap, Redding Ridge and Wheels. So we're very focused on those 16 and don't see any more rationalization other than how we oversee and direct the business. And again, this is where the Apollo ecosystem and our historic private equity mentality, we bring that mentality, that oversight of centralized analytics to these capital markets and origination activities, and we've been very successful. The other areas, the core credit, large-cap originations, CLO, CRE are all going along. We do have a number north of 12 origination partnerships, only a couple of which are public. Obviously, namely Citi was quite a large name. And so from our perspective, the business is -- we feel we are a market leader. Following the nomenclature that's used by many of our peers in the conversations in these conference calls, it seems like there is a lot of renaissance and insight into this strategy. But we feel we are the market leader, and it's all about capturing that great yield on a risk-adjusted basis. So no big change in the strategy.\nMarc Rowan: So I'm going to just pick up on two tangents, the first on cost. Recall that these platforms are stand-alone entities. We generally -- we may start owning 100% of them, but we generally do not own 100% of the sizable platforms over time. We own them, as I suggested earlier, in partnership with institutional investors and in partnership, in some cases, with people who would view competitive peer insurance companies. There is no expense drip, if you will, from the platforms. The platforms bear their own expenses, and it's part of the ROE of a platform. And by the way, the ROEs on the platform are generally quite good. And they form a bulk of what is inside of AAA at this point in time. So you can see the synergy of how the business works together. The part we didn't talk about was equity, and I think it's interesting to talk about equity. Our 5-year plan envisions very substantial penetration of fixed income replacement. Recall, the 5-year plan calls for a doubling of the size of our credit business, which is already our largest business. But in contrast to our first 5-year plan, the second 5-year plan also forecasts that we will substantially grow our equity business, particularly in hybrid equity. Hybrid being not a hybrid like a bank hybrid, but hybrid being the midpoint between debt and equity. Think of it as lower risk, lower reward equity. Starting to measure that, holding the teams responsible for that is a key part of the way the business is run. And so putting it out there and having a report card with all of you that shows how we're doing, I believe to be very important. I thought the team did a very good job and presented a very compelling case for the growth of the equity franchise over a period of time, and it's a key plank in our strategy, and measuring is where it starts.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe just back on the origination at $62 billion, you're obviously annualized, that's almost $250 million and your goal is $275 million per annum over the next 5 years. So just wanted to get some context on where this level could go if there are any significant capacity constraints that would limit you from going materially higher than a $275 million run rate. And then as you distribute that, I think the template has been 25% third party, 50% Athene and 25% syndication. How might any kind of overage of -- if you exceed your goals on $275 million and as you think about the allocation through the different parts of that -- of those businesses, how might those change if the origination exceeds those goals?\nJames Zelter: Well, thank you. It's Jim. Since we're a broad 60 days into our 5-year plan, we're not going to adjust the number at this point in time. But I guess I'd give you a little -- let me give you a little bit more color on the business in terms of spread and scale and breadth. And I'd also -- before I get into that, like this is the whole -- the philosophy of the third-party business, the philosophy on syndication, open architecture, evergreen products. These all tie into the notion of expanding the footprint, expanding origination, having partnerships and wanting 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. This all is very consistent with that theme. I will give you a bit of color. What we have found year-to-date over the last 24 months is on the origination platforms, which have grown nicely and are a big contributor, that the actual spreads on the products that we're creating has stayed in that mid-300s, approaching 400 over on a spread basis. And the -- notwithstanding the volatility in the treasury market and the compression of spreads in public corporate credit, which has been very, very strong, over 150 basis points of compression spreads, spreads have tightened maybe 10 to 15 basis points out of the origination platform. So approximately 400 over to 385, 390. On the traditional credit platforms, we've had a bit more compression. If the public markets have compressed 150 basis points, we've got about 60, 70 basis points of compression in spread. And when you add that all up, we are -- we were in the 410 area about a year or so ago, we're like in the 375, 380 zip code today. So compelling scaled value proposition, which is really feeding all of our business. It's feeding ADS, it's feeding AAA, it's feeding ASPC, all the products and will so in the future. We're excited about the launch of ABC in terms of our asset-backed corporation. But again, I think it would be presumptive to expand that estimate of our scale, but I don't want to underestimate the impact of the flywheel of syndication of ACS, of global wealth, of third-party insurance, which it touches on all of those.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan Chase.\nKenneth Worthington: Rates have backed up subsequent to the end of the quarter. How does the move impact the hedges that you called out last quarter? And to what extent are you using the higher rates to engage to further fix your floating assets? And is the move that we've seen in rates enough to impact spreads as we think about 4Q?\nMartin Kelly: Our plan, I think as we were clear, is to maintain a net floating rate position around $15 billion. And so a move in rates won't change that hedge posture, certainly within the context of what we're seeing. And if you recall from the Investor Day, we had modeled our expectations that we'd have 6 rate cuts or the equivalent of 6 rate cuts in the estimates we provided 2 this year and another 4 before the end of next year. So that's looking more realistic today than I think it was back a month, 6 weeks ago. So Ken, no real change, we're just -- it's obviously a component of earnings. And we were pretty clear about extreme moves in rates on the up and the down and how that affects the blended growth of the business after core earnings growth. But no change to hedge posture or outlook.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ben Budish of Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I wanted to ask about the SRE guidance. If I just think back to last quarter, can you unpack a little bit what went sort of better than expected? When I look at least at Street numbers, it looked like your cost of funds came in a little lower than expected. And then thinking through to Q4, your full year guidance is unchanged. So thinking about what perhaps went better this quarter. Is there some sort of reversal expected or any kind of timing differences? How should we be thinking about those different factors?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. So we had a $20 billion quarter. So that's very strong, and that drove earnings. We also were able to invest at the margin. And sort of using the metrics that Jim just walked through, the spread that we are able to earn on assets at the margin was a bit better than we were expecting it to be. So it's really those 2 components. I mentioned that we expect Q4 to be more or less the same as Q3 in terms of SRE dollars, assuming 11% return on alts. That would get you to a 5% growth rate for the year like-for-like. We said 4% at the Investor Day. So it's sort of right on top of what we suggested. So no real change, it's just we had a larger quarter in top line growth and that pulled through to reported SRE.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: So just a follow-up on that question. So are the changes to the alternatives allocation for retirement services complete? I think you mentioned AAA now represents 8%. So therefore, getting to that 11% normalized return given AAA's performance, is that what we should be expecting going forward?\nMartin Kelly: Yes. The answer is yes, they are complete. So -- and I'll just provide some context around what the portfolio looks like today. So about 80% of the alts portfolio is represented by AAA. About 10% is represented by retirement services platforms that we retain, Athora principally and a small exposure to Venerable. The other platforms have all been repositioned or sold within the group in the third quarter. And the other 10% is other investments typically in hybrid type fund investments around the platform that we would expect would generate teens returns over time. So we have done the repositioning that's behind us. And we obviously believe that, that will help in getting to sustained sort of 11% -- circa 11% returns over time.\nOperator: Our final question today is coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I was hoping you could update us on the use of your sidecar vehicle ADIP. I recall in the past, you guys had talked about ADIP taking down about 40% to 45% or so of new funds over time. I think year-to-date, it's a bit less than that. Just curious if you could just update us on how you see that evolving over the next couple of years. What factors you consider in toggling ADIP's contribution higher? And then in what scenario might you increase the dividend out of Athene relative to your guide for the consistent $750 million a year of dividends?\nMartin Kelly: So we outlined that the SRE growth is governed by or driven by a couple of different components. Obviously, the underlying core growth in the business is one; rates, two; back book repositioning, three; and then the contribution of ADIP capital to taking down new business as the fourth. There are some choices in there that we can make, and we were pretty clear that within parameters that we've established, we can make choices to increase or decrease the participation that ADIP has over time. And that's relevant not just in aggregate, but it's also relevant at the product level. And so that's part of how we are able to achieve the earnings growth that we've outlined. I think over time, you should expect that the rate of participation will be consistent with that long-term average. So think sort of mid- to high 30s, 40% as an appropriate return -- percentage participation in business over time.\nMarc Rowan: Maybe I'll just close it out with just 2 additional thoughts. In terms of capital, as you know, we take roughly a $750 million a year dividend out of Athene. The forecast that we gave you does not have any real change in that because it is also tied to a substantial amount of growth in the retirement services business. And growth, as Martin suggested, can be organic growth in the business, or Athene always has a choice to own more of the business that it creates rather than giving it out to the sidecar, which is not done on a deal-by-deal basis, it's done over a long period of time and over a vintage. So it's not something you can change immediately. But you should assume, as Martin suggested, that the dividend out of Athene remains the same, absent a real falloff in business, which we do not expect. I do think it's worth a question on the sidecar. This is something that we've tried very hard to get -- to make a point on. The insurance business, the retirement services business is so attractive that we actually have clients who pay us to be in the business with us. Not only do they pay in the sidecar the same asset management fees that Athene pays, they also pay a fronting fee to Athene for putting the business on the books, and they pay a fee in terms of promote on the overall. And so the ability to put more than $6 billion into a sidecar reflects a belief that we will use this responsibly, and we will generate high rates of return on a responsible basis over a long period of time. If you do that, you get to raise a sidecar. If you don't do that, you are forced to build the business solely with your own capital to subsidize. That is a little bit of what we see going on in the industry today. And recall that capital regimes in the U.S. and Bermuda on the one hand and capital regimes in places like Cayman and the other are totally different. I do believe a word of caution in our industry. Anytime you hear people have gone to Cayman, you should just divide the capital by 2. I do not personally believe that is going to end well, and it's not where we intend or how we run the business. We want to do things on a long-term sustainable basis that provide good rates of return for people while having adequate capital in the business.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gunn for closing comments.\nNoah Gunn: Great. I'd just like to close by saying on behalf of our entire team, we really appreciate, again, all the time that you've given to us and focusing on our business between Investor Day and today's call. If you have any follow-up questions on anything we discuss, feel free to follow up with us directly, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. So third quarter financial results across FRE, SRE and PII exceeded expectations and position us well to close out 2024, consistent with our expectations and to move confidently into the first year of our latest 5-year plan. I'll make some very brief comments on this quarter's results before opening up to Q&A. Fee-related earnings. Within asset management, FRE reached a new quarterly record and surpassed $1.5 billion on a year-to-date basis, supported by strength in fee-related revenues from our credit business. Credit management fees increased 20% year-over-year, with growth in third-party credit management fees exceeding that of Athene and Athora. Over the last 12 months, we've generated more than $140 billion of inflows to support continued management fee growth. In the third quarter, credit inflows totaled $39 billion, inclusive of the robust flows of Athene that Marc mentioned as well as broad-based fundraising activity across direct lending, opportunistic and multicredit and further inflows related to financing our ATLAS business. Our Capital Solutions business posted its second highest quarter of fees on record, supported by approximately 80 underlying transactions. Fee-related performance fees were also strong, increasing more than 40% year-over-year. This fee stream has primarily driven by stable, spread-based income from certain credit products and vehicles including ADS. Going into the fourth quarter, we expect these revenue growth trends to largely persist, supported by our previously discussed organic capital formation target of $120 million for full year 2024, and a strong, diversified origination pipeline. At the same time, we've remained focused on cost discipline, with total expenses increasing 11% year-to-date versus the prior 9-month period, excluding the impact of $15 million of fund merger costs in the second quarter that we previously commented on. Turning to retirement services. SRE results reflect robust organic growth trends of $20 billion in the quarter and solid levels of spread profitability. Net spread, excluding notable items, increased by 16 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and was roughly flat with Q2 when adjusting for our long-term expectations of an 11% alternatives return. As part of this, Athene's alternatives portfolio generated an 8.2% annualized return in the third quarter, within which AAA generated a 10.5% annualized return, approaching the 11% long-term expectation. We took several actions with respect to Athene's alternatives portfolio within Q3 to align the allocation more closely with AAA, which now accounts for approximately 80% of the portfolio at quarter end. Starting in January and going forward, we intend to pre-release return information around the first business day following quarter end in an effort to provide more near-term visibility into this line item. Turning to the year-to-date view. SRE totaled $2.4 billion, up 5% versus the prior year comparable period when excluding notable items. As we described in detail at Investor Day, we expect SRE to approximate $3.2 billion for the full year, which implies a similar level of SRE in the fourth quarter versus third quarter results on an as-reported basis. Principal investing income benefited from some monetizations by Fund IX during the quarter. Our net accrued performance fee balance at September 30 was $1.4 billion and continues to be supported by strong investment performance. We generated double-digit returns across a variety of credit strategies and hybrid value over the last 12 months, as well as more than 30% for PE Fund X over the same period. While we expect near-term realizations activity to be more in line with recent quarterly trends based on our current pipeline, we're optimistic that PII will increase meaningfully over the next couple of years as the exit environment improves. In terms of capital allocation, we deployed more than $400 million within Q3 to opportunistically repurchase more than 4 million shares at an average price of $105 amid heightened volatility during the quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. It's high up the list. We plan to. I would say I'm not aware of anyone else in the industry that publishes this information. And so it's another area where we strive to be transparent. And we track very closely against the metric. And as Marc said, the ups and downs from any one quarter to the next tend to be driven by contractual features or policies, and so they're highly predictable. Looking ahead, I wouldn't expect any different trend from what we're seeing. It's just tracking exactly as we expect. Patrick, it's Martin. So we're not seeing that headwind. I would say if you look at how retail product is distributed, in whatever -- through whatever channel, there is a reasonably large segment of the distribution, which incurs no cost. So think family office, we cover family office ourselves. There's no sort of external cost to distribute that product. And there are a couple of other channels which are similar. Within the channels that we do incur a cost, the cost can come in 1 of 2 forms. It can be either a trailer against revenues, which is just netted against the revenue line or it can be an upfront placement fee, and that's expensed as it's incurred. And we're still early days in this whole evolution. But what we're seeing is a migration of the costs from upfront fees to trailer fees. And I think that reflects the quality of the product and the stickiness of the product. But you'll see within -- all of this is contemplated in the plan that we've laid out. We don't expect to see margin degradation from it. And I think you'll see a majority of the costs over time will be netted against revenues versus an explicit non-comp cost. So hopefully, that helps put the pieces together. Our plan, I think as we were clear, is to maintain a net floating rate position around $15 billion. And so a move in rates won't change that hedge posture, certainly within the context of what we're seeing. And if you recall from the Investor Day, we had modeled our expectations that we'd have 6 rate cuts or the equivalent of 6 rate cuts in the estimates we provided 2 this year and another 4 before the end of next year. So that's looking more realistic today than I think it was back a month, 6 weeks ago. So Ken, no real change, we're just -- it's obviously a component of earnings. And we were pretty clear about extreme moves in rates on the up and the down and how that affects the blended growth of the business after core earnings growth. But no change to hedge posture or outlook. Yes. So we had a $20 billion quarter. So that's very strong, and that drove earnings. We also were able to invest at the margin. And sort of using the metrics that Jim just walked through, the spread that we are able to earn on assets at the margin was a bit better than we were expecting it to be. So it's really those 2 components. I mentioned that we expect Q4 to be more or less the same as Q3 in terms of SRE dollars, assuming 11% return on alts. That would get you to a 5% growth rate for the year like-for-like. We said 4% at the Investor Day. So it's sort of right on top of what we suggested. So no real change, it's just we had a larger quarter in top line growth and that pulled through to reported SRE. Yes. The answer is yes, they are complete. So -- and I'll just provide some context around what the portfolio looks like today. So about 80% of the alts portfolio is represented by AAA. About 10% is represented by retirement services platforms that we retain, Athora principally and a small exposure to Venerable.

So think sort of mid- to high 30s, 40% as an appropriate return -- percentage participation in business over time."

            "name": "James Zelter",
            "content": "Yes. Not a lot to add, Alex, but I would say that what Marc has described is this open architecture flywheel. And whether it's in funds, whether it's in ADIP, whether it's sharing views on how CLO should be looked at and calculated from a regulatory perspective, there's a whole variety of activity that takes place. And we have always been a player in this space. But as Marc mentioned, by putting  one of our senior individuals who has really been at the intersection of the Athene portfolio leadership, applying that same insight, sourcing, portfolio, construction across the environment is helpful. And again, this is mostly investment-grade activity. And the reason why we think it can grow so large is, for the most part, all this activity, if you get into investment grade and fixed income replacement, this is really dispersion of credit risk across the platform and across the ecosystem, not just the creation, which is really more the traditional direct origination. So the scale and substance of these activities, we think is -- we're still in the early days. Yes. And what Marc is really talking about is taking a product dialogue and making it much more of a portfolio solutions dialogue. And we're at the head of the pack in terms of the breadth of products that we've created. As Marc said, the clients don't want -- they don't want binary outcomes, they want a lot more evergreen products. But the latest note that Marc mentioned, whether it's -- certainly, in the equity business, in the public equity business, the ability to buy things on margin. Well, certainly, there will be a time in the future where whether it's fund finance or other or even portfolio solutions in terms of SAA, strategic asset allocation, how a client looks at a variety of these options. So it's much more holistic. There will be a few winners. We plan -- we have planted our flag with resources and commitment and vision to be a successful player. Sure. This is Jim. I'll just go through some basic numbers and Martin can give some color as well. But the $62 billion is the origination number for the quarter. And it's really a vast majority of is the debt origination, mid- to high 50s is debt origination. And that's split on the debt side between the platforms and the core credit, that's a lion's share of that with also our high-grade capital solutions. Certainly, it's our view, the 16 platforms we've organized, and Chris Edson now is the person who runs our global origination business, we brought it all together. We have it run in 3 or 4 buckets where there's a rationalization of oversight, there's symmetry and risk and sourcing and analytics. And so we're not tied to the number. We did sell one in the past, and it really was a question of the size of the flow that we received versus the equity investment got out of balance. But for the most part, we're very, very happy with the 16 today. They're diverse in terms of product set. They're diverse in terms of regional and global coverage. They do have one similarity, senior-secured top-of-the-capital structure risk, the 4 biggest being ATLAS, MidCap, Redding Ridge and Wheels. So we're very focused on those 16 and don't see any more rationalization other than how we oversee and direct the business. And again, this is where the Apollo ecosystem and our historic private equity mentality, we bring that mentality, that oversight of centralized analytics to these capital markets and origination activities, and we've been very successful. The other areas, the core credit, large-cap originations, CLO, CRE are all going along. We do have a number north of 12 origination partnerships, only a couple of which are public. Obviously, namely Citi was quite a large name. And so from our perspective, the business is -- we feel we are a market leader. Following the nomenclature that's used by many of our peers in the conversations in these conference calls, it seems like there is a lot of renaissance and insight into this strategy. But we feel we are the market leader, and it's all about capturing that great yield on a risk-adjusted basis. So no big change in the strategy. Well, thank you. It's Jim. Since we're a broad 60 days into our 5-year plan, we're not going to adjust the number at this point in time. But I guess I'd give you a little -- let me give you a little bit more color on the business in terms of spread and scale and breadth. And I'd also -- before I get into that, like this is the whole -- the philosophy of the third-party business, the philosophy on syndication, open architecture, evergreen products.

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah, and good morning. I want to echo Noah's sentiment that we take nothing for granted, and we deeply appreciate your willingness to spend 3 to 4 hours with us on Investor Day to truly dig into the unique business that we are building. Hopefully, we outlined a clear vision for our 5-year plan as well as the upside drivers. In summary, for those who did not suffer through the 3 to 4 hours, we talked about average annual FRE growth of 20% and average annual SRE growth of 10%, FRE and SRE reaching $10 billion, $5 billion each in 2029 and ANI more than doubling to $15 a share by 2029. Capital generation of $21 billion. In short, we laid out ambitious targets, but they're targets the management team and I are fully behind and believe we can meet. Third quarter was a solid start in that direction. In short, everything worked. The team made all of us look good. We will open the frozen yogurt bar today to reward the team for that. It's one of the tools we joked about on Investor Day, but it's part of the culture of Apollo. Let me spend a second as to how the long-term business plan in the quarter relate to each other. In terms of our 5-year plan, we laid out 4 mega trends or tailwinds we thought were going to drive ourselves on our industry forward over the next 5 years: The so-called global industrial renaissance and this massive need for capital to rebuild infrastructure, energy transition and next-gen power and data; the second, retirement; the third is the growth of individuals, complementing institutions who have long been the sole source of capital for private assets; and finally, the notion of public and private convergence. In short, any of these 4 TAMs could double our business over the next 5 years. It is up to us to execute against this opportunity set and to position the franchise squarely in front of these very strong tailwinds. We are fortunate in many ways that even at our size and scale, in the scheme of the asset management industry, we are a relatively small player. And while we project that we will double our business over the next 5 years, that is not all that large, particularly compared to the enormous TAMs in front of us. Bringing it down to the quarter, in terms of global industrial renaissance and the massive need for capital, this was a record origination quarter, $62 billion of originations for the quarter, $194 billion year-to-date. Platforms, really strong quarter. ATLAS, in particular, had a really strong quarter, $50 billion of cumulative origination to date, $5 billion of equity capital raised, a new $5 billion facility from BNP, 350-person strong. In short, the cylinders are all firing at ATLAS, and we expect great things from them going forward. In retirement, Athene had another $20 billion organic growth quarter. We continue to widen the funnel through distribution expansion. Just launched with BAML last week, another top 15 platform. Away from Athene, we continue to make inroads into the retirement space, in particular, in the DC market. We have our first mandate for our AAA product on an RIA platform. We are in the equity sleeve of a CIT offering, and we launched in October. While technical, this is an enormous milestone for us and I believe portends well for the future in front of us in adding private assets to help bulk and accelerate retirement solutions for those in need. In terms of individual investors in progress against retail, fundraising is on pace to increase 50% year-over-year in '24 without a flagship fund. The team here has done an extraordinary job. ABC, our asset-based company, is now distributing on 2 large wire house platforms. ASPM, our evergreen multi-asset secondary strategy, launched globally. We now have, post these 2, 11 wealth products focused on the market, 6 of which have been in the market for a year or less. But I want to really call out here what the potential of what this can be. Recall that our strategy here is to be seen as an innovator in this marketplace. So AAA, which we talked about 1.5 years ago, we've now crossed $18.5 billion and we expect to be circa $20 billion by year-end. Strong returns here, now approximately 10.5%, with a fraction of the volatility of public equity markets and public debt markets. This is the kind of product that has multiple uses across portfolios. And I stick by what I said when we launched the product, I expect this to be the largest fund at Apollo within a very short period of time. And I think next year will be when that happens. ADS, also really strong performance. Durable yield, taking advantage of trends in private credit, but done in an Apollo-esque way, lowest leverage, all first lean. We expect the strategy to be circa $15 billion at year-end. I cite the size of this because I think it's important to show just how fast this channel is developing. And the channel development is about product, it is about performance, but it's also about the capability to serve this large and growing market and the capability to continue to innovate. We learn something almost every day in this marketplace. To cite just one example, we talked a year ago about an insurance-wrapped product to take advantage of the unique tax situation of individual investors. Our Altitude series, which encompasses our insurance-wrapped product, we expect to be circa $1 billion at year-end and now active in 2 significant wire houses. Those 3 trends, global industrial renaissance, retirement and growth in the retail channel are 3 of the 4 cylinders that we expect or 3 of the 4 tailwinds that we expect to power our business going forward. The fourth is this whole notion of public and private convergence. We see this as fixed income replacement. What we're watching take place is investors who have historically allocated to private markets solely out of their alternative bucket, are beginning to allocate out of their fixed income bucket, which historically, has been 100% public investment grade. We expect that over time, investors will begin to divide this bucket between beta, public investment grade; and alpha, private investment grade. And they will consume that in a number of different formats. Some will consume directly as pure private assets, some will consume it in fund format, and yet others will consume it in products that are more familiar to them from more familiar names, such as the partnerships and the relationships we've announced with Lord Abbett. and with State Street. More on that product when it is approved because it is currently in registration. Those 4 tailwinds, I believe, will push our business forward and they will push our industry forward. But all of them ultimately depend on one factor. They depend on our capacity to originate assets that offer excess return per unit of risk or alpha. We are not solely an asset manager. If we behave like an asset manager and simply gather funds, we will simply degrade our business and degrade our franchise. That is not our intention, and that is not what we're going to do. Our capacity to grow is limited, as I've said previously, by our ability to originate, and we are keenly focused on how we go about doing this. We have a number of platforms, some 16, which we've spent roughly $8 billion building over the past 15 years that now employs circa 4,000 people. This is a very significant investment and a bar that many of our competitors will need to cross to compete with us in this area. Some will do that, and we expect them to do that. But make no mistake, this market is enormous, but one has to originate good risk to be able to grow their business and offer their clients excess return per unit of risk. In the 3.5 hours that we talked during our Investor Day, I wish we could have covered everything, but we failed to. One area I really want to drive home and talk about our recent promotion is our third-party insurance. We have built, for Athene, the capacity to originate good assets and have proven over the past 15 years that we can scale our retirement services business. Recall that as an originator of assets, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. In some ways, the ideal partners for us are other insurers, people who are trying to amortize the same sorts of liabilities that we're seeking to amortize and deal with the same capital and regulatory regimes. Our third-party insurance business is approximately $100 billion of AUM as of this date, and we expect it to double over the next 5 years. But it will not double on its own. And so we've taken one of our most senior partners, Jeff Jacobs, and asked Jeff to become the CEO of our third-party insurance business with all of the resources of the firm at his disposal. This is important to us not just in the capacity to add AUM, but also to support an industry and to support retirement and to make sure that there's a broad understanding of the regulatory and capital regimes associated with private assets, particularly private investment grade, and it's an area that will receive lots of attention from us. In short, we're playing to win. Lots of the terms we've used across the industry, this notion of origination, fixed income replacement and an industrial renaissance now seem to be mainstream. We believe we are building something unique in the context of our industry, and we believe we are uniquely positioned for this opportunity, with the capacity to originate the right cost and form of capital and the right culture to succeed. In short, we get to do this. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin. So I'm going to -- it's Marc, Alex. I'm going to start more generally, and then Jim will pick up specifically. A bunch of the things you've said really don't track with how things have done. We have always started and always run a third-party business. People who you would think would be -- who are our competitors in the liability, we partner with on the asset side regularly. Not only do we partner with them in an aligned fashion for the assets themselves, but you know from our public announcements that a number of people you would consider our direct competitors own pro rata side-by-side pieces of our origination platform. We intend to continue to do this going forward. Unlike certain very constrained markets, for instance, like private equity, the market for private investment grade, I believe, to be vast. And this is about having the capital to go after them. And also recall that we -- although we originate a risk, we want some of that risk for the Athene balance sheet. We want some of that risk for our credit funds and the other accounts that we manage on behalf of our third-party clients. At this point in time and for the foreseeable future, having like-minded institutions, particularly insurers who have the same risk reward and the same regulatory and the same capital regimes is additive to our franchise and it's additive to their franchise. Competitively, we still take a very, very large share of these assets and no one competitor has anything near it. And we -- but we view this as beneficial to our franchise. And in turn, if one of our peer insurance companies originates risk that we think is interesting and they want us to participate with them, we will. It's a very different ecosystem than people have historically thought of in the private equity area, where it's a winner-take-all mentality. I sometimes joke in credit that if you originate a risk and own 100% of it, it means you made a mistake rather than you won something. The second part before I turn to Jim, is we have 2 or 3 different types of insurance accounting. By the way, they're mostly life and annuity, not PNC, just to touch on that. Some of third-party insurance are direct placements with peer insurance companies, either through programmatic investments, one-off investments or in the context of funds or SMAs, a very big part of our business. But increasingly, we actually see people partnering with us, institutions and, in some cases, other financial institutions, side-by-side with us in ADIP. ADIP gives participants not just a share of the assets, but a share of the liabilities, and they get to leverage off the Athene cost structure. Although we didn't talk about it this quarter, when you have a chance to go back, Athene continues to do an unbelievable job on the efficiency operations. I saw some numbers from the quarter. I, quite frankly, was impressed. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim. It's Marc for one second. So during the substantial run-up in interest rates, there was a tremendous amount of interest from the research community and from shareholders into the behavior of liabilities. And so we began to publish the statistics that we used actually to run our business. The runoff of insurance liabilities is actually highly predictable. And one of the things we wanted to do by publishing is to show that we actually have a pretty good sense of when period-end business, MYGA business is going to run off. We have a regular flow of pension risk transfer business and a regular flow of runoff of fixed income annuities as well as policy loans and other out-of-period surrenders. I think the easiest thing to do is probably update our '25 forecast. But with Investor Day, we didn't get around to it. I think that's -- it's on our to-do list. So I'm tempted to answer your retail question with a retirement answer, but I'm actually going to go after the retail side of it. So we're in the very early stages. I think one of the things we tried to do at Investor Day was to present this pyramid of how we think about the retail channel. At the top of the pyramid, we think about family office. Family office to us is really nothing other than institutional. We cover them like institutions. They behave like institutions. As best we can tell, they are now close to 50% private, which does not mean alternative, but -- in a traditional sense, but 50% private. At the bottom of the pyramid, I call that mass affluent, I hypothesize that we were not likely to serve these people directly, that we were likely to be a parts provider to incumbent asset managers, traditional asset managers who were going to blend in a number of different formats, private assets into products that are more easily understood by the vast majority of investors who will not on their own, go through the educational process and perhaps are not closely advised by a financial adviser. The channel that we -- I think you're referencing is really talking about the advice channel, which let's call that high net worth, which has lots of different definitions. For us, I think that this is a question of appropriate products and services. They generally do not buy products that have binary outcomes. They buy things that are more yield-oriented that tend to pull to par or have more predictable behavior, although episodically, they do buy traditional alternative products in fund format, but that is not the vast majority of what we're talking about. If you think about these institutions, serving these institutions is going to be, in my opinion, an opportunity for a handful of firms. The scale that one needs to put together of people, technology, products, systems to serve one of the large wealth channel participants really only makes sense if you are multiple products at a large scale and are capable of generating alpha. Let's not forget that at the end of the day, we're not just an asset manager, we have to develop excess return. For better or worse, I think we envisioned the cost of doing this. I don't view the cost as a surprise. They've been contemplated in the context of the budgets and forecast we've given you. So I would not call out anything unique. I think the interesting thing that's happening in this business is when we enter a certain channel, we say, \"Oh, we're partnered with so and so.\" The reality is we're still selling to 5% or 10% of their financial advisers and their clients, we have -- we, all of us, have yet to fully penetrate any of these systems. To fully penetrate a system, we have to make our products simpler. We have to be able to serve qualified and nonqualified investors. And we have to be able to do it with technological ease. And so we are not so much seeing cost pressure. What we're seeing is requests for services. This can be educational services. This can be technological services. This can be ease of doing business services. And perhaps one of the most intriguing, something we've referred to previously is the addition of regular way, low-cost leverage. And with that, I'll turn it to Jim to see if he wants to add anything. So I'll start by saying that I did point it out, but it is not something we've budgeted in our plan or to get to our 5-year plan. But I think we have to just look around the world for solutions, and I did mention at Investor Day. In places in the world where private assets, and I'm not talking about alternate, but private assets have been added to portfolios, societies have gotten superior outcomes. Australia is probably the most visible place where superannuation has achieved very, very successful returns for retirees in Australia. And one can demonstrate that if you look at the inclusion of private assets along with traditional assets in a blend, we're talking about outcomes that are not slightly better, we're talking about 40% to 60% better outcomes. Over time, I believe people will see the light, and we will eventually have the inclusion of private assets in what would be traditionally public-only portfolios. Right now, recordkeeping, rule of law or practice, really, have kept significant allocations out of that for the time being to the detriment, I believe, of the participants in these plans. But the retirement opportunity is not just about the $12 trillion to $13 trillion of 401(k) and having a slice of that participate in private assets, it is also about rethinking retirement more generally. If I look at our 15 years so far at Athene, I have to really commend the team. They have done an incredible job. They took a start-up, and they turned it into the largest organic originator of retirement products in the U.S. and I believe, in the world. And they do it really efficiently. they do it really well, and they earn very nice rates of return. But if we're honest, what they've done is they have taken a traditional product set that has not really been updated all that much over the past 15 years, and they've just done a better job, and they've offered consumers a piece of the private market's alpha to create better outcomes, and it turns out consumers prefer more to less. I believe there is an opportunity to rethink the product set itself. And we had a little discussion at Investor Day, the notion of simplification and getting to guaranteed lifetime income, I believe, to be the North Star for where we would like to go. Whether we get all the way there in a simple product that offers guaranteed lifetime income, we had a little back and forth at Investor Day, but that is what we're pursuing. But this notion of rethinking the product set, I believe to be the single biggest opportunity in front of us, and that is what is baked into our 5-year plan over the next few years. Should we get access to 401(k) through broad-based reform or regulatory change or regulatory encouragement? I believe that would be upside, not just for us, but for the entire industry, limited, of course, by all of our capacity to originate. At the end of the day, this comes back to origination. So I'll start in reverse. So AAA today is circa $18.5 billion. We expect it to be circa $20 billion at year-end. It is broadly -- it's an equity product, but it is a hybrid type equity, meaning it has lower volatility than traditional equities. And its notion is to produce low double-digit rates of return with much less volatility than public equities. Recall that public equities over a long period of time with volatility offer 9% to 10%. So the use case here is in part equity replacement and in part, risk reduction through hybrid without yet moving to fixed income and lower rates of return. We are seeing it adopted in portfolio allocation. Right now, it is still being purchased as a product. Someone comes and subscribes to AAA because they want to be in AAA. But I do envision a day when we will be talking about 60-40 portfolios that are comprised of public and private. I do think the future of the retail business will in part be portfolio solutions. In the retirement space, in this first CIT, that is essentially what is happening. It is an equity -- it's part of the equity sleeve that is the default offering for equity for this group and plan of retirees. Pipeline, I believe, would overstate the progress to date. I am very happy to see the first and first couple of individuals and firms who are beginning to look at this as part of an overall solution. And let us do a good job doing this, and we'll grow from there. But too early to say pipeline. I'll add a little bit to it. And this is a part of a broader outlook. I mean part of what is implicit in the discussion that we've been having of origination is that we expect private assets to be -- have lots of demand and to be in shorter supply. If we're right about that, we would expect fees to be stable over a long period of time, unless there is something unexpected that happens in the industry. We've built this entire business, our industry, out of the smallest bucket of our institutional clients called alternatives. All of a sudden, we have 3 new sources of demand for private assets. Retirement is full swing into private assets. Insurance companies and others have been for a long period of time, and you're seeing them broaden out what they do. The second is individuals, individuals both through the retail channels that you've been talking about, but also through the convergence of public and private, the inclusion of private assets in public products. So we see that as really interesting growth to what's happening. And then we see our institutions who historically have only invested in private assets out of their alternative business beginning to invest in private assets out of their much larger and heretofore untapped fixed income bucket. If we're right, we expect there to be significant demand for private assets, and the supply of private assets is not the same as the supply for an asset manager. It is up to each of the firms in their respective areas and where they have expertise to generate these assets that offer excess return per unit of risk. That's after all the promise of private markets. So I'm going to just pick up on two tangents, the first on cost. Recall that these platforms are stand-alone entities. We generally -- we may start owning 100% of them, but we generally do not own 100% of the sizable platforms over time. We own them, as I suggested earlier, in partnership with institutional investors and in partnership, in some cases, with people who would view competitive peer insurance companies. There is no expense drip, if you will, from the platforms. The platforms bear their own expenses, and it's part of the ROE of a platform. And by the way, the ROEs on the platform are generally quite good. And they form a bulk of what is inside of AAA at this point in time. So you can see the synergy of how the business works together. The part we didn't talk about was equity, and I think it's interesting to talk about equity. Our 5-year plan envisions very substantial penetration of fixed income replacement. Recall, the 5-year plan calls for a doubling of the size of our credit business, which is already our largest business. But in contrast to our first 5-year plan, the second 5-year plan also forecasts that we will substantially grow our equity business, particularly in hybrid equity. Hybrid being not a hybrid like a bank hybrid, but hybrid being the midpoint between debt and equity. Think of it as lower risk, lower reward equity. Starting to measure that, holding the teams responsible for that is a key part of the way the business is run. And so putting it out there and having a report card with all of you that shows how we're doing, I believe to be very important. I thought the team did a very good job and presented a very compelling case for the growth of the equity franchise over a period of time, and it's a key plank in our strategy, and measuring is where it starts. Maybe I'll just close it out with just 2 additional thoughts. In terms of capital, as you know, we take roughly a $750 million a year dividend out of Athene. The forecast that we gave you does not have any real change in that because it is also tied to a substantial amount of growth in the retirement services business. And growth, as Martin suggested, can be organic growth in the business, or Athene always has a choice to own more of the business that it creates rather than giving it out to the sidecar, which is not done on a deal-by-deal basis, it's done over a long period of time and over a vintage. So it's not something you can change immediately. But you should assume, as Martin suggested, that the dividend out of Athene remains the same, absent a real falloff in business, which we do not expect. I do think it's worth a question on the sidecar. This is something that we've tried very hard to get -- to make a point on. The insurance business, the retirement services business is so attractive that we actually have clients who pay us to be in the business with us. Not only do they pay in the sidecar the same asset management fees that Athene pays, they also pay a fronting fee to Athene for putting the business on the books, and they pay a fee in terms of promote on the overall. And so the ability to put more than $6 billion into a sidecar reflects a belief that we will use this responsibly, and we will generate high rates of return on a responsible basis over a long period of time. If you do that, you get to raise a sidecar. If you don't do that, you are forced to build the business solely with your own capital to subsidize. That is a little bit of what we see going on in the industry today. And recall that capital regimes in the U.S. and Bermuda on the one hand and capital regimes in places like Cayman and the other are totally different. I do believe a word of caution in our industry. Anytime you hear people have gone to Cayman, you should just divide the capital by 2. I do not personally believe that is going to end well, and it's not where we intend or how we run the business. We want to do things on a long-term sustainable basis that provide good rates of return for people while having adequate capital in the business."

During today\u2019s discussion, all callers will be placed in listen-only mode, and following management\u2019s prepared remarks, the conference call will be open for questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then rejoin the queue. This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performances. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP measures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation for an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. I will now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nNoah Gunn: Thanks operator. And welcome again everyone to our call. We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss all the momentum we are seeing across the firm. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. We reported solid second quarter financial results, which included record quarterly FRE of $516 million or $0.84 per share and SRE of $710 million or $1.15 per share. Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion or $1.64 per share. Joining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. Before handing it over, I'd like to formally announce that we are hosting an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, October 1st. We will provide additional detail in the coming months and hope that you will join our broader team as we discuss the exciting long-term growth opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll hand the call over to Marc.\nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. Happy summer. Those in New York certainly know what I\u2019m talking about. This quarter was a good reminder that great companies are built by honoring the fundamental promise they have made to their clients. In our industry, alternative assets. The fundamental promise that we make to our clients is excess return per unit of risk. Absent that, I\u2019m not sure why we as an industry would exist. This promise, the delivery of this promise was on full display across the entirety of our franchise for the quarter, through a private equity and hybrid and in our credit franchise. Just a quick tour of the quarter. In private equity we announced three transactions in the past 30 days. Travel Corp, Everi and IGT Gaming, truly an amazing stat. The team is working round the clock. If you think about the last decade of our private equity franchise which is in compass by funds 9 and 10. $45 billion of capital, $13 billion already realized. In Fund [ph] 9 as of the end of the quarter, 29 gross 20 net. In Fund 10, 47 gross and 20 net. Notwithstanding head wins across the private equity industry by people who perhaps trade from a fundamental promise. The team is doing an unbelievable job. In hybrid or equity that is private, something we\u2019ll talk more about on investor day. AAA, which is our flagship vehicle returned 10% over the last 12 months with on-track quarterly results. We now have positive returns in AAA 16 quarters in a row. To give you a longer-term perspective of why investors like hybrid, we've had two down quarters over the past 38. In a market characterized by volatility, by indexation and correlation, by key bets on very high-flying companies, the notion that you can achieve double-digit rates of return in the equity market and still have downside protection and reduce volatility is incredibly attractive to investors across the entire spectrum, from retirees to those seeking to accumulate. We have 17 billion of NAV now in our AAA vehicle, and as I've suggested, I expect this will be our largest fund over a period of time. Credit, which is the largest of our franchise, also had an amazing quarter. We were early in credit, and we have built a leading and a differentiated franchise. Recall that the differentiation of our franchise is a unique focus on investment grade, private investment grade to be specific. To give you just some of the performance stats for our major vehicles for the quarter, our total return fund up nearly 2% for the quarter, 10% latest 12 months. Structured credit and ABS, 2% for the quarter, 15% for the latest 12 months. ADS, our direct lending vehicle, private market BDC, if you will, up 3.4% for the quarter, 17% latest 12 months. Direct origination, 3.8% for the quarter, 19% for latest 12 months. Across the entirety of the franchise, equity, hybrid, and credit, this was an awesome quarter. I start with performance because ultimately the reward for good performance is more work. In our case, more work is inflows. We had record inflows for the quarter for a non-PE franchise year of $39 billion. Institutional was $16 billion, global wealth, $4 billion, up 50% versus the first quarter, and Athene had organic inflows of $17 billion. It was truly a great quarter across asset management. Asset management is generally better fitting from tailwinds. What we're seeing in our business is not the result of a quarterly spike or peak. We're seeing a fundamental shift in the marketplace, and it is happening across the entirety of our franchise. If you step back and think about what the big drivers are, certainly the big driver in credit, we are looking at three really interesting trends. Think of the places that capital is needed in our economy over the next decade. We are going to spend an awful lot of money on next generation of infrastructure for data centers and AI. We are going to spend an equal amount of money for energy transition, and we are going to spend a lot of money on what I'll call normal infrastructure. All three of those things are long dated. Many of them are structured. Many of them are complex. These are the kinds of things that are not well suited for institutions who are funded short. These are exactly the kinds of transactions in the investment grade market that we expect to drive our business and are driving our business. The way we look at the driver of our business, certainly in credit, is by originations. Recall that we have a $125 billion target for this year for originations. We originated $52 billion in the quarter, including $11 billion from Intel alone. We are quickly approaching the $150 billion target that we set for 2026, and the team is unhappy to hear this because they know I'm going to revise the number up. Just to give you a sense for how strong the trends are, year-to-date we've deployed $17 billion in next generation infrastructure alone. I expect this not to be a one or two quarter blip. I expect this to drive our business over the next decade against the backdrop of regulatory change, against the backdrop of government borrowing, and all the other trends that we know are happening in fixed income. Origination also drives for us capital solutions. Capital solutions, fees, and revenues are the byproduct of a successful origination franchise. Fee revenue totaled more than $200 million. We are on pace for a record year. Our pipeline is as strong as it has ever been, and we will continue to build out the business both by industry and by geography, including major advances in Australia and in Asia because the need for originated high quality investment grade assets with spread is global. Let me turn now to Athene and Retirement Services. Retirement Services is now in its 15th year. We've basically grown our earnings over 15 years at 15%, including 26% last year. Just like in asset management, good performance is ultimately rewarded with more capital. In Athene\u2019s case, this is the ability to attract strategic investors to support Athene through its sidecar, which we call ADIP. ADIP is the capital engine that helps Athene scale its business and run a truly efficient franchise. ADIP II has now closed and raised $6 billion, almost twice as much as ADIP I. As far as we know, this is the largest third-party capital sidecar in the retirement services industry. For the quarter, Athene hit every operating metric. New business volumes, underwritten returns, credit quality, expenses, surrenders, capital. Profitability for the quarter was impacted by the roll-off of exceptionally profitable business, which was put on during the peak of COVID. That same roll-off of business will also occur in the next quarter. Also during the quarter, the disagreement over the direction of interest rates toward the beginning of the quarter provided us opportunities to do additional hedging, which we did for the quarter. The roll-off of this business and hedging essentially cost us growth for the quarter and will cost us growth for Q3. We expect by Q4 the business to grow and to be back on trend, the result being that we will achieve in our estimation mid-single-digits SRE growth for the year, accounting for the two lost quarters, and we will return to trend double-digit growth next year. Martin will detail further and will dissect the pieces of this business, which I know are of interest to many of you. Athene is on track for 70 billion of organic inflows for the year. When I step back, we are simply fortunate to have delivered on our core promise to customers and to be in a market and in an industry that is driven by long-term to tailwinds. We have essentially four tailwinds in front of us. The first I've already detailed, which is this voracious need for capital, most of which we believe to be investment grade. That will drive our fixed-income franchise, fixed-income replacement. The second, retirement is a fact of life. We are all getting older. We have so far over the first 15 years at Athene, one, by producing incredibly good returns not just for investors but for customers, but essentially what we have done is we have modernized existing products. The opportunity now exists for the entire next generation of products to serve retirees, whether they are in the traditional insurance sector or they are in the vast pool of 401-K, which here to four has been off limits to most alternative assets providers. The third, our entire industry over a 40-year period has been built out of a small bucket of the institutional marketplace. We are watching an individual marketplace, led by family offices and high-network individuals that I believe will grow to be the size of the institutional market over time. Finally, and a notion that we will spend lots of time on in investor day, we are watching investors fundamentally rethink the difference between public and private. We grew up thinking that private was risky and that public was safe, and that probably was true 40 years ago. Private represented three products, private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, and public diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. What if our fundamental premise is wrong? What if private is both safe and risky and public is both safe and risky? The entire basis on which we have constructed portfolio allocation will need to be rethought. I don't have to guess at this. This is already happening in the fixed income bucket of our large institutional clients who are making daily trade-offs between public investment grade and private investment grade. It is happening in fixed income first because there are helpful gatekeepers or signposts called rating agencies who help investors discern quality between public and private markets. It is also helped by that there is not real liquidity in public fixed income markets, so the trade-off of liquidity is not that immense. The opportunity in front of us over the next few years is fixed income replacement, which will provide a turbo charge to an otherwise healthy business. But make no mistake, replacement is coming for the equity business as well. We will end up with a portion of public equity that decides that equity can be private as well. And we will have access to other parts of our institutional investor\u2019s allocation. We look forward to seeing you at investor day. And it certainly has been an active summer. And with that, I will turn it over to Scott.\nScott Kleinman: Thanks. And as Marc touched on, each of our core business drivers, deployment, investment performance and capital formation, were strong in the second quarter and highlight that momentum across Apollo is building. As we've discussed, our current five-year plan is underpinned by three strategic growth pillars, including origination, global wealth and capital solutions, all of which are tracking ahead of our 2026 targets and fueling growth in our franchise and our earnings power. On the investing front, gross capital deployment surged to a record $70 billion in the second quarter. The driving force of this strong investing activity was debt origination, complemented by deployment in hybrid and equity strategies. Record debt origination in the second quarter was driven by broad-based strength across all three forms of origination, traditional, platforms and record levels of high-grade corporate solutions activity. Combined with the strong first quarter, debt origination volume in the first half of the year was close to the total amount originated for all of 2023, highlighting the increasing scale of our ecosystem. We expect momentum in overall deployment activity to persist given the line of sight we have to robust transaction pipelines in both our equity and debt-focused businesses. As a result of the higher interest rate backdrop and structural changes in traditional financing markets, we're seeing a lot of demand for customized, long-dated solutions that utilize debt capital, equity capital, or a combination of both. We believe we're uniquely positioned to meet this need by accessing our lower-cost, scaled long-duration capital within Athene and elsewhere, coupled with our flexible investment approach that aims to maximize risk return across the capital structure. Within second quarter activity, the Intel transaction Marc explained earlier is a prime example of how we combine these powerful advantages to serve clients in a differentiated way. Importantly, we expect the markets for these type of transactions to grow from here, supported by the multi-trillion-dollar opportunity to finance the clean energy transition and AI infrastructure build-out. Another theme we're observing in the current rate backdrop is that the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers is persisting, hampering investment activity for most. At the industry level, the second quarter saw the lowest number of private equity deals in a quarter since the onset of COVID. This is a moment where our PE capabilities have the opportunity to shine. We believe that, unlike others, we're well positioned to capitalize amid these conditions given our ability to find value, structure creatively, and embrace complexity. As Marc highlighted, we've announced five transactions in just the last couple of months, representing approximately $15 billion in total enterprise value at an average creation multiple of under seven times. And our deal pipeline looks strong from here. Ultimately, all of our sourcing and origination activity is a function of being able to find interesting investments and deliver good outcomes. And indeed, we're doing that across the business. Returns across our yield-focused strategies remain strong. For example, direct origination and structured credit portfolios have appreciated 19% and 15% respectively over the last 12 months. Hybrid Value had a standout quarter with a portfolio appreciating 5% in the second quarter and 17% over the last year. And another of our flagship hybrid businesses, Accord & Accord Plus, has also delivered robust returns over the past year, totaling 17%. And as Marc alluded to earlier, our PE portfolios are enjoying very strong performance and are marked at very defensible valuations. Strong investment results are helping to drive strong capital formation. Inflow is totaled $39 billion in the second quarter across our asset management and retirement services businesses, bringing total inflows close to $80 billion in the first half of the year. Within that, third-party fundraising, excluding any leverage or segment transfers, has been particularly robust, totaling $20 billion and $33 billion in the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively. This momentum gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our $50 billion fundraising target this year. Second quarter fundraising activity included a record amount of third-party capital raised in yields, as well as strong hybrid inflows. Fundraising was diverse across a range of products and also benefited from some sizable institutional commitments. Some of the more significant drivers by strategy included asset-backed finance, multi-credit, large cap direct lending, ADIP, opportunistic credit, and infrastructure equity. Additionally, we recently secured a sizable strategic investment from Mizuho Bank in Apollo Clean Transition Capital, our flagship climate and transition credit strategy. This capital enables us to continue building a strong portfolio following initial seed investments in 2023 as we position the strategy for a broader fundraise next year. Importantly, Mizuho's limited partner commitment is the largest they've ever made, which speaks to their support and advocacy of energy transition as well as the broader Apollo relationship. Turning to global wealth, our momentum remains strong as we continue to solidify our position as one of the top players in the market. We've raised north of $6 billion in the first half of the year, including record fundraising in the second quarter, positioning us to exceed the $8 billion of capital raised last year. The most significant contributor to our growth momentum is Apollo Debt Solutions, the non-traded credit BDC we manage. Performance remains stellar with the fund's class, share returning more than 13% net over the past year from a portfolio comprised almost entirely of first-lien loans. Monthly inflows averaged over $500 million in the second quarter, reflecting these strong returns, continued traction with global distribution partners, as well as new approvals across channels. Additionally, we're focused on further broadening access to the strategy on a geographic basis by extending into Europe, Asia, and LatAm via our Luxembourg-based product platform. As we think about the evolution of our private credit offering in the global wealth channel, we're very excited about introducing an asset-back strategy as a compliment to what we've built with ADS. Initial interest in Apollo Asset-Back Credit Company, or ABC, has been quite strong, as we believe distributors recognize the scale, diversity, and maturity of our asset-backed finance franchise as a significant competitive advantage. We've just launched ABC in the global wealth market, and we expect flows to increase as we expand distribution to wirehouses over the coming quarters. More broadly, as we think about how best to access different client segments, we've also been engaged in a number of conversations around partnerships. Our role can and will take on multiple forms, ranging from joint ventures to parts provider. We're at the center of these conversations in what's an incredibly robust opportunity set. With that, let me turn it over to Martin to cover our financial results and more detail.\nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So as we execute on our strategy, the building blocks powering our business, asset origination, capital formation, and investment performance, as you've heard, are setting us up to continue generating attractive long-term earnings growth. Let me close out with some comments on our Q2 financial performance and outlook in advance of a comprehensive review about next five years at our Investor Day on October 1. Starting with FRE results, fee-related revenues increased 11% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by solid growth across all three revenue streams. Management fees grew 3% and 8% respectively, driven by strong capital formation activity. Capital solutions fees, as you heard, exceeded $200 million in a quarter for the first time, reflecting strong growth across the border debt origination ecosystem that included a record quarter of high-grade corporate solutions activity. And fee-related performance fees, which are spread-based versus NAV-based in our business, continued their upward trajectory. Driven by our credit business, including growth in ADS, these fees have a high degree of stability and are now run-rating at more than $200 million on an annualized basis. Looking to the second half of the year, management fee growth should be aided by healthy organic and closer to Athene, fundraising activity in equity strategies, and the deployment of capital with already raised. We're currently sitting on a record $55 billion of management fee eligible AUM, of which approximately 80% is in yield and hybrid strategies, which generate fees when the capital is invested. Given the robust results in capital solutions in the first half of the year, we expect full year fees to be stronger than originally expected, inclusive of expectations for normalized fee revenue in the third and fourth quarters, supported by the very healthy pipeline that Marc referenced. Turning to FRE expenses, the sequential increase in fee-related compensation resulted from continued investments in building out our capital formation and credit investing teams, as well as some pull-through of strong fee-related revenues to compensation. We also recognized a $15 million one-time item in non-comp expenses related to a fund merger that we previously commented on. Importantly, we're on track to grow total fee-related expenses by a low double-digit rate in 2024, inclusive of the one-time expense. SRE, so moving on to retirement services, the fundamentals underpinning a themed business remain fully intact and very strong relative to the industry. Organic inflows continue to be robust, totaling $17 billion in the second quarter and $37 billion year-to-date. We are benefiting from our four organic growth channels and leading market share in the U.S. annuity market as well as strong secular tailwinds driving demand for retirement income solutions. The combination of our first half results and competitive positioning gives us continued confidence in reaching our $70 billion organic inflow target for the full year. Profitability on new business has remained in line with targeted returns, both in terms of spread and ROE. Through our differentiated origination capabilities, we're able to invest new business volumes in attractive investments that generate excess spread through structure and liquidity. We've continued to deliver value so far this year, driven by deployment into directly originated investment-grade credit of more than $10 billion with an attractive excess spread of approximately 200 basis points above comparably rated public corporate benchmarks. In terms of our Q2 financial results, adjusting for long-term expectations of 11% for the alternative portfolio, the net spread would have been 27 basis points higher. And on a comparable basis, the Q2 net spread was six basis points lower than Q1. There are three dynamics that influence the spread performance. One, nearly $4 billion of highly profitable funding agreements issued during COVID market uncertainty at a low 2% cost of funds and invested at attractive spreads matured in Q2. Two, we strategically executed hedges, primarily in Q1 and in Q2, to immunize earnings exposure to potential changes in interest rates, the cost of which is expected to be an approximate 5% headwind to earnings growth this year. Three, we also allocated more than 40% of our first half purchases to corporate securities compared with 25% to 30% in 2023. And we experienced some back-weighted deployment activity, a dynamic we also experienced last quarter. Considering these factors and their impact on the second half of the year, along with in-line business performance, we expect our SRE growth rate for 2024 to be in the mid-signal digit percentage range, assuming 11% alternatives return. We anticipate our net spread to be approximately 150 basis points on the same basis. For the back half, we expect Q3 SRE to be in line with Q2 before growth resumes in Q4 at a more normalized rate. Turning to ADIP, integral to Athene\u2019s long-term success, we view the $6 billion fundraise for ADIP II, the second vintage of our strategic third-party capital sidecar, as further validation of Athene\u2019s attractive growth trajectory. This vehicle invests side-by-side Athene in new business, enabling Athene to scale in a capital efficient manner while providing an attractive risk-adjusted return to fund investors. Organic growth at Athene continues to be very attractive in today's environment, equating to an approximate 20% return on equity to the HoldCo when accounting for spread earnings, management fees, and sidecar fees generated. We view the sidecar strategy as a true strategic differentiator as we look to penetrate the massive retirement services addressable market in front of us. Before concluding, let me spend a moment on Athene's alts investments. Athene's alternative portfolio is highly diversified and constructed to generate a hybrid-like risk and return profile. Most of the portfolio is represented by AAA, which had a 9% return for Q2 and 10% over the last 12 months, inclusive of significant cash being held for future investment. The remainder of the portfolio is in several retirement services companies, including Athora, Catalina, Venerable, and FWD, which are all strategic investments and important to our long-term growth, but which have underperformed the broader portfolio on a market valuation basis. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I just want to get a clarifier on your outlook. So you talked about what would impact the second half versus the first half on the alternative net investment income, so I appreciate that. Is the back-to-double-digit trend next year? I just want to be clear. Does that mean 2025, you hope to grow low double digits over what is the new thought process around 2024? And you mentioned that includes an 11% return on volts, which was kind of half of that recently. Maybe you could help us with what produced the underperformance of Athora and then or what seems like a good environment. Why are they not performing their normalized return? Thanks a lot.\nMarc Rowan: So, Glenn, the short answer is yes to what you've said. But we do anticipate growing double digits over the results for 2024. In the Alts book, as Martin was saying, we have two types of alts. One is the invested alts. Most of the invested alts are inside of AAA, which is LTM 10-ish, just over 10. And that includes a substantial amount of cash, which is yet to be invested, which is being invested, which gives us great comfort that we'll beat 11. In terms of the back and forth over the strategic investments, Catalina and FWD have not performed well and are basically flat. Athora and Venerable in particular has been an awesome investment, but grew, I want to say, 16% to 20% last year. You just don't get a straight line. And Athora basically has been the same. It's been mid-teens rates of return, and this year it's up in the low single digits. So you do get some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter over the strategic alts. The other thing we're looking at is, and Martin mentioned this, you have a forward curve which talks about seven rate cuts. That is what we budget. And so we basically are going to an environment where we think we're going to earn low double digits against a backdrop of seven rate cuts. While we have dramatically reduced our exposure to rates, we have not fully immunized our exposure to rates. So that is a little bit of a headwind, and we're taking that into account when we're giving you guidance. Hopefully that's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi, Greg. Good morning, everybody. So, Marc, private fixed income has been obviously a huge growth driver for Apollo over the last several years, and we've spoken extensively about that. More recently, I think you started to highlight opportunities you see to further expand Apollo's private equity capabilities, and I was hoping you could spend a couple of minutes on what that could look like sort of two, three years out. I'm assuming you're going to spend quite a bit of time at the investor day, but maybe a bit of a preview would be helpful. And I guess looking at the more near-term opportunities, Fund 10 seems to be quite active, as you highlighted. How does that inform your thinking about Fund 11? Thanks.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. So I'll do some of it, and then Scott will pick up as he corrects or fills in for what I screw up. Let's start with this. Private equity is the traditional business on which the alternative asset management has been built. It is a 40-year-old business. Over the last decade in particular, call it 15 years, a lot of what has been produced was not the result of great investing, but it was the result of $8 trillion of money printing. Well, guess what? We stopped printing that magnitude of money, rates went up, and lots of people in the industry mistook good performance for actually a beta bet. We did not succumb to that. We are not facing the headwinds that the general private equity industry is facing, and what I wanted to do is really call it out. The benefit of purchase price matters is you get to be on offense. In markets like this, you get to produce good returns. I personally think this sets us up well for Fund 11. We have to deliver it, though. Scott, I'll leave it to Scott to speculate on timing and other things, but I'm feeling incredibly good about what the team is doing at private equity. Fixed income replacement, which you also mentioned, is happening, and I want to distinguish that from what people normally call private credit. Most of the usage of the term private credit refers to below-investment-grade direct lending, which I actually think is a terrific business, but it is funded primarily out of the alternatives bucket as an alternative to equity allocations What I'm talking about in fixed income replacement is primarily the replacement of public investment grade with private investment grade. I mean think about Intel as an example. Intel has bank debt. Intel has public bonds and now Intel has $11 billion of investment grade private credit The fact that there is a rating agency helps investors arbitrate as to whether they prefer to be in the bank debt, the public investment grade or the private IG. And the trends, if you think about what where money is needed in the world are the ones I cited there are three really long dated structured trends that are generally not appropriate for bank balance sheets, some of it will go to the public markets but an awful lot of it will go to the private marketplace and most of it is IG. As an industry, we have basically built an entire industry out of the smallest bucket of our institutional clients. And what I was pointing out is that we as an industry and us in particular now have access to the next largest bucket fixed income. We've never had access to it before. We're starting to get access to it. We will not be the only ones, but clearly I believe that we are in the leading position to do this because we were forced to do it and have been doing it for 15 years for Athene and for the insurance industry. So we've gotten a huge head start through the building of 16 platforms and everything else, you know. I am also pointing out that I believe we will at some point get access to the equity bucket of our institutional clients. 8,000 public companies is now 4,000 public companies. Most of our investors invest in public equities through indexation. 10 companies are 35% of the S&P. Four companies determine a hundred percent of their returns. I'm not sure that that's how they really thought their public equity portfolio is. 80% of companies over $100 million of revenue are private, 80% of employment is private. I believe that we will see investors own equity that is private, which to me in addition to owning private equity the distinction being leveraged. What is private equity at the end of the day? It is equity. With active management, in this case, active management defined as control of companies with leverage added to fit into a required high return of the alternatives bucket without the leverage maybe the new form of active management is the active running of companies rather than the active buying and selling of stocks. We've built a business that we call hybrid. That is a $50 billion plus business for us today and I believe on a percentage basis, will be our fastest growing business, because the equity bucket is as yet untapped and it is the largest bucket of our institutional clients. The thing that's here and now fixed income replacement, thing that I think we look forward to replacement.\nScott Kleinman: I think Marc, Marc said that well. Going back to your question around our private equity business, you're right, deployments going very well there as I alluded to it in my comments the market we're in right now is really the sweet spot for Apollo private equity deployment, and we see that continuing regardless of what that may do in a quarter or two. So as we look at, as we look at just deployment pacing, I would expect by the end of next year Fund 10 will be largely deployed and we'll be we'll be kicking off a fundraise for Fund 11. So that should give you a sense of the timeline there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Davitt: Hi, good morning everyone. Marc at a conference a couple months ago. I think you hinted that a partnership like the KK Capital Group 1 is on the come with two hybrid liquid products planned for launch this year. Do you have any update on the progress there and when you expect to actually have products like that in the market? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: The answer is yes, I still am confident that we are on track, and you will see the first product in the market in Q3 and where I'm hoping the second product will be in the market in Q4. I'm going to give you a little, I'm going to answer more than you want because I think it's important to explain in the business. One of the things we have to decide as an industry is whether we are limited by origination capacity or not. Historically, I have thought we've been a small in this, let's say, this way, we've been a small industry. We've never thought about a limitation to our growth as the capacity to originate. We've always thought about money raising as the capacity to it. I believe as the firms have matured, the limitation to our growth is essentially our ability to originate really good assets. We're finding this in fixed income. Every really good asset we originate has a home. Okay, we did really well for the quarter. It was $50 billion. That's great. We have to think about these partnerships as additive to our franchise, not in place of our franchise. If I'm right, that origination is, in fact, the core -- the key limitation to growth. First, we have to scale origination as much as we can responsibly in the context of our culture. And second, we have to not get excited by the shiny dot of distributing to third parties and not getting full fees for assets we otherwise wouldn't want to get full fees for them by sharing them. That is how we approach these partnerships. I think you will see not just the partnerships that I've alluded to. I think you will see lots of partnerships this year. All of the big firms have a seat at the table and a right to participate in this because they originate somewhat uniquely. You are going to see lots of interesting alignments. If you think about what's happening in asset management, more generally, active management traditionally defined has had a relatively tough decade. It has not outperformed the broader index for a very substantial portion of its time. Each of those active managers is undergoing their own strategy review. In some cases, they are buying alternative managers. And in other cases, they are partnering. This to me is one of the most exciting pieces of our business because we, as an industry, not just Apollo, we will reach family offices directly. It makes sense to cover them. They're just institutions. We will reach really high net worth served by the global wealth systems and RIAs. We will not, as an industry, build the infrastructure required to reach the vast, vast majority of investors who are already well served by traditional asset managers. I believe our role is, as Scott alluded to, to be a parts provider for those pieces of our product that we can originate and we like having the excess and to be a joint venture partner. And I can't tell you exactly how it is going to align, but it is one of the more interesting parts of our business right now. It is on track relative to my comments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Marc, you spoke to lumpiness quarter-over-quarter in some of the strategic investments that you guys have in your alts business, which is totally understandable. But given these are strategic investments, I think it would be really helpful to understand some of the sources of the weakness within these farms. If -- and it hasn't really it's my understanding that some of the weakness in those insurance properties, earnings has not just been like a one or two quarter phenomenon. And actually, that Catalina has been losing money. So could you speak to what has caused the weakness, what is going to result in that weakness reversing? And whether or not there's any active efforts on behalf of Apollo and Athene to help to support those earnings going forward? Thank you.\nMarc Rowan: Okay. So this will be -- I'm not going to use this call because it would take the whole call to go through it, but I will encourage Jim Belardi and team in their fixed income call to do a little more detail and really go through it and get you what you need. But I think the way we need to do is we need to look over a period of time. Venerable has been an extraordinarily profitable investment. I don't have the stats in front of me. But by memory, it is like 20% return over a long period of time. The business has volatility, and so we end up with very high returns in some quarter. There is nothing fundamentally wrong at Venerable. It's all doing great. Challenger, public company had a big run-up and then has been flat, but over time has been just fine. Athora had a big run-up and is now just flat and has been fine over time. Catalina, as you said, has been weak. Catalina is in the P&C closeout business. We decided that from a capital return, notwithstanding recent activity, we did not like the long-term trends of that business. So we are in the process of transitioning Catalina from its traditional business of old block P&C to simply being a sidecar for Athene. Catalina has a very attractive capital benefit for doing business in annuity through diversification benefits and otherwise. Catalina is a relatively small investment, and you should expect Catalina to be wound down over the next two years. If I step back, a little bit of what's going on here is a strategic -- is a legacy from the point in time that Apollo and Athene were not fully aligned. When Athene was its own entity and Apollo owned a third, it made sense that all the strategic stakes were held within the insurance company so that all the insurance company activity was held in a regulated entity. Since the merger, where now we own 100%. Many of these stakes should probably have been held the same way we hold MOTIV or Sophie Nova or something else as balance sheet investments of Apollo. And so what you're watching is a little bit in this quarter, a frustration on our part because on the one hand, the vast majority of the alts portfolio is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, and you're watching the lumpiness in some of the strategic stakes. The only strategic stake that is not performing where it is, is Catalina, and it's a relatively small stake and it is in the process of transitioning its business, and that's what's going on in Catalina.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, good morning everyone. I was actually just curious on the prepared comments that the liability outflows and retirement, I think we're going to stay elevated in the third quarter driven by funding agreements, because in the fixed income presentation that you guys update every quarter, it looked like they'd be elevated in the second quarter which they were, but they were going to step down in 3Q. So I'm just wondering kind of why the difference.\nMarc Rowan: I don't think there is a difference, I think you misheard. I think that we were saying that there is extraordinary levels of profitability associated with business that is terminating in the quarter rather than there will be deviations from the schedule. The schedule, as you know, we're pretty much on schedule, and we expect to be on schedule.\nMartin Kelly: Yes. It's Craig, it's the run rate impact, principally. The reason we've been so transparent in publishing our expected future maturities across the portfolio is to provide that guide. And if you look at actual experience relative to expectations, it's right on top this quarter going back in time, and obviously, we expect that to be the case going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about Asia. I know that's come up on prior calls and conversations, just as a meaningful opportunity set for you. I was hoping maybe you can update us on your initiatives overseas and Asia, remind us of your footprint there? How you see the opportunity set unfolding? Which particular countries you're most excited about? And in particular, I'd just be curious for any updated color on what you see evolving in Japan and the opportunity there? Thank you.\nScott Kleinman: Sure. Sure. It's Scott. Yes, no, as we've alluded to in prior quarters, our Asia business continues to grow pretty substantially, albeit from a small base starting a couple of years ago. Today, we have close to a couple of hundred employees on the ground in Asia across a number of different countries and a number of different asset classes. Just walking through I would say, from a PE perspective, we have really made a lot of progress in Japan. We've now announced and executed about 4 or 5 transactions over the last couple of years in Japan and have really established our presence there, most recently, just the deal announced a couple of months ago. So really like what we see from that market from a PE perspective. Other markets for PE, India and Australia would be where we're focused for private equity. Other things we're doing across Asia. We're building out our insurance capabilities. So whether it's through flow agreements and reinsurance agreements in Japan. As you know, some stakes in companies in Australia and Hong Kong. We continue to penetrate there, both on the liability side as well as asset management side for numerous Asian insurance companies that are that are looking for improved returns for their portfolios. And then on the credit side, we're continuing to scale really pan-Asia as a real opportunity as Marc alluded to in his comments, just the need for a thoughtful long-dated credit capital there is huge. And so that business continues to scale. So overall, we're being very methodic, very true to the Apollo value orientation strategy, safe, secured strategy, but there's real opportunity and we continue to scale it. So it's right now, it's, call it, in the 5% to 10% of Apollo dollars. That's as Apollo continues to grow at the rate it's growing, that percentage will probably remain constant, but continue to grow dollar-wise.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Bernstein: Hi, this is Alex Bernstein on for Ken. Thanks so much for taking the questions. We wanted to double click on the transaction. You've obviously done other similar large-scale deals. Some of the examples such as AT&T and Air France come to mind. But this one is obviously quite a bit bigger. So I think we wanted to double click and get a better understanding of how the transaction came together? How it may differ from some of the other ones? Or what made some of the lessons learned from the prior ones be? And then from a P&L perspective, to what extent it flows through the 2Q results that you reported, notably on the capital markets business side? If you can provide maybe a concept of just how big of an impact it was there obviously, record returns. And then perhaps what else we can look to expect from Q3 from this transaction? Thanks so much.\nScott Kleinman: Yes. So to talk about the transaction, while you're right, Intel is a bigger transaction than some of the previous ones we've announced. The way it comes together and the way it operates is actually very consistent with how we approach this high-grade capital solution activity, right? It is really to serve these type of large blue chip companies, you really have to bring all the resources of the firm to bear from the relationships that may exist across the firm, whether it's private equity or credit or otherwise, are structuring capabilities, or underwriting capabilities, or syndication capabilities. So on a transaction like Intel, probably, if I had to guess something like 50 different folks across the firm touch that transaction as it was coming together over a period of several months. So these are not sort of desk trades, if you will, the way a small middle market private credit might happen. These are really big undertakings that only firms like Apollo with the breadth of capabilities and relationships could really do. From a scale standpoint, while it was large, these are -- given the magnitude of what's transpiring and whether it's the digital infrastructure build-out, the deglobalization and the amount of infrastructure that has to be rebuilt across the globe, the energy transition and all of the capital required there. This is becoming more the norm of the types of dialogues that we're having. So I think you're going to see more and more of this type of scale or potentially even larger. And so again, only a very small number of firms can stand up and speak to that type of capital. And as you start to deal with companies like the ones you mentioned, right, counterparties matter. These are highly structured transactions, what are, in essence, partnerships, and so who these companies are partnering with to get these transactions done really matters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bradley Hays with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, it\u2019s Bradley [Indiscernible] on for Kanz. You spoke a bit about originations driving capital solutions fees. Could you give us a bit more color on the step-up in originations in the quarter, and in particular, how the non-U.S. origination opportunity contributed to that? And how we should be thinking about the go-forward pipeline?\nMarc Rowan: So I'll do a little bit and then I'll hand it over to Scott. So if you think about what we've done and you think about the world, we've done something for Sony. We've now told Corporate Japan that this is an opportunity. AB InBev, we've now told corporate Europe and Northern Europe we're open for business. Air France, we've now told that France were open for business. Vonovia, Germany, told them we're open for business. Intel with total technology and next-generation infrastructure were open for business. AT&T, open for business. What's happening is we are creating and watching the creation of a new market. The new market is being created, not just on the investor side where investors are actually considering fixed income replacement. It is happening on the issuer side. Rather than the issuer having a choice between bank debt and 10-year corporate bonds, the issuer now just has a third choice. We will not do every transaction. But the point is in the scale of the opportunity relative to the size of our business, we are watching accelerating growth. It will always be lumpy. You will always get the one big one in the quarter. But as a build and as a general trend line, we are watching private as a solution for capital needs take hold, and I like the way the strategy is shaping up. Governments around the world are going to borrow an awful lot of money over the next 10 years. We are going to have crowding. Banks are being asked directly or indirectly to stick to that, which is more matched to the shorter-term funding base, and they are generally not the right home for really long-dated capital. That leaves only two choices because capital -- credit in our economy comes from only two places. It comes from the banking system or the investment marketplace. In the investment marketplace, it can come from the public daily liquid market or it can come from the private match funded market. Not everything is going to end up in the private match-funded market, but an awful lot is going to, particularly given the three big drivers of capital.\nScott Kleinman: Yes. And just to your specific question, the -- I mean -- it should come as no surprise. We've been -- for the last two years, we've been talking about how the single most important thing we've been doing is scaling our origination capabilities in breadth and geography and category. And that's exactly what we have been doing. And an offshoot or ancillary item to origination is ACS and some of the excess that we don't consume across our controlled balance sheets, go through that ACS system. And so we've similarly been building our capabilities there. If you look at our ACS P&L, it's represented by literally hundreds of transactions. As Marc alluded to, once a quarter, there are one or two big ones, but the vast majority of what's flowing through that are just smaller trades that build up to work our quarterly earning there. And that's what you're seeing. We continue to invest in both the origination and the ACS side of our business, and we'll continue to invest in those areas because that really is the engine room, if you will, of everything else that we're talking about on the Apollo platform.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ben Budish with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here, again. I wanted to just ask on the capital markets fees. You alluded to a very strong back half of the year. I don't know if it's too early to ask, but any color on what 2025 looks like? I don't know if the pipeline kind of stretches out that far. And I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of a -- or better understanding of is to what degree does the back half of this year look like, an explosion of sort of pent-up demand versus a return to normal and what that might mean for the fiscal 2025? Thank you.\nMartin Kelly: Ben, it's Martin. So we -- the visible pipeline of business is about two quarters ahead, which you would probably expect. The business continues to grow. We're building our capabilities, geographies, awareness around the products and aligning the sort of supply, if you like, with demand for that. And so -- and as you recall, from the origination and platform sort of spotlight day we did almost a year ago, there are multiple homes for everything we originate. Pie goes to Athene, to its investment-grade portfolio, pie goes to third-party LPs through funds or managed accounts for which we earn a management fee and pie goes to capital solutions for which we own a transaction fee. So that makes that sort of equilibrium, if you like, holds. And as we grow the supply side, we can grow the demand side. But we would expect the business to continue ramping from here to answer your question briefly. It's an ecosystem. We have an advantage. It continues to build, and we're very enthusiastic about the growth from here.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now return the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing comments.\nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks again for joining our call this morning. As usual, if you have any questions about anything we discussed on the call, feel free to follow up with us. And we look forward to hosting you and are excited for you to join us for our Investor Day on October 1st. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "content": "Thanks. And as Marc touched on, each of our core business drivers, deployment, investment performance and capital formation, were strong in the second quarter and highlight that momentum across Apollo is building. As we've discussed, our current five-year plan is underpinned by three strategic growth pillars, including origination, global wealth and capital solutions, all of which are tracking ahead of our 2026 targets and fueling growth in our franchise and our earnings power. On the investing front, gross capital deployment surged to a record $70 billion in the second quarter. The driving force of this strong investing activity was debt origination, complemented by deployment in hybrid and equity strategies. Record debt origination in the second quarter was driven by broad-based strength across all three forms of origination, traditional, platforms and record levels of high-grade corporate solutions activity. Combined with the strong first quarter, debt origination volume in the first half of the year was close to the total amount originated for all of 2023, highlighting the increasing scale of our ecosystem. We expect momentum in overall deployment activity to persist given the line of sight we have to robust transaction pipelines in both our equity and debt-focused businesses. As a result of the higher interest rate backdrop and structural changes in traditional financing markets, we're seeing a lot of demand for customized, long-dated solutions that utilize debt capital, equity capital, or a combination of both. We believe we're uniquely positioned to meet this need by accessing our lower-cost, scaled long-duration capital within Athene and elsewhere, coupled with our flexible investment approach that aims to maximize risk return across the capital structure. Within second quarter activity, the Intel transaction Marc explained earlier is a prime example of how we combine these powerful advantages to serve clients in a differentiated way. Importantly, we expect the markets for these type of transactions to grow from here, supported by the multi-trillion-dollar opportunity to finance the clean energy transition and AI infrastructure build-out. Another theme we're observing in the current rate backdrop is that the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers is persisting, hampering investment activity for most. At the industry level, the second quarter saw the lowest number of private equity deals in a quarter since the onset of COVID. This is a moment where our PE capabilities have the opportunity to shine. We believe that, unlike others, we're well positioned to capitalize amid these conditions given our ability to find value, structure creatively, and embrace complexity. As Marc highlighted, we've announced five transactions in just the last couple of months, representing approximately $15 billion in total enterprise value at an average creation multiple of under seven times. And our deal pipeline looks strong from here. Ultimately, all of our sourcing and origination activity is a function of being able to find interesting investments and deliver good outcomes. And indeed, we're doing that across the business. Returns across our yield-focused strategies remain strong. For example, direct origination and structured credit portfolios have appreciated 19% and 15% respectively over the last 12 months. Hybrid Value had a standout quarter with a portfolio appreciating 5% in the second quarter and 17% over the last year. And another of our flagship hybrid businesses, Accord & Accord Plus, has also delivered robust returns over the past year, totaling 17%. And as Marc alluded to earlier, our PE portfolios are enjoying very strong performance and are marked at very defensible valuations. Strong investment results are helping to drive strong capital formation. Inflow is totaled $39 billion in the second quarter across our asset management and retirement services businesses, bringing total inflows close to $80 billion in the first half of the year. Within that, third-party fundraising, excluding any leverage or segment transfers, has been particularly robust, totaling $20 billion and $33 billion in the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively. This momentum gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our $50 billion fundraising target this year. Second quarter fundraising activity included a record amount of third-party capital raised in yields, as well as strong hybrid inflows. Fundraising was diverse across a range of products and also benefited from some sizable institutional commitments. Some of the more significant drivers by strategy included asset-backed finance, multi-credit, large cap direct lending, ADIP, opportunistic credit, and infrastructure equity. Additionally, we recently secured a sizable strategic investment from Mizuho Bank in Apollo Clean Transition Capital, our flagship climate and transition credit strategy. This capital enables us to continue building a strong portfolio following initial seed investments in 2023 as we position the strategy for a broader fundraise next year. Importantly, Mizuho's limited partner commitment is the largest they've ever made, which speaks to their support and advocacy of energy transition as well as the broader Apollo relationship. Turning to global wealth, our momentum remains strong as we continue to solidify our position as one of the top players in the market. We've raised north of $6 billion in the first half of the year, including record fundraising in the second quarter, positioning us to exceed the $8 billion of capital raised last year. The most significant contributor to our growth momentum is Apollo Debt Solutions, the non-traded credit BDC we manage. Performance remains stellar with the fund's class, share returning more than 13% net over the past year from a portfolio comprised almost entirely of first-lien loans. Monthly inflows averaged over $500 million in the second quarter, reflecting these strong returns, continued traction with global distribution partners, as well as new approvals across channels. Additionally, we're focused on further broadening access to the strategy on a geographic basis by extending into Europe, Asia, and LatAm via our Luxembourg-based product platform. As we think about the evolution of our private credit offering in the global wealth channel, we're very excited about introducing an asset-back strategy as a compliment to what we've built with ADS. Initial interest in Apollo Asset-Back Credit Company, or ABC, has been quite strong, as we believe distributors recognize the scale, diversity, and maturity of our asset-backed finance franchise as a significant competitive advantage. We've just launched ABC in the global wealth market, and we expect flows to increase as we expand distribution to wirehouses over the coming quarters. More broadly, as we think about how best to access different client segments, we've also been engaged in a number of conversations around partnerships. Our role can and will take on multiple forms, ranging from joint ventures to parts provider. We're at the center of these conversations in what's an incredibly robust opportunity set. With that, let me turn it over to Martin to cover our financial results and more detail. I think Marc, Marc said that well. Going back to your question around our private equity business, you're right, deployments going very well there as I alluded to it in my comments the market we're in right now is really the sweet spot for Apollo private equity deployment, and we see that continuing regardless of what that may do in a quarter or two. So as we look at, as we look at just deployment pacing, I would expect by the end of next year Fund 10 will be largely deployed and we'll be we'll be kicking off a fundraise for Fund 11. So that should give you a sense of the timeline there. Sure. Sure. It's Scott. Yes, no, as we've alluded to in prior quarters, our Asia business continues to grow pretty substantially, albeit from a small base starting a couple of years ago. Today, we have close to a couple of hundred employees on the ground in Asia across a number of different countries and a number of different asset classes. Just walking through I would say, from a PE perspective, we have really made a lot of progress in Japan. We've now announced and executed about 4 or 5 transactions over the last couple of years in Japan and have really established our presence there, most recently, just the deal announced a couple of months ago. So really like what we see from that market from a PE perspective. Other markets for PE, India and Australia would be where we're focused for private equity. Other things we're doing across Asia. We're building out our insurance capabilities. So whether it's through flow agreements and reinsurance agreements in Japan. As you know, some stakes in companies in Australia and Hong Kong. We continue to penetrate there, both on the liability side as well as asset management side for numerous Asian insurance companies that are that are looking for improved returns for their portfolios. And then on the credit side, we're continuing to scale really pan-Asia as a real opportunity as Marc alluded to in his comments, just the need for a thoughtful long-dated credit capital there is huge. And so that business continues to scale. So overall, we're being very methodic, very true to the Apollo value orientation strategy, safe, secured strategy, but there's real opportunity and we continue to scale it. So it's right now, it's, call it, in the 5% to 10% of Apollo dollars. That's as Apollo continues to grow at the rate it's growing, that percentage will probably remain constant, but continue to grow dollar-wise. Yes. So to talk about the transaction, while you're right, Intel is a bigger transaction than some of the previous ones we've announced. The way it comes together and the way it operates is actually very consistent with how we approach this high-grade capital solution activity, right? It is really to serve these type of large blue chip companies, you really have to bring all the resources of the firm to bear from the relationships that may exist across the firm, whether it's private equity or credit or otherwise, are structuring capabilities, or underwriting capabilities, or syndication capabilities. So on a transaction like Intel, probably, if I had to guess something like 50 different folks across the firm touch that transaction as it was coming together over a period of several months. So these are not sort of desk trades, if you will, the way a small middle market private credit might happen. These are really big undertakings that only firms like Apollo with the breadth of capabilities and relationships could really do. From a scale standpoint, while it was large, these are -- given the magnitude of what's transpiring and whether it's the digital infrastructure build-out, the deglobalization and the amount of infrastructure that has to be rebuilt across the globe, the energy transition and all of the capital required there. This is becoming more the norm of the types of dialogues that we're having. So I think you're going to see more and more of this type of scale or potentially even larger. And so again, only a very small number of firms can stand up and speak to that type of capital. And as you start to deal with companies like the ones you mentioned, right, counterparties matter. These are highly structured transactions, what are, in essence, partnerships, and so who these companies are partnering with to get these transactions done really matters. Yes. And just to your specific question, the -- I mean -- it should come as no surprise. We've been -- for the last two years, we've been talking about how the single most important thing we've been doing is scaling our origination capabilities in breadth and geography and category. And that's exactly what we have been doing. And an offshoot or ancillary item to origination is ACS and some of the excess that we don't consume across our controlled balance sheets, go through that ACS system. And so we've similarly been building our capabilities there. If you look at our ACS P&L, it's represented by literally hundreds of transactions. As Marc alluded to, once a quarter, there are one or two big ones, but the vast majority of what's flowing through that are just smaller trades that build up to work our quarterly earning there. And that's what you're seeing. We continue to invest in both the origination and the ACS side of our business, and we'll continue to invest in those areas because that really is the engine room, if you will, of everything else that we're talking about on the Apollo platform."

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So as we execute on our strategy, the building blocks powering our business, asset origination, capital formation, and investment performance, as you've heard, are setting us up to continue generating attractive long-term earnings growth. Let me close out with some comments on our Q2 financial performance and outlook in advance of a comprehensive review about next five years at our Investor Day on October 1. Starting with FRE results, fee-related revenues increased 11% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by solid growth across all three revenue streams. Management fees grew 3% and 8% respectively, driven by strong capital formation activity. Capital solutions fees, as you heard, exceeded $200 million in a quarter for the first time, reflecting strong growth across the border debt origination ecosystem that included a record quarter of high-grade corporate solutions activity. And fee-related performance fees, which are spread-based versus NAV-based in our business, continued their upward trajectory. Driven by our credit business, including growth in ADS, these fees have a high degree of stability and are now run-rating at more than $200 million on an annualized basis. Looking to the second half of the year, management fee growth should be aided by healthy organic and closer to Athene, fundraising activity in equity strategies, and the deployment of capital with already raised. We're currently sitting on a record $55 billion of management fee eligible AUM, of which approximately 80% is in yield and hybrid strategies, which generate fees when the capital is invested. Given the robust results in capital solutions in the first half of the year, we expect full year fees to be stronger than originally expected, inclusive of expectations for normalized fee revenue in the third and fourth quarters, supported by the very healthy pipeline that Marc referenced. Turning to FRE expenses, the sequential increase in fee-related compensation resulted from continued investments in building out our capital formation and credit investing teams, as well as some pull-through of strong fee-related revenues to compensation. We also recognized a $15 million one-time item in non-comp expenses related to a fund merger that we previously commented on. Importantly, we're on track to grow total fee-related expenses by a low double-digit rate in 2024, inclusive of the one-time expense. SRE, so moving on to retirement services, the fundamentals underpinning a themed business remain fully intact and very strong relative to the industry. Organic inflows continue to be robust, totaling $17 billion in the second quarter and $37 billion year-to-date. We are benefiting from our four organic growth channels and leading market share in the U.S. annuity market as well as strong secular tailwinds driving demand for retirement income solutions. The combination of our first half results and competitive positioning gives us continued confidence in reaching our $70 billion organic inflow target for the full year. Profitability on new business has remained in line with targeted returns, both in terms of spread and ROE. Through our differentiated origination capabilities, we're able to invest new business volumes in attractive investments that generate excess spread through structure and liquidity. We've continued to deliver value so far this year, driven by deployment into directly originated investment-grade credit of more than $10 billion with an attractive excess spread of approximately 200 basis points above comparably rated public corporate benchmarks. In terms of our Q2 financial results, adjusting for long-term expectations of 11% for the alternative portfolio, the net spread would have been 27 basis points higher. And on a comparable basis, the Q2 net spread was six basis points lower than Q1. There are three dynamics that influence the spread performance. One, nearly $4 billion of highly profitable funding agreements issued during COVID market uncertainty at a low 2% cost of funds and invested at attractive spreads matured in Q2. Two, we strategically executed hedges, primarily in Q1 and in Q2, to immunize earnings exposure to potential changes in interest rates, the cost of which is expected to be an approximate 5% headwind to earnings growth this year. Three, we also allocated more than 40% of our first half purchases to corporate securities compared with 25% to 30% in 2023. And we experienced some back-weighted deployment activity, a dynamic we also experienced last quarter. Considering these factors and their impact on the second half of the year, along with in-line business performance, we expect our SRE growth rate for 2024 to be in the mid-signal digit percentage range, assuming 11% alternatives return. We anticipate our net spread to be approximately 150 basis points on the same basis. For the back half, we expect Q3 SRE to be in line with Q2 before growth resumes in Q4 at a more normalized rate. Turning to ADIP, integral to Athene\u2019s long-term success, we view the $6 billion fundraise for ADIP II, the second vintage of our strategic third-party capital sidecar, as further validation of Athene\u2019s attractive growth trajectory. This vehicle invests side-by-side Athene in new business, enabling Athene to scale in a capital efficient manner while providing an attractive risk-adjusted return to fund investors. Organic growth at Athene continues to be very attractive in today's environment, equating to an approximate 20% return on equity to the HoldCo when accounting for spread earnings, management fees, and sidecar fees generated. We view the sidecar strategy as a true strategic differentiator as we look to penetrate the massive retirement services addressable market in front of us. Before concluding, let me spend a moment on Athene's alts investments. Athene's alternative portfolio is highly diversified and constructed to generate a hybrid-like risk and return profile. Most of the portfolio is represented by AAA, which had a 9% return for Q2 and 10% over the last 12 months, inclusive of significant cash being held for future investment. The remainder of the portfolio is in several retirement services companies, including Athora, Catalina, Venerable, and FWD, which are all strategic investments and important to our long-term growth, but which have underperformed the broader portfolio on a market valuation basis. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Yes. It's Craig, it's the run rate impact, principally. The reason we've been so transparent in publishing our expected future maturities across the portfolio is to provide that guide. And if you look at actual experience relative to expectations, it's right on top this quarter going back in time, and obviously, we expect that to be the case going forward. Ben, it's Martin. So we -- the visible pipeline of business is about two quarters ahead, which you would probably expect. The business continues to grow. We're building our capabilities, geographies, awareness around the products and aligning the sort of supply, if you like, with demand for that. And so -- and as you recall, from the origination and platform sort of spotlight day we did almost a year ago, there are multiple homes for everything we originate. Pie goes to Athene, to its investment-grade portfolio, pie goes to third-party LPs through funds or managed accounts for which we earn a management fee and pie goes to capital solutions for which we own a transaction fee. So that makes that sort of equilibrium, if you like, holds. And as we grow the supply side, we can grow the demand side. But we would expect the business to continue ramping from here to answer your question briefly. It's an ecosystem. We have an advantage. It continues to build, and we're very enthusiastic about the growth from here."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. Happy summer. Those in New York certainly know what I\u2019m talking about. This quarter was a good reminder that great companies are built by honoring the fundamental promise they have made to their clients. In our industry, alternative assets. The fundamental promise that we make to our clients is excess return per unit of risk. Absent that, I\u2019m not sure why we as an industry would exist. This promise, the delivery of this promise was on full display across the entirety of our franchise for the quarter, through a private equity and hybrid and in our credit franchise. Just a quick tour of the quarter. In private equity we announced three transactions in the past 30 days. Travel Corp, Everi and IGT Gaming, truly an amazing stat. The team is working round the clock. If you think about the last decade of our private equity franchise which is in compass by funds 9 and 10. $45 billion of capital, $13 billion already realized. In Fund [ph] 9 as of the end of the quarter, 29 gross 20 net. In Fund 10, 47 gross and 20 net. Notwithstanding head wins across the private equity industry by people who perhaps trade from a fundamental promise. The team is doing an unbelievable job. In hybrid or equity that is private, something we\u2019ll talk more about on investor day. AAA, which is our flagship vehicle returned 10% over the last 12 months with on-track quarterly results. We now have positive returns in AAA 16 quarters in a row. To give you a longer-term perspective of why investors like hybrid, we've had two down quarters over the past 38. In a market characterized by volatility, by indexation and correlation, by key bets on very high-flying companies, the notion that you can achieve double-digit rates of return in the equity market and still have downside protection and reduce volatility is incredibly attractive to investors across the entire spectrum, from retirees to those seeking to accumulate. We have 17 billion of NAV now in our AAA vehicle, and as I've suggested, I expect this will be our largest fund over a period of time. Credit, which is the largest of our franchise, also had an amazing quarter. We were early in credit, and we have built a leading and a differentiated franchise. Recall that the differentiation of our franchise is a unique focus on investment grade, private investment grade to be specific. To give you just some of the performance stats for our major vehicles for the quarter, our total return fund up nearly 2% for the quarter, 10% latest 12 months. Structured credit and ABS, 2% for the quarter, 15% for the latest 12 months. ADS, our direct lending vehicle, private market BDC, if you will, up 3.4% for the quarter, 17% latest 12 months. Direct origination, 3.8% for the quarter, 19% for latest 12 months. Across the entirety of the franchise, equity, hybrid, and credit, this was an awesome quarter. I start with performance because ultimately the reward for good performance is more work. In our case, more work is inflows. We had record inflows for the quarter for a non-PE franchise year of $39 billion. Institutional was $16 billion, global wealth, $4 billion, up 50% versus the first quarter, and Athene had organic inflows of $17 billion. It was truly a great quarter across asset management. Asset management is generally better fitting from tailwinds. What we're seeing in our business is not the result of a quarterly spike or peak. We're seeing a fundamental shift in the marketplace, and it is happening across the entirety of our franchise. If you step back and think about what the big drivers are, certainly the big driver in credit, we are looking at three really interesting trends. Think of the places that capital is needed in our economy over the next decade. We are going to spend an awful lot of money on next generation of infrastructure for data centers and AI. We are going to spend an equal amount of money for energy transition, and we are going to spend a lot of money on what I'll call normal infrastructure. All three of those things are long dated. Many of them are structured. Many of them are complex. These are the kinds of things that are not well suited for institutions who are funded short. These are exactly the kinds of transactions in the investment grade market that we expect to drive our business and are driving our business. The way we look at the driver of our business, certainly in credit, is by originations. Recall that we have a $125 billion target for this year for originations. We originated $52 billion in the quarter, including $11 billion from Intel alone. We are quickly approaching the $150 billion target that we set for 2026, and the team is unhappy to hear this because they know I'm going to revise the number up. Just to give you a sense for how strong the trends are, year-to-date we've deployed $17 billion in next generation infrastructure alone. I expect this not to be a one or two quarter blip. I expect this to drive our business over the next decade against the backdrop of regulatory change, against the backdrop of government borrowing, and all the other trends that we know are happening in fixed income. Origination also drives for us capital solutions. Capital solutions, fees, and revenues are the byproduct of a successful origination franchise. Fee revenue totaled more than $200 million. We are on pace for a record year. Our pipeline is as strong as it has ever been, and we will continue to build out the business both by industry and by geography, including major advances in Australia and in Asia because the need for originated high quality investment grade assets with spread is global. Let me turn now to Athene and Retirement Services. Retirement Services is now in its 15th year. We've basically grown our earnings over 15 years at 15%, including 26% last year. Just like in asset management, good performance is ultimately rewarded with more capital. In Athene\u2019s case, this is the ability to attract strategic investors to support Athene through its sidecar, which we call ADIP. ADIP is the capital engine that helps Athene scale its business and run a truly efficient franchise. ADIP II has now closed and raised $6 billion, almost twice as much as ADIP I. As far as we know, this is the largest third-party capital sidecar in the retirement services industry. For the quarter, Athene hit every operating metric. New business volumes, underwritten returns, credit quality, expenses, surrenders, capital. Profitability for the quarter was impacted by the roll-off of exceptionally profitable business, which was put on during the peak of COVID. That same roll-off of business will also occur in the next quarter. Also during the quarter, the disagreement over the direction of interest rates toward the beginning of the quarter provided us opportunities to do additional hedging, which we did for the quarter. The roll-off of this business and hedging essentially cost us growth for the quarter and will cost us growth for Q3. We expect by Q4 the business to grow and to be back on trend, the result being that we will achieve in our estimation mid-single-digits SRE growth for the year, accounting for the two lost quarters, and we will return to trend double-digit growth next year. Martin will detail further and will dissect the pieces of this business, which I know are of interest to many of you. Athene is on track for 70 billion of organic inflows for the year. When I step back, we are simply fortunate to have delivered on our core promise to customers and to be in a market and in an industry that is driven by long-term to tailwinds. We have essentially four tailwinds in front of us. The first I've already detailed, which is this voracious need for capital, most of which we believe to be investment grade. That will drive our fixed-income franchise, fixed-income replacement. The second, retirement is a fact of life. We are all getting older. We have so far over the first 15 years at Athene, one, by producing incredibly good returns not just for investors but for customers, but essentially what we have done is we have modernized existing products. The opportunity now exists for the entire next generation of products to serve retirees, whether they are in the traditional insurance sector or they are in the vast pool of 401-K, which here to four has been off limits to most alternative assets providers. The third, our entire industry over a 40-year period has been built out of a small bucket of the institutional marketplace. We are watching an individual marketplace, led by family offices and high-network individuals that I believe will grow to be the size of the institutional market over time. Finally, and a notion that we will spend lots of time on in investor day, we are watching investors fundamentally rethink the difference between public and private. We grew up thinking that private was risky and that public was safe, and that probably was true 40 years ago. Private represented three products, private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, and public diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. What if our fundamental premise is wrong? What if private is both safe and risky and public is both safe and risky? The entire basis on which we have constructed portfolio allocation will need to be rethought. I don't have to guess at this. This is already happening in the fixed income bucket of our large institutional clients who are making daily trade-offs between public investment grade and private investment grade. It is happening in fixed income first because there are helpful gatekeepers or signposts called rating agencies who help investors discern quality between public and private markets. It is also helped by that there is not real liquidity in public fixed income markets, so the trade-off of liquidity is not that immense. The opportunity in front of us over the next few years is fixed income replacement, which will provide a turbo charge to an otherwise healthy business. But make no mistake, replacement is coming for the equity business as well. We will end up with a portion of public equity that decides that equity can be private as well. And we will have access to other parts of our institutional investor\u2019s allocation. We look forward to seeing you at investor day. And it certainly has been an active summer. And with that, I will turn it over to Scott. So, Glenn, the short answer is yes to what you've said. But we do anticipate growing double digits over the results for 2024. In the Alts book, as Martin was saying, we have two types of alts. One is the invested alts. Most of the invested alts are inside of AAA, which is LTM 10-ish, just over 10. And that includes a substantial amount of cash, which is yet to be invested, which is being invested, which gives us great comfort that we'll beat 11. In terms of the back and forth over the strategic investments, Catalina and FWD have not performed well and are basically flat. Athora and Venerable in particular has been an awesome investment, but grew, I want to say, 16% to 20% last year. You just don't get a straight line. And Athora basically has been the same. It's been mid-teens rates of return, and this year it's up in the low single digits. So you do get some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter over the strategic alts. The other thing we're looking at is, and Martin mentioned this, you have a forward curve which talks about seven rate cuts. That is what we budget. And so we basically are going to an environment where we think we're going to earn low double digits against a backdrop of seven rate cuts. While we have dramatically reduced our exposure to rates, we have not fully immunized our exposure to rates. So that is a little bit of a headwind, and we're taking that into account when we're giving you guidance. Hopefully that's helpful. Okay. So I'll do some of it, and then Scott will pick up as he corrects or fills in for what I screw up. Let's start with this. Private equity is the traditional business on which the alternative asset management has been built. It is a 40-year-old business. Over the last decade in particular, call it 15 years, a lot of what has been produced was not the result of great investing, but it was the result of $8 trillion of money printing. Well, guess what? We stopped printing that magnitude of money, rates went up, and lots of people in the industry mistook good performance for actually a beta bet. We did not succumb to that. We are not facing the headwinds that the general private equity industry is facing, and what I wanted to do is really call it out. The benefit of purchase price matters is you get to be on offense. In markets like this, you get to produce good returns. I personally think this sets us up well for Fund 11. We have to deliver it, though. Scott, I'll leave it to Scott to speculate on timing and other things, but I'm feeling incredibly good about what the team is doing at private equity. Fixed income replacement, which you also mentioned, is happening, and I want to distinguish that from what people normally call private credit. Most of the usage of the term private credit refers to below-investment-grade direct lending, which I actually think is a terrific business, but it is funded primarily out of the alternatives bucket as an alternative to equity allocations What I'm talking about in fixed income replacement is primarily the replacement of public investment grade with private investment grade. I mean think about Intel as an example. Intel has bank debt. Intel has public bonds and now Intel has $11 billion of investment grade private credit The fact that there is a rating agency helps investors arbitrate as to whether they prefer to be in the bank debt, the public investment grade or the private IG. And the trends, if you think about what where money is needed in the world are the ones I cited there are three really long dated structured trends that are generally not appropriate for bank balance sheets, some of it will go to the public markets but an awful lot of it will go to the private marketplace and most of it is IG. As an industry, we have basically built an entire industry out of the smallest bucket of our institutional clients. And what I was pointing out is that we as an industry and us in particular now have access to the next largest bucket fixed income. We've never had access to it before. We're starting to get access to it. We will not be the only ones, but clearly I believe that we are in the leading position to do this because we were forced to do it and have been doing it for 15 years for Athene and for the insurance industry. So we've gotten a huge head start through the building of 16 platforms and everything else, you know. I am also pointing out that I believe we will at some point get access to the equity bucket of our institutional clients. 8,000 public companies is now 4,000 public companies. Most of our investors invest in public equities through indexation. 10 companies are 35% of the S&P. Four companies determine a hundred percent of their returns. I'm not sure that that's how they really thought their public equity portfolio is. 80% of companies over $100 million of revenue are private, 80% of employment is private. I believe that we will see investors own equity that is private, which to me in addition to owning private equity the distinction being leveraged. What is private equity at the end of the day? It is equity. With active management, in this case, active management defined as control of companies with leverage added to fit into a required high return of the alternatives bucket without the leverage maybe the new form of active management is the active running of companies rather than the active buying and selling of stocks. We've built a business that we call hybrid. That is a $50 billion plus business for us today and I believe on a percentage basis, will be our fastest growing business, because the equity bucket is as yet untapped and it is the largest bucket of our institutional clients. The thing that's here and now fixed income replacement, thing that I think we look forward to replacement. The answer is yes, I still am confident that we are on track, and you will see the first product in the market in Q3 and where I'm hoping the second product will be in the market in Q4. I'm going to give you a little, I'm going to answer more than you want because I think it's important to explain in the business. One of the things we have to decide as an industry is whether we are limited by origination capacity or not. Historically, I have thought we've been a small in this, let's say, this way, we've been a small industry. We've never thought about a limitation to our growth as the capacity to originate. We've always thought about money raising as the capacity to it. I believe as the firms have matured, the limitation to our growth is essentially our ability to originate really good assets. We're finding this in fixed income. Every really good asset we originate has a home. Okay, we did really well for the quarter. It was $50 billion. That's great. We have to think about these partnerships as additive to our franchise, not in place of our franchise. If I'm right, that origination is, in fact, the core -- the key limitation to growth. First, we have to scale origination as much as we can responsibly in the context of our culture. And second, we have to not get excited by the shiny dot of distributing to third parties and not getting full fees for assets we otherwise wouldn't want to get full fees for them by sharing them. That is how we approach these partnerships. I think you will see not just the partnerships that I've alluded to. I think you will see lots of partnerships this year. All of the big firms have a seat at the table and a right to participate in this because they originate somewhat uniquely. You are going to see lots of interesting alignments. If you think about what's happening in asset management, more generally, active management traditionally defined has had a relatively tough decade. It has not outperformed the broader index for a very substantial portion of its time. Each of those active managers is undergoing their own strategy review. In some cases, they are buying alternative managers. And in other cases, they are partnering. This to me is one of the most exciting pieces of our business because we, as an industry, not just Apollo, we will reach family offices directly. It makes sense to cover them. They're just institutions. We will reach really high net worth served by the global wealth systems and RIAs. We will not, as an industry, build the infrastructure required to reach the vast, vast majority of investors who are already well served by traditional asset managers. I believe our role is, as Scott alluded to, to be a parts provider for those pieces of our product that we can originate and we like having the excess and to be a joint venture partner. And I can't tell you exactly how it is going to align, but it is one of the more interesting parts of our business right now. It is on track relative to my comments. Okay. So this will be -- I'm not going to use this call because it would take the whole call to go through it, but I will encourage Jim Belardi and team in their fixed income call to do a little more detail and really go through it and get you what you need. But I think the way we need to do is we need to look over a period of time. Venerable has been an extraordinarily profitable investment. I don't have the stats in front of me. But by memory, it is like 20% return over a long period of time. The business has volatility, and so we end up with very high returns in some quarter. There is nothing fundamentally wrong at Venerable. It's all doing great. Challenger, public company had a big run-up and then has been flat, but over time has been just fine. Athora had a big run-up and is now just flat and has been fine over time. Catalina, as you said, has been weak. Catalina is in the P&C closeout business. We decided that from a capital return, notwithstanding recent activity, we did not like the long-term trends of that business. So we are in the process of transitioning Catalina from its traditional business of old block P&C to simply being a sidecar for Athene. Catalina has a very attractive capital benefit for doing business in annuity through diversification benefits and otherwise. Catalina is a relatively small investment, and you should expect Catalina to be wound down over the next two years. If I step back, a little bit of what's going on here is a strategic -- is a legacy from the point in time that Apollo and Athene were not fully aligned. When Athene was its own entity and Apollo owned a third, it made sense that all the strategic stakes were held within the insurance company so that all the insurance company activity was held in a regulated entity. Since the merger, where now we own 100%. Many of these stakes should probably have been held the same way we hold MOTIV or Sophie Nova or something else as balance sheet investments of Apollo. And so what you're watching is a little bit in this quarter, a frustration on our part because on the one hand, the vast majority of the alts portfolio is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, and you're watching the lumpiness in some of the strategic stakes. The only strategic stake that is not performing where it is, is Catalina, and it's a relatively small stake and it is in the process of transitioning its business, and that's what's going on in Catalina. I don't think there is a difference, I think you misheard. I think that we were saying that there is extraordinary levels of profitability associated with business that is terminating in the quarter rather than there will be deviations from the schedule. The schedule, as you know, we're pretty much on schedule, and we expect to be on schedule. So I'll do a little bit and then I'll hand it over to Scott. So if you think about what we've done and you think about the world, we've done something for Sony. We've now told Corporate Japan that this is an opportunity. AB InBev, we've now told corporate Europe and Northern Europe we're open for business. Air France, we've now told that France were open for business. Vonovia, Germany, told them we're open for business. Intel with total technology and next-generation infrastructure were open for business. AT&T, open for business. What's happening is we are creating and watching the creation of a new market. The new market is being created, not just on the investor side where investors are actually considering fixed income replacement. It is happening on the issuer side. Rather than the issuer having a choice between bank debt and 10-year corporate bonds, the issuer now just has a third choice. We will not do every transaction. But the point is in the scale of the opportunity relative to the size of our business, we are watching accelerating growth. It will always be lumpy. You will always get the one big one in the quarter. But as a build and as a general trend line, we are watching private as a solution for capital needs take hold, and I like the way the strategy is shaping up. Governments around the world are going to borrow an awful lot of money over the next 10 years. We are going to have crowding. Banks are being asked directly or indirectly to stick to that, which is more matched to the shorter-term funding base, and they are generally not the right home for really long-dated capital. That leaves only two choices because capital -- credit in our economy comes from only two places. It comes from the banking system or the investment marketplace. In the investment marketplace, it can come from the public daily liquid market or it can come from the private match funded market. Not everything is going to end up in the private match-funded market, but an awful lot is going to, particularly given the three big drivers of capital."

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded. \n This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performances. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. \n Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP measures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation for an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund. \n I will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. \nNoah Gunn: Thanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. \n We report strong first quarter financial results, which included FRE of $462 million or $0.75 per share and SRE of $817 million or $1.32 per share. Together, these 2 earnings streams totaled $1.3 billion, increasing 18% year-over-year. \n Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported adjusted net income of $1.1 billion or $1.72 per share, up 26% year-over-year. Additionally, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $0.46 per share for the first quarter, reflecting the new higher annual run rate level of $1.85 per share as previously announced. \n Joining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. \n Before handing it over, I'd like to formally announce that we are hosting an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, October 1. We will provide additional detail in the coming months and hope that you will join our broader team as we discuss the exciting long-term growth opportunities in front of us. \n And with that, I'll now hand it over to Marc. \nMarc Rowan: Thank you, Noah, and good morning. As Noah detailed, first quarter results were strong. Personally, I was very pleased. FRE was $462 million, up 16% year-over-year. And you will hear a little bit from me but mostly from Jim, there is momentum in every part of the business. For SRE, we reported $817 million, up 19% year-over-year. Key note for the quarter, a record inflow of $20 billion for the quarter. \n I'm going to spend some time providing color on the quarter but then quickly move to the outlook for the year. In the quarter, particularly with respect to SRE, we had 3 things going on. The first, really good. The team generated, as I suggested, $20 billion of inflows diversified across their funding channels, particularly three of their funding channels. \n While they generated what they needed to, and origination, as you will hear, was very strong, they were somewhat mixed in terms of timing. The generation of liabilities took place at a relatively even pace, whereas most of the origination was back-end loaded, resulting in higher cash balances for the quarter, which we expect to even out across the year. The second, alternatives had a slight underperformance versus what we historically have normalized or come to expect had normalized. \n But the biggest action in the quarter was our move to significantly derisk the floating rate book. Recall that we run a common sense strategy. When rates are very low, we have been able to earn very nice rates of return without maximizing current period SRE and putting on significant floating rate exposure, which gives us upside as rates normalize. You should expect, as rates have returned to more normalized levels, we use this as an opportunity to significantly reduce our exposure. \n Exposure now is about $16 billion, probably where we're going to leave it for the near term. Sensitivity of 100 basis points move at floaters at this point is less than 5% of SRE. You should expect us to continue to move floating rate exposure up and down, reflecting first, the nature of our business; and the fact that we do not have -- while on the upside, we have linear participation in rates, on the downside, we do not have linear participation in rate falls. And second, there is a nice hedging element to having a certain amount of floating rate exposure vis-a-vis performance of liabilities during changes of interest rates. \n All in all, a really strong quarter and one that gives me increased confidence that the outlook that we sketched out for all of you coming into this year will be met. I view this as on-trend. \n FRE, we're expecting 15% to 20% growth in our -- in the non-flagship PE year versus the 25% we grew in '23. We have plenty of opportunities to invest in the business. And the trade-off as to where we end up between 15% and 20% will be, in my opinion, based on how much we choose to invest in the future. \n SRE, we are targeting low double-digit growth, which we believe reflects the long-term run rate growth rate of our Retirement Services business. We do expect to still meet or exceed the $70 billion of organic inflows in 2024. \n If I were to highlight momentum in the business, I'll pick out the 2 or 3 things that I think are really exceptional. The first, the lifeblood of our business is origination. $40 billion of originations for the quarter, roughly half from our platforms. Platforms, as you recall, are unique to Apollo and represent a recurring and enduring and growing source of origination. We, in my opinion, can only grow as fast as we can originate assets that provide excess return per unit of risk, and this is a significant focus for the firm. \n Capital formation was also very strong for the quarter. Before I touch on the numbers, I'll touch on the philosophy. Capital formation is an important part of our business, but we have to be very careful to be measured in capital formation and not simply accept money at all costs at all times. We need to invest it prudently, particularly in new and growing segments where we are building investor trust. \n For the quarter, capital formation was $40 billion, roughly $20 billion coming from Retirement Services and $20 billion coming from asset management. In the asset management business, there was a lot of momentum in global wealth, in particular, very strong performance at ADS. Recall that ADS is our 100% first lien, lowest leverage, run defensively, direct lending business. The team there has done a spectacular job. \n There's also momentum in institutional. I'd pick out asset-based finance and third-party insurance as highlights for the quarter. Asset-backed finance is directly tied to our capacity to originate as many of the products that come off our platforms end up or are consumed in asset-backed form. \n It is also tied to our philosophy of wanting 25% of everything and 100% of nothing, which produces unique alignment with our third-party insurance and third-party institutional and other clients. ABF is particularly well suited to insurance company balance sheets. There were $8 billion of ABF flows in Q1, including a multibillion dollar strategic investment from a like-minded leading financial institution. \n In summary, momentum has been building in the quarter. And I believe we are set for and on track, consistent with guidance here. While this year is interesting, and Noah has already highlighted our Investor Day, share with you how the team thinks about the future. \n We are in a really exciting industry. The two big pillars of growth that we see ahead of us are first, retirement. Like it or not, we're all getting older. The need for guaranteed lifetime income, guaranteed retirement income everywhere in the world exceeds what is currently provided. Whether you look at aging of population, whether you look at the decline of defined benefit plans, whether you look at the inadequacy or lack of preparation of governments around the world, I continue to believe that retirement is going to be a massive driver of our business. Retirement is ultimately built on a foundation of fixed income. \n The second and perhaps bigger trend in our business is a wholesale revisiting by investors of the ABCs of portfolio construction. And when I say investors, I mean institutions and individuals. We are an industry that has been built out of the smallest asset allocation of our institutional clients. \n In a very simple way, I think of our institutional clients as being primarily allocated, at least half to publicly traded equities; 30% allocated to publicly traded fixed income; and 20% allocated to everything else, meaning alternatives. Our entire industry growth has been out of that 20% bucket. \n 20% is the so-called private or alternative bucket made sense in a world where private was risky and public was safe. I believe we are revisiting the most fundamental concepts that underlie our financial markets. Private now goes from AA to levered equity; and public, which was 8,000 public companies, there's now 4,000 public companies. And the reality is 10 represents 35% of the S&P 500 and unique concentration to 2 or 3 companies. \n Investors are already looking to their fixed income bucket, which historically has been off limits, and starting to ask questions about what is the difference between public and private? If both are safe and risky, this is just a question of liquidity trade-off. And liquidity trade-off is actually getting much, much closer. Liquidity in publicly traded fixed income is at record lows. Liquidity for private credit is actually increasing daily. \n We are not -- I'm not saying that we're going to pass each other, but the notion that investors will begin to allocate to private markets, an entire asset bucket that they have not historically allocated to private markets, presents our entire industry with just an unusual path toward extreme growth. \n I believe the same will happen in the equity bucket. An investor who wants exposure to the economy used to get it in public markets. Now more than half the economy is in private markets. While that allocation may not be to private equity, private equity being a product, a 10-year locked-up fund seeking very high rates of return with leverage. I believe investors increasingly will seek out equity exposure in private markets in other forms that exist today. And it is our job, as in our industry, to create the products for the future to allow investors to access 100% of the economy, given that it is no longer in public markets. \n For us to succeed, this is not really a question of opportunity, this is a question of execution. Execution starts with origination. We can only grow our business as fast as we can originate. As you heard, $40 billion for the quarter. We have discussed publicly $125 billion goal of origination for the year. Our original 5-year plan had us getting to $150 billion by 2026, which I hope we will exceed. And no doubt, Investor Day will exceed $200 million (sic) [ $200 billion ] as our midrange target for where we need to be in origination. Again, growth in our business is limited only by our capacity to eliminate -- to originate good risk. \n The second thing we need to do is to prepare for a change in how capital is formed. Capital -- the change is already happening, given the importance of global wealth to our industry. And we will be one of the successful players in that industry. And we value these relationships and run the business on a long-term basis. \n We are essentially needing to build different ways of communicating with our clients. Historically, as you know, we've raised money from our institutional clients out of their alternatives bucket. And increasingly, we will need to cover their fixed income bucket and eventually their equity bucket. I believe we are well positioned to do this, and this is coming at a good time for us and for our industry. \n And also if one steps back and thinks about where capital need is in the world, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's energy transition or whether it is to adapt to new technologies of data centers and the need for power, all three of those things represent long-term financing. \n I do not believe that long-term financing is well suited to the shorter-nature balance sheets of the banking system nor to the daily liquid fund market. Increasingly, these long-term capital needs will be matched with long-term funding from our retail and institutional clients. \n So again, number one, origination; number two, capital formation; and finally, product development, particularly in equity. \n The migration of the fixed income bucket to private markets is already happening, and it's happening faster than I thought. In some ways, we expect that because there are signposts there. Rating agencies rate things in public markets and private markets. And so investors, as they begin to think about this transition, can look to credit ratings and others as a sign of comparability between public market and private market risk. \n Equity markets lack the same sort of signposts. It is up to us as an industry to develop those kinds of products, and I'm excited about what the future looks like, not just in transition in the credit bucket but also in the equity bucket. \n In summary, I like the hand we're playing. We are incredibly well positioned in Retirement Services with a decade-long lead over most of our competition. The work we have done on fixed income replacement and private investment grade, I believe, is particularly well suited for the transition that is taking place as institutions and individuals migrate their historically 100% public fixed income exposure to public and private. And I believe we are well positioned with our hybrid business to begin to address the migration that I expect to take place in equity. \n Jim, over to you. \nJames Zelter: Great. Thanks, Marc. Let me dive into a few more details. The foundation of our business is built upon delivering strong investment returns for our clients. And we have historically done so by upholding a purchase price matters investment philosophy across market cycles and strategies, which embrace downside protection structure in return for excess return per unit of risk. \n Most recently, the industry has evolved into a paradigm marked by higher for longer rates, tighter spreads and extreme valuations, and we've responded accordingly. Over the last several quarters, we focused on larger companies and transactions at the top of the capital structure while employing less leverage than others in the industry. \n Marc mentioned the ADS, Apollo Debt Solutions. There's a great example of that, where we produced a 14.5% return over the last year but a conservatively levered balance sheet of 0.6 with a 100% corporate loan portfolio. \n Additionally, we continue to generate meaningful excess return in this intersection of equity and credit, which we define as hybrid, driven by a variety of structural changes and inefficiencies in the market. Our 2 flagship strategies in this area, the Accord series and the Hybrid Value series, have generated particularly strong returns, appreciating 4% in the first quarter and more than 16% over the last year. \n Alongside investment performance, capital formation is a critical driver of our growth. We generated strong inflows across the business in the first quarter, as Marc highlighted, including $20 billion from our asset management business and $20 billion from Athene. And organic inflows, excluding any leverage or segment transfers, totaled $33 billion, which is on track with our $120 billion target for the year. \n Double-clicking on this third-party fundraising. Credit-oriented strategies were very much in focus and accounted for more than 80% of capital raised in the quarter. Some of the more significant contributors included $3 billion to broadly support the growth of the Atlas ecosystem, $3 billion for high-grade alpha separately managed accounts, $2 billion for large-cap direct lending and our recently launched asset-based -- asset-backed finance fund. \n As Marc mentioned, it is worth double-clicking on the fact that we've raised $6.5 billion of the capital from third-party insurers, reflecting the significant roads -- inroads we've made in this important growth area over the last handful of years. We're focused on delivering strategies that sit at the intersection of Athene's unique SRE playbook and Apollo's broad asset management capabilities, namely investment-grade private credit, which we believe is ideally suited for these insurance company investment portfolios. \n To illustrate the scale of our alpha-generating capabilities, we've originated close to $80 billion of assets through platforms and corporate solutions over the last 12 months, which has generated between 150 and 200 basis points of excess spread versus comparatively rated liquid credits. As we continue to grow in these debt origination capabilities, we expect there will be growing interest from third-party insurers to invest alongside in the full spectrum of our ecosystem, a dynamic we've started to see. And all this works because of our alignment with Athene, which is critical to our value proposition. \n Moving on to global wealth, which is a strategic and growing contributor of our capital formation activity. Our journey in building out this business, we've realized there are 5 crucial components in order to succeed: Investment performance, education, distribution capabilities, technology and a diversified product list, all of which we've successfully established over the last 24 months. \n We believe that only a small group of firms can deliver on all 5. And with continued strategic focus and investment, we see ourselves among the best positioned for long-term success. The numbers bear this out as we've more than doubled our run rate fundraising level with our holistic suite of products. Monthly inflows approached $1 billion in April, a meaningful increase from approximately $650 million just a quarter ago and less than $400 million a year ago. \n As I mentioned, one of the primary drivers of this activity has been our flagship corporate direct lending offering, ADS. April subscriptions totaled over $500 million, bringing year-to-date subscriptions to approximately $1.7 billion. And this represents approximately a 400% increase in flows year-to-date compared to last year. \n Part of the step-up reflects recent market share gains in the non-traded BDC space with ADS capturing 17% of total inflows in 2024 so far compared to only 10% at the run rate in the fourth quarter. This overall growth has been enabled by leading investment performance combined with our expanding distribution footprint and attractive yield. \n The next step in the expansion of our credit-focused product set within global wealth channel, we're on track to launch a new asset-backed finance vehicle in the coming weeks. Apollo asset-backed credit company, or ABC, is a semiliquid turnkey solution designed to provide our credit investors across our differentiating -- to access our differentiated origination capabilities and builds on the initial traction we've seen in our broader asset-backed franchise. \n We believe the breadth and scale of our proprietary origination ecosystem, not just for sourcing from Wall Street, will position us to be a market leader in this nascent and important growth area of the global wealth market. Importantly, we structured ABC as an operating company, enabling us to access our full range of origination capabilities versus other traditional private credit structures. \n And finally, Apollo Aligned Alternatives, better known as AAA, is our semiliquid equity replacement strategy, continues to be an important part of our global wealth offering. We raised $700 million of capital in the first quarter and continue to see strong fundraising momentum. \n We have a pipeline of new distribution partners preparing to launch the fund over the next course of the year. And interestingly, we're also seeing growing interest from the consultant community and insurance companies as a cost-effective, scaled solution for private markets exposure. \n Stepping back for a moment. We've observed that many in our industry have discovered the language of origination. As a result, our definition of fixed income replacement and private credit, a $40 trillion addressable market, has become mainstream and distinct from the traditional view of private credit. We were pioneers of these concepts 36 months ago and expect to continue blazing the path forward for this important area of secular growth. \n As part of that, scaling our debt origination volume production is a strategic focus, and our quarterly results highlight that we're continuing to make meaningful progress. As Marc mentioned, total debt origination volumes of nearly $120 billion over the last 12 months is up almost 40% compared with our prior year period. \n As a reminder, we originate assets across our yield ecosystem through three main channels: The traditional channel, platforms and corporate solutions. And more recently, we've identified partnerships with other financial institutions as the fourth avenue that we plan to expand over time. Additionally, we have expanded our focus on a fifth leg, the broad equity and hybrid ecosystem as well, which you will hear more from us in the future. \n Over the past year, our platform ecosystem has been the primary driver of origination growth, having roughly doubled volume production over that period. ATLAS SP, our warehouse finance and securitized products business, has been the major driver of that activity. \n One notable win to highlight in the first quarter was the $8 billion purchase of seller financing facilities from UBS. We acquired this portfolio at an attractive excess spread for IG-equivalent risk, which also proved accretive and attractive to third-party investors as we materially oversubscribed on half the trade and distributed accordingly. Looking forward, with the ATLAS business fully operational, independent and armed with a significant amount of strategic capital, both debt and equity, we're focused on meaningfully scaling that platform. \n While platforms are an essential component of our origination ecosystem, we're also highly focused on growing our corporate solutions platform and business. We're investing a tremendous amount of time with a broad array of the largest, most sophisticated companies to educate them on the benefits of our multifaceted credit toolkit or toolbox and the benefits it can provide, namely speed, certainty, size and customization. And we're beginning to see those efforts bear tremendous fruit. \n And finally, we believe that partnerships will become a growing contributor of our origination capacity over time. Historically, and especially over the last several years, we believe we've been on the cutting edge of strategic dialogue with various financial institutions. We're seeking to extend our vast array of solutions to these firms in a partnership manner which in turn will help expand our platform. \n Importantly, as we scale our debt origination capacity and expand newer areas of equity-focused investing, we're creating more consistent and diversified deal activity that feeds into our Capital Solutions business. While quarterly variability in fee revenue should be expected, we're observing that the business is reaching a point of consistency amid continued growth potential. In the first quarter specifically, Capital Solutions fees were solid, supported by record quarterly gross capital deployment of nearly $60 billion across the platform. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Martin for more detail. \nMartin Kelly: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me close out with some brief comments on our financial performance. Our first quarter results positioned us well to deliver on the financial targets we've communicated for 2024, which signal an attractive mid-teens earnings growth trajectory.\n We view the sustainability and predictability of our earnings profile as highly valuable and increasingly appreciated by the market, especially against the backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty that has impacted more cyclical revenue streams. \n Starting with the asset management side of the business. FRE trends remained solid with 16% growth year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth of 13% and cost growth of 9%. As we look towards the remainder of the year, we're on pace to generate the fee-related revenue growth, margin expansion and overall FRE dollar growth we have indicated. \n We expect growth in fee revenue to be supported by strong and diversified capital formation, a record $50 billion of dry powder with future management fee potential, and a robust capital solutions outlook that should deliver a strong second and third quarter based on the pipeline we see today. \n For expenses, we will continue to manage our cost base prudently while selectively investing in key areas, principally global wealth and our credit business. We also expect to recognize a $15 million onetime non-comp expense related to the previously announced merger of two closed-end funds with and into MidCap Financial Investment Corp., a publicly traded BDC we manage, which will most likely occur in the second quarter on the closing of these transactions and which was contemplated in our original expense growth guidance for the year. \n Altogether, we expect to generate between 15% and 20% FRE growth, as Marc indicated, in line with our growth expectations for a year in which we do not raise a flagship PE fund. \n Turning to Retirement Services. We reported SRE of $817 million at a 147 basis point net spread. Adjusting for long-term expectations for alternative returns, net spread would have been 10 basis points higher in the first quarter; and on a comparable basis, 9 basis points lower than fourth quarter levels. \n This sequential decline was driven by 2 factors; One, higher on the margin cost of new business in the higher interest rate environment, together with the delayed deployment into higher-yielding assets that Marc highlighted; and two, an approximate 5 basis point in-quarter spread impact associated with hedging a portion of Athene's net floating rate position and higher hedging costs on certain in-force business. \n As Marc suggested, we reduced the net floating rate portfolio by $9 billion to $16 billion during the first quarter, which results in 7% of net invested assets being subject to floating rate indices. As part of this hedging effort, we swapped $8 billion of fixed rate liabilities to floating and issued $4 billion of additional floating rate funding agreements with the negative carry associated with each recognized as part of our cost of funds in the quarter. We believe that this level of floating rate securities will adequately equip us from a strategic standpoint while also protecting future earnings power should rates decline materially. \n Given the smaller portfolio size, our floating rate income sensitivity has commensurately decreased to approximately $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE for every 25 basis point move in short-term rates, down from the $45 million to $55 million that we previously indicated. \n We expect the timing differential between origination and deployment of capital to normalize through net spread in coming quarters. More specifically, there were two large asset transactions that closed towards the end of March which, had they closed midway through the quarter, would have created a further 3 basis points of higher net spread in quarter. \n Considering key components of Athene's earnings growth outlook versus our fourth quarter call, namely first quarter net spread results, a smaller floating rate portfolio and fewer expected rate cuts as implied by the forward curve, we continue to expect net spread of approximately 160 to 165 basis points for the full year, which excludes notable items and assumes an 11% annualized alts return. We expect this range of net spread, coupled with robust organic growth, to support low double-digit SRE growth this year versus the comparable 2023 base. \n In -- turning to PII. PII has been an expectedly modest contributor to our earnings base in recent quarters as we await a more favorable backdrop to monetize investments. First quarter realized performance fees were also impacted by an impairment on a position held in Fund IX. Looking to the second quarter, we currently expect to generate a similar amount of PII as the first quarter. \n An important catalyst to reignite realization activity is a reopening of the IPO market as only around 10% of our fund's total PE portfolio is publicly traded today. We've seen early signs of this happening and see a path for an acceleration in PE realizations into 2025 and beyond. Increasing amounts of realized carry would generate additional cash flow to deploy into opportunistic share repurchases, enabling us to execute on our plan to reduce our share count to approximately 600 million shares by the end of 2026. \n Finally, on taxes. After a large non-recurring benefit in the prior quarter, which reduced the 2023 annual rate, we experienced a 17% effective tax rate in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 20%, consistent with our long-term guidance with a rate slightly above 20% expected in the second quarter. \n In closing, we are generating significant momentum as we continue executing on our business plan, which is setting the stage for our next phase of growth. The earnings power of the business has tremendous potential, and we look forward to delivering on the opportunity in front of us. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. \nGlenn Schorr: So I like hearing about all the progress in the wealth channel. My question is, in the asset management segment, non-comp was higher. One of the things you noted in the footnote was higher placement fees, so good expenses. \n So I'm just curious, obviously, that's included in your 15% to 20% FRE thoughts for the year. But I've been hearing some talk about moving -- some of the distributors want to move from placement fees to something smoother of a revenue share. And I'm curious if that's in motion and if that's part of your thought process within your FRE expectations. \nMartin Kelly: I'd say -- I can say a couple of things, Glenn. It's Martin. Firstly, we are -- we're at the back end of the financial impact of decisions we've made to reset our cost base, both comp and non-comp. And so you should expect that Q1, which was a step-up from Q4, represents normal going forward. And so -- and that's all consistent with the guidance for the year, which is 100 basis points of margin expansion, '24 over '23. \n In terms of the specifics around the question, there are actually a variety of different ways that we distribute products. Some involve an upfront placement fee, which is typically expense and in the numbers. Others involve a trailer fee against revenues. So it's a mix actually depending on distributor and product. \n And so there's no real change. It's just there's different constructs that are appropriate for different products. And we have products that distribute using each of these sort of trailer or cost structures. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: I was hoping we could start maybe with your outlook for third-party fundraising. You guys are obviously off to a really good start here in the first quarter. So maybe update us on what you're expecting for the rest of the year with respect to third-party fundraising. What are some of the key drivers behind that? And as you sort of think about some of these larger insurance companies coming in into your offering, how should we be thinking about the fee rate, particularly within the yield bucket, on the blended basis going forward? \nJames Zelter: Thanks, Alex. I think Marc and Martin hit it. Like we think the first quarter, it sets the level for great trend growth throughout the year. We're very comfortable that what we've seen in terms of the last 24 months, bringing the products together, being very thoughtful about our product suite, really delivering a holistic package. So we're very comfortable taking the first quarter and looking at that as the year grows out. \n So in our mind, the numbers we've put forth in terms of full year target of the $50 billion, we still feel very comfortable with that. And the traction across all of our channels would feel -- give us the great comfort. \n Certainly, a lot of the conversations are going on around the yield businesses. And whether it's what we're doing in direct origination, the pioneer moves we're making in asset-based finance, Marc alluded to the insurance company in terms of the ecosystem and the broad breadth there. So in our simple summary, we love the trend. And we're hitting on all cylinders, and it's across products. \n But certainly, yield is the primary, but we also have solid fundraising in a variety of our hybrid, whether it's the Accord Plus; whether it's HVF later in the year; or in our equity businesses, AAA and infrastructure and such. So feel very comfortable with the trend, feel very comfortable. The themes that we're seeing are strong. \n And I think there's this -- in the industry, and Marc alluded to it, but just much, much greater cooperation across a variety of like-minded positioned investors in the insurance industry as well as in the banking business, which we can talk about. \n Fees, we're not seeing fee compression. People want product. They see it's interesting. If you look at where the high-yield indexes are this morning as we have this call, basically, if you look where those levels are today, they're extremely tight. And if you look at where high yield is right now, it's basically 350 over. And for you to make these investment-grade investments for these insurance portfolios, 250, 300 over, it's incredibly attractive. \n So we don't see fee pressure, we see a trend line growth, and we're comfortable with the pipeline. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS. \nBrennan Hawken: I'd love to hear updated outlook on capital solutions. Really strong revenue momentum there, building on last year's strengths. So were there any particular platforms that were notable contributors? And given the building momentum behind capital markets activity, why shouldn't we see those revenues continue to show robust growth? \nJames Zelter: Well, this is Jim again. I think there's a number of questions there. We do get excited about our capital solutions because it ties into not only distribution of great ideas, and as Marc said, 25% of everything and 100% of nothing, but it increases the dialogue that we have in our capital formation. Investors see the product that they're seeing from us and it opens the door to get closer. And again, so we're seeing momentum. \n I think taking a broad step back, some of the themes that Marc talked about, whether it's not only it's the transition from equity that's private versus private equity, a variety of these asset-based solutions like the seller financing from UBS, these are all trends that we believe are going to continue to expand on the existing business. \n And then when you think about what's going on domestically with large, whether it's the Infrastructure Act, the CHIPS Act, what's going on in EV, there are many, many investment-grade companies that are going to be confronted with massive growth initiatives. And it's not obvious that they should do it through the traditional channels of investment-grade public debt or equity. And we're just finding ourselves at the intersection of those conversations. Certainly, you've seen what's happened in the past several months with what we did for Air France and Vonovia and many other companies. \n But again, our model is based on making sure that we are an investor first. But this ACS, the flywheel of origination, distribution, getting closer to your clients and then finding new avenues from which companies will fund and finance, that flywheel is working. And so while we do expect growth, we want to do it in a very measured manner. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Bill Katz of TD Cowen. \nWilliam Katz: Look forward to seeing everybody in October, if not sooner. So Marc, not to steal any thunder from a couple of months from now. But when you laid out your goals for the sort of 15% to 20% FRE growth and the low double-digit growth for SRE, your flywheel that Jim was just talking about was substantially smaller. How do we triangulate between the sort of the rapid growth of your ecosystem to the financials in terms of thinking through the earnings growth? \n It would seem to me that you should be able to support either or both faster asset management growth and/or higher ROE in the insurance business. Or is there an elevated expense offset to some of that flywheel acceleration? \nMarc Rowan: I don't -- thanks for the question. I don't think any of the above. I want to come back to and I guess maybe be a little bit of an outlook for the industry. Our industry has amazing potential. The case for private markets is a very compelling case. People used to look to private markets for excess return. Now they look to excess -- to private markets for both excess return and diversification. \n I saw a note the other day from our Chief Economist, better than 80% of employment in the U.S. is in private markets. We think about S&P 500. We think about public markets. We spend so much time talking about them. But investors increasingly are now recognizing that they have exposure to a very small sliver of the economy through S&P 500. They're all -- my joke is they're all levered to NVIDIA, Apple and Amazon. \n So I expect there to be very robust growth in private markets. All good. The lockdown -- we, as an industry, have to be very careful to stick to our promise of excess return per unit of risk. That is why investors pay us premium fees. That is why they trust us. This is how they navigate private markets, with firms they trust. \n We are limited, and I believe we will all in the industry discover, we are not going to be limited by capital flows. But the taking of capital because you can take it and then investing it poorly is a quick way to destroy a business. I think we've seen lots of examples of that and the beginnings of those seeds being set. We are very focused on growing our business in the context of excess return per unit of risk, which is limited, in my opinion, by origination and by culture. We are balancing those two things. \n And so -- well, I'll say it differently. I like the position we're in. To be a $670 billion asset manager sounds like a big number, but the reality is, in the scheme of the markets we serve, we're minimal. The notion of doubling our business over the next 5 years, it doesn't seem all that daunting. \n The things we need to do: Origination, culture, education because to build something that's not sustainable is not what we're interested in doing. Sustainable, predictable, 15% to 20%; long term in the asset management business; low double digits in SRE. If we get periods of market volatility where things are really mispriced and we can put large amounts of capital to work, as historically we've seen at least once a decade if not twice a decade over the past few decades, you will see those accelerate. Origination, origination, origination for us. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Ben Budish of Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: I wanted to ask about some of the nuances on the retirement services flows. It looks like your FABN issuance was a bit better than what we would have expected from what we saw publicly. The PRT side was a little bit lower. Just any nuances there. \n And on the PRT side in particular, any concerns related to some of the shareholder lawsuits that have materialized in the last several months? Do you think that sort of increases the concern that a corporate might give some pause before engaging in a transaction with Athene? Or do you feel like this is something that will blow over, and Athene will shake out just fine? \nMarc Rowan: Thanks, Ben. It's Marc. The business is a 2-sided business, and I've said this a lot. And it's -- we've been the only ones disclosing this. So it's been difficult, I believe, for analysts to really understand it. \n Our business is about creating spread. If we don't have wide spreads, we're not interested in doing business. We have better uses for the capital. And so we have built, and Jim has spent a lot of time talking about the asset pipeline, private investment grade, excess spread on the asset side. I'll focus now on the liability side and get to your question. \n We have built, over the past 15 years 4, different channels in which we can originate. In various periods of time, some of those channels are really attractive and some of them are not that attractive. Last year, FABN was not all that attractive. This year, FABN is very attractive. Reinsurance, particularly international insurance in -- from Japan, really attractive business. FIA, really attractive business. \n In PRT, PRT was one of the most attractive segments of business last year. This year, prior to any lawsuits, we saw cost of funds associated with PRT at levels that reduced spread to places where we just didn't think the business was all that attractive. A win is only a win if you have wide spread. \n The lawsuit is actually going to, in my opinion, chill PRT volume across the industry. This is not an Athene-specific issue. Athene is the strongest of the companies in the industry with the most capital and other things. There are and have been other lawsuits relating to this. Any time you have noise, however undeserved or poorly drafted, it needs to be disposed of first. \n I think we will see a decline in expected PRT volume this year. I'm not sure that's a bad thing from our point of view given that, at the moment, spreads in PRT are not all that attractive. \n I encourage all of you to look not so much at flow, but to look at cost of funds and spread. Cost of funds is a very tricky measure. There are lots of ways management teams across industries have been surprised by the cost of various options and features that they have built into their products. \n For us, we have built this business in partnership with Jim Belardi and Grant and the team from the very get-go. As owners, for owners, it's our equity. We want high-spread business. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. \nPatrick Davitt: My question is on the ATLAS-MassMutual partnership. Firstly, any framework you can give on how to think about the impact on ATLAS' origination volumes and thus Apollo earnings? \n And then secondly, the press release suggested there was also some sort of separate flow or management agreement with your ABF business. Is that a fair read? And how should we think about that secondary agreement as well? \nMarc Rowan: So first, I've said this publicly, and it's actually kind of an interesting observation for how this goes. I think when I think -- I'm asked often who our best competitors are, I think MassMutual is our best competitor. I look at what they do on the asset side. I look at their -- on the liability side, the quality of the team. \n That does not in any way mean that we should not be partners with them. We want and we continue to deliver this message, and it is resonating. We want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. They are a like-minded, high-quality financial institution who sees the same opportunity that we see and increasingly what the rest of the industry is seeing. They're just among the first movers. \n As to the specifics for ATLAS, I'll let Jim delve a little bit. And I know there's a lot of enthusiasm about ATLAS. \nJames Zelter: Yes. I think continuing to taking the wide scope and then drilling down, I mean, ATLAS for us and this conversation about what private credit is historically been defined versus what it really is defined, the $40 trillion, ATLAS is really that platform, of our 16, we've got 6 or 7 that really drive the activity. And what you're seeing in the recent announcements about ATLAS is it is a finance lender to finance companies. And therefore, the breadth and scale of equity and debt financing that, that vehicle attracts and needs to have, as well as SMAs, partnerships, offtake facilities, that's what we call the ATLAS ecosystem. \n And it will continue to grow. We've been very successful since we've closed it. It's fully ramped. It's fully funded. We will have other folks that you'll hear about be coming into us. But it's that flow that lets us have the ABF institutional fund. It allows us to have ABC, which is the vehicle that I mentioned. \n And I really want to differentiate because I heard a lot of these calls the last couple of days talking about SRT. This is just making sure that we control the origination on a systematic, structural long-term basis. Not a one-off SRT trade, which is interesting and bespoke, but those were interesting tactical trades. We wake up every day saying, how can we -- when Marc talks about getting the liability and focusing on spread, how can we ensure that we have as large a pool of long-term assets feeding that -- those liabilities, offsetting those liabilities. \n And ATLAS is just one of the big, big pieces. And when we think about that, it's much more dramatic than the quarter-to-quarter activity in SRT trade, which is one of the 40 tools. We're very involved in that sector. We've been doing it since '09. Some of the more recent transactions are a little bit [ blind ] pool, exceedingly strongly levered, but they are strong IG assets. But again, I would note, those are things that you source from others, whereas ATLAS allows us to source directly. \n So the MassMutual dialogue and relationship is holistic. It's across the ecosystem. And we suspect that will be the template from which many, many others join us. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: I wanted to circle back to the new Apollo asset-backed company, ABC, that you guys are launching. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on the product, the return profile. Interesting, you're structuring as an operating company. I hope you could elaborate a bit around that. And maybe just talk about your vision and how big could this be over time. \nJames Zelter: Well, really, Mike, when we think about the activities in terms of consumer finance, hard assets, the broad areas of asset-based finance, this is the vehicle that lets us -- we have the institutional product, ABF, which we've raised some nice money and will continue to be one of our flagship pillars in the yield and credit infrastructure. \n And this was created to really give the global wealth channels -- as investors have really grasped onto private credit, they realize they have a concentration issue in sponsor buyout activity. Now that's the recognition that there's a desire for diversification. So this will really be the first-mover product set. \n You will see this as a majority of investment-grade risk, a majority of debt risk, but yet it does have some non-investment-grade debt exposure and some residual and equity exposures. But we are trying to have this be like ADS, our flagship product, that operates in the highest-quality growth in the sector and really is trying to get high single digits, low double-digit returns, but doing so in a very comprehensive manner by not using leverage but being -- really using the sourcing of the product. \n So it will be our flagship product in asset-based as ADS is our flagship product in corporate credit. \nMarc Rowan: Yes. I'm going to just punctuate this a little bit, especially given the environment we're in and the concerns over credit quality. We've been in this business a long time. And for me, this is -- for Jim and I, it's our 40th year. It's hard to believe that sometimes. \n And I'll just take ADS as an example. We run ADS at 100% first lien. And we run ADS, I believe, with the lowest leverage in the industry. Could we produce higher rate of return, higher dividend? Of course we could. But we know that particularly as we're introducing an entire marketplace, institutional and retail, to the notion of private markets, that they should experience the same way -- this is the same way that the smartest institutions in the world have experienced it and not have returns artificially manufactured through leverage or otherwise. The time to be levered is when assets are really cheap and they're plentiful and available. The time not to be levered is when markets are tight and there's lots of liquidity. \n It's easy to be seduced into wanting to produce high returns. We've always been focused on trying to produce acceptable returns, excess return per unit of risk. And the same philosophy that we run ADS and the team runs ADS by is how we're going to produce this in asset-backed to make sure this category, which should be as large as corporate over time, is introduced to investors in the best possible way. And going first and telling the story is exactly what we want to do. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Kenneth Worthington of JPMorgan Chase. \nAlexander Bernstein: This is Alex Bernstein on for Ken. I know there was a question previously around ATLAS and the MassMu relationship, so apologies if any of this is repetitive. But I do think there are a couple of other points we're hoping to dry out. \n Firstly, do you see this type of arrangement accelerating your ability to reach the $200 billion to $250 billion long-term origination target that you communicated previously? And then secondly, how are you managing these platforms as a portfolio to reach your goals? And how are you thinking about the mix of outside capital, Apollo Capital, bolt-ons that best help you reach your growth goals and those of Athene? \nJames Zelter: Well, thanks for the question. This will be a great conversation at our October day. But basically, we have these 16 platforms. The top 5 to 7, namely MidCap, ATLAS, PK, Wheels are the great drivers. And yes, as we think about running those as a portfolio, optimizing the financing on those and bringing in third parties, whether it's in SMAs on the production side, or even in many instances where we brought in investors to own the equity along with us, that's all part of the flywheel. \n So certainly, we think that when we look at what's going on with our platforms and with bringing this integrated toolbox to -- solutions to companies, we think that gives us the confidence to take our numbers up from our 5-year plan. And so as Marc said, when we did our first Investor Day, it was $150 billion in debt by '26. We'll achieve that. But we've sort of now changed the definition of the equity and hybrid. \n So in our mind, hitting those $200 billion-plus numbers, the driver really will be how we integrate those platforms. And again, how investors deal with us, whether it's an SMA, whether it's a commingle vehicle, whether it's owning part of the equity, it's all part of the same equation. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will return the floor to Noah Gunn for any additional or closing comments. \nNoah Gunn: Great. Thanks, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. If you have any follow-up questions on anything we discussed on today's call, please feel free to follow up with us. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event.

            "name": "Martin Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me close out with some brief comments on our financial performance. Our first quarter results positioned us well to deliver on the financial targets we've communicated for 2024, which signal an attractive mid-teens earnings growth trajectory.\n We view the sustainability and predictability of our earnings profile as highly valuable and increasingly appreciated by the market, especially against the backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty that has impacted more cyclical revenue streams. \n Starting with the asset management side of the business. FRE trends remained solid with 16% growth year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth of 13% and cost growth of 9%. As we look towards the remainder of the year, we're on pace to generate the fee-related revenue growth, margin expansion and overall FRE dollar growth we have indicated. \n We expect growth in fee revenue to be supported by strong and diversified capital formation, a record $50 billion of dry powder with future management fee potential, and a robust capital solutions outlook that should deliver a strong second and third quarter based on the pipeline we see today. \n For expenses, we will continue to manage our cost base prudently while selectively investing in key areas, principally global wealth and our credit business. We also expect to recognize a $15 million onetime non-comp expense related to the previously announced merger of two closed-end funds with and into MidCap Financial Investment Corp., a publicly traded BDC we manage, which will most likely occur in the second quarter on the closing of these transactions and which was contemplated in our original expense growth guidance for the year. \n Altogether, we expect to generate between 15% and 20% FRE growth, as Marc indicated, in line with our growth expectations for a year in which we do not raise a flagship PE fund. \n Turning to Retirement Services. We reported SRE of $817 million at a 147 basis point net spread. Adjusting for long-term expectations for alternative returns, net spread would have been 10 basis points higher in the first quarter; and on a comparable basis, 9 basis points lower than fourth quarter levels. \n This sequential decline was driven by 2 factors; One, higher on the margin cost of new business in the higher interest rate environment, together with the delayed deployment into higher-yielding assets that Marc highlighted; and two, an approximate 5 basis point in-quarter spread impact associated with hedging a portion of Athene's net floating rate position and higher hedging costs on certain in-force business. \n As Marc suggested, we reduced the net floating rate portfolio by $9 billion to $16 billion during the first quarter, which results in 7% of net invested assets being subject to floating rate indices. As part of this hedging effort, we swapped $8 billion of fixed rate liabilities to floating and issued $4 billion of additional floating rate funding agreements with the negative carry associated with each recognized as part of our cost of funds in the quarter. We believe that this level of floating rate securities will adequately equip us from a strategic standpoint while also protecting future earnings power should rates decline materially. \n Given the smaller portfolio size, our floating rate income sensitivity has commensurately decreased to approximately $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE for every 25 basis point move in short-term rates, down from the $45 million to $55 million that we previously indicated. \n We expect the timing differential between origination and deployment of capital to normalize through net spread in coming quarters. More specifically, there were two large asset transactions that closed towards the end of March which, had they closed midway through the quarter, would have created a further 3 basis points of higher net spread in quarter. \n Considering key components of Athene's earnings growth outlook versus our fourth quarter call, namely first quarter net spread results, a smaller floating rate portfolio and fewer expected rate cuts as implied by the forward curve, we continue to expect net spread of approximately 160 to 165 basis points for the full year, which excludes notable items and assumes an 11% annualized alts return. We expect this range of net spread, coupled with robust organic growth, to support low double-digit SRE growth this year versus the comparable 2023 base. \n In -- turning to PII. PII has been an expectedly modest contributor to our earnings base in recent quarters as we await a more favorable backdrop to monetize investments. First quarter realized performance fees were also impacted by an impairment on a position held in Fund IX. Looking to the second quarter, we currently expect to generate a similar amount of PII as the first quarter. \n An important catalyst to reignite realization activity is a reopening of the IPO market as only around 10% of our fund's total PE portfolio is publicly traded today. We've seen early signs of this happening and see a path for an acceleration in PE realizations into 2025 and beyond. Increasing amounts of realized carry would generate additional cash flow to deploy into opportunistic share repurchases, enabling us to execute on our plan to reduce our share count to approximately 600 million shares by the end of 2026. \n Finally, on taxes. After a large non-recurring benefit in the prior quarter, which reduced the 2023 annual rate, we experienced a 17% effective tax rate in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 20%, consistent with our long-term guidance with a rate slightly above 20% expected in the second quarter. \n In closing, we are generating significant momentum as we continue executing on our business plan, which is setting the stage for our next phase of growth. The earnings power of the business has tremendous potential, and we look forward to delivering on the opportunity in front of us. \n And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. I'd say -- I can say a couple of things, Glenn. It's Martin. Firstly, we are -- we're at the back end of the financial impact of decisions we've made to reset our cost base, both comp and non-comp. And so you should expect that Q1, which was a step-up from Q4, represents normal going forward. And so -- and that's all consistent with the guidance for the year, which is 100 basis points of margin expansion, '24 over '23. \n In terms of the specifics around the question, there are actually a variety of different ways that we distribute products. Some involve an upfront placement fee, which is typically expense and in the numbers. Others involve a trailer fee against revenues. So it's a mix actually depending on distributor and product. \n And so there's no real change. It's just there's different constructs that are appropriate for different products. And we have products that distribute using each of these sort of trailer or cost structures."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Marc. Let me dive into a few more details. The foundation of our business is built upon delivering strong investment returns for our clients. And we have historically done so by upholding a purchase price matters investment philosophy across market cycles and strategies, which embrace downside protection structure in return for excess return per unit of risk. \n Most recently, the industry has evolved into a paradigm marked by higher for longer rates, tighter spreads and extreme valuations, and we've responded accordingly. Over the last several quarters, we focused on larger companies and transactions at the top of the capital structure while employing less leverage than others in the industry. \n Marc mentioned the ADS, Apollo Debt Solutions. There's a great example of that, where we produced a 14.5% return over the last year but a conservatively levered balance sheet of 0.6 with a 100% corporate loan portfolio. \n Additionally, we continue to generate meaningful excess return in this intersection of equity and credit, which we define as hybrid, driven by a variety of structural changes and inefficiencies in the market. Our 2 flagship strategies in this area, the Accord series and the Hybrid Value series, have generated particularly strong returns, appreciating 4% in the first quarter and more than 16% over the last year. \n Alongside investment performance, capital formation is a critical driver of our growth. We generated strong inflows across the business in the first quarter, as Marc highlighted, including $20 billion from our asset management business and $20 billion from Athene. And organic inflows, excluding any leverage or segment transfers, totaled $33 billion, which is on track with our $120 billion target for the year. \n Double-clicking on this third-party fundraising. Credit-oriented strategies were very much in focus and accounted for more than 80% of capital raised in the quarter. Some of the more significant contributors included $3 billion to broadly support the growth of the Atlas ecosystem, $3 billion for high-grade alpha separately managed accounts, $2 billion for large-cap direct lending and our recently launched asset-based -- asset-backed finance fund. \n As Marc mentioned, it is worth double-clicking on the fact that we've raised $6.5 billion of the capital from third-party insurers, reflecting the significant roads -- inroads we've made in this important growth area over the last handful of years. We're focused on delivering strategies that sit at the intersection of Athene's unique SRE playbook and Apollo's broad asset management capabilities, namely investment-grade private credit, which we believe is ideally suited for these insurance company investment portfolios. \n To illustrate the scale of our alpha-generating capabilities, we've originated close to $80 billion of assets through platforms and corporate solutions over the last 12 months, which has generated between 150 and 200 basis points of excess spread versus comparatively rated liquid credits. As we continue to grow in these debt origination capabilities, we expect there will be growing interest from third-party insurers to invest alongside in the full spectrum of our ecosystem, a dynamic we've started to see. And all this works because of our alignment with Athene, which is critical to our value proposition. \n Moving on to global wealth, which is a strategic and growing contributor of our capital formation activity. Our journey in building out this business, we've realized there are 5 crucial components in order to succeed: Investment performance, education, distribution capabilities, technology and a diversified product list, all of which we've successfully established over the last 24 months. \n We believe that only a small group of firms can deliver on all 5. And with continued strategic focus and investment, we see ourselves among the best positioned for long-term success. The numbers bear this out as we've more than doubled our run rate fundraising level with our holistic suite of products. Monthly inflows approached $1 billion in April, a meaningful increase from approximately $650 million just a quarter ago and less than $400 million a year ago. \n As I mentioned, one of the primary drivers of this activity has been our flagship corporate direct lending offering, ADS. April subscriptions totaled over $500 million, bringing year-to-date subscriptions to approximately $1.7 billion. And this represents approximately a 400% increase in flows year-to-date compared to last year. \n Part of the step-up reflects recent market share gains in the non-traded BDC space with ADS capturing 17% of total inflows in 2024 so far compared to only 10% at the run rate in the fourth quarter. This overall growth has been enabled by leading investment performance combined with our expanding distribution footprint and attractive yield. \n The next step in the expansion of our credit-focused product set within global wealth channel, we're on track to launch a new asset-backed finance vehicle in the coming weeks. Apollo asset-backed credit company, or ABC, is a semiliquid turnkey solution designed to provide our credit investors across our differentiating -- to access our differentiated origination capabilities and builds on the initial traction we've seen in our broader asset-backed franchise. \n We believe the breadth and scale of our proprietary origination ecosystem, not just for sourcing from Wall Street, will position us to be a market leader in this nascent and important growth area of the global wealth market. Importantly, we structured ABC as an operating company, enabling us to access our full range of origination capabilities versus other traditional private credit structures. \n And finally, Apollo Aligned Alternatives, better known as AAA, is our semiliquid equity replacement strategy, continues to be an important part of our global wealth offering. We raised $700 million of capital in the first quarter and continue to see strong fundraising momentum. \n We have a pipeline of new distribution partners preparing to launch the fund over the next course of the year. And interestingly, we're also seeing growing interest from the consultant community and insurance companies as a cost-effective, scaled solution for private markets exposure. \n Stepping back for a moment. We've observed that many in our industry have discovered the language of origination. As a result, our definition of fixed income replacement and private credit, a $40 trillion addressable market, has become mainstream and distinct from the traditional view of private credit. We were pioneers of these concepts 36 months ago and expect to continue blazing the path forward for this important area of secular growth. \n As part of that, scaling our debt origination volume production is a strategic focus, and our quarterly results highlight that we're continuing to make meaningful progress. As Marc mentioned, total debt origination volumes of nearly $120 billion over the last 12 months is up almost 40% compared with our prior year period. \n As a reminder, we originate assets across our yield ecosystem through three main channels: The traditional channel, platforms and corporate solutions. And more recently, we've identified partnerships with other financial institutions as the fourth avenue that we plan to expand over time. Additionally, we have expanded our focus on a fifth leg, the broad equity and hybrid ecosystem as well, which you will hear more from us in the future. \n Over the past year, our platform ecosystem has been the primary driver of origination growth, having roughly doubled volume production over that period. ATLAS SP, our warehouse finance and securitized products business, has been the major driver of that activity. \n One notable win to highlight in the first quarter was the $8 billion purchase of seller financing facilities from UBS. We acquired this portfolio at an attractive excess spread for IG-equivalent risk, which also proved accretive and attractive to third-party investors as we materially oversubscribed on half the trade and distributed accordingly. Looking forward, with the ATLAS business fully operational, independent and armed with a significant amount of strategic capital, both debt and equity, we're focused on meaningfully scaling that platform. \n While platforms are an essential component of our origination ecosystem, we're also highly focused on growing our corporate solutions platform and business. We're investing a tremendous amount of time with a broad array of the largest, most sophisticated companies to educate them on the benefits of our multifaceted credit toolkit or toolbox and the benefits it can provide, namely speed, certainty, size and customization. And we're beginning to see those efforts bear tremendous fruit. \n And finally, we believe that partnerships will become a growing contributor of our origination capacity over time. Historically, and especially over the last several years, we believe we've been on the cutting edge of strategic dialogue with various financial institutions. We're seeking to extend our vast array of solutions to these firms in a partnership manner which in turn will help expand our platform. \n Importantly, as we scale our debt origination capacity and expand newer areas of equity-focused investing, we're creating more consistent and diversified deal activity that feeds into our Capital Solutions business. While quarterly variability in fee revenue should be expected, we're observing that the business is reaching a point of consistency amid continued growth potential. In the first quarter specifically, Capital Solutions fees were solid, supported by record quarterly gross capital deployment of nearly $60 billion across the platform. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Martin for more detail. Thanks, Alex. I think Marc and Martin hit it. Like we think the first quarter, it sets the level for great trend growth throughout the year. We're very comfortable that what we've seen in terms of the last 24 months, bringing the products together, being very thoughtful about our product suite, really delivering a holistic package. So we're very comfortable taking the first quarter and looking at that as the year grows out. \n So in our mind, the numbers we've put forth in terms of full year target of the $50 billion, we still feel very comfortable with that. And the traction across all of our channels would feel -- give us the great comfort. \n Certainly, a lot of the conversations are going on around the yield businesses. And whether it's what we're doing in direct origination, the pioneer moves we're making in asset-based finance, Marc alluded to the insurance company in terms of the ecosystem and the broad breadth there. So in our simple summary, we love the trend. And we're hitting on all cylinders, and it's across products. \n But certainly, yield is the primary, but we also have solid fundraising in a variety of our hybrid, whether it's the Accord Plus; whether it's HVF later in the year; or in our equity businesses, AAA and infrastructure and such. So feel very comfortable with the trend, feel very comfortable. The themes that we're seeing are strong. \n And I think there's this -- in the industry, and Marc alluded to it, but just much, much greater cooperation across a variety of like-minded positioned investors in the insurance industry as well as in the banking business, which we can talk about. \n Fees, we're not seeing fee compression. People want product. They see it's interesting. If you look at where the high-yield indexes are this morning as we have this call, basically, if you look where those levels are today, they're extremely tight. And if you look at where high yield is right now, it's basically 350 over. And for you to make these investment-grade investments for these insurance portfolios, 250, 300 over, it's incredibly attractive. \n So we don't see fee pressure, we see a trend line growth, and we're comfortable with the pipeline. Well, this is Jim again. I think there's a number of questions there. We do get excited about our capital solutions because it ties into not only distribution of great ideas, and as Marc said, 25% of everything and 100% of nothing, but it increases the dialogue that we have in our capital formation. Investors see the product that they're seeing from us and it opens the door to get closer. And again, so we're seeing momentum. \n I think taking a broad step back, some of the themes that Marc talked about, whether it's not only it's the transition from equity that's private versus private equity, a variety of these asset-based solutions like the seller financing from UBS, these are all trends that we believe are going to continue to expand on the existing business. \n And then when you think about what's going on domestically with large, whether it's the Infrastructure Act, the CHIPS Act, what's going on in EV, there are many, many investment-grade companies that are going to be confronted with massive growth initiatives. And it's not obvious that they should do it through the traditional channels of investment-grade public debt or equity. And we're just finding ourselves at the intersection of those conversations. Certainly, you've seen what's happened in the past several months with what we did for Air France and Vonovia and many other companies. \n But again, our model is based on making sure that we are an investor first. But this ACS, the flywheel of origination, distribution, getting closer to your clients and then finding new avenues from which companies will fund and finance, that flywheel is working. And so while we do expect growth, we want to do it in a very measured manner. Yes. I think continuing to taking the wide scope and then drilling down, I mean, ATLAS for us and this conversation about what private credit is historically been defined versus what it really is defined, the $40 trillion, ATLAS is really that platform, of our 16, we've got 6 or 7 that really drive the activity. And what you're seeing in the recent announcements about ATLAS is it is a finance lender to finance companies. And therefore, the breadth and scale of equity and debt financing that, that vehicle attracts and needs to have, as well as SMAs, partnerships, offtake facilities, that's what we call the ATLAS ecosystem. \n And it will continue to grow. We've been very successful since we've closed it. It's fully ramped. It's fully funded. We will have other folks that you'll hear about be coming into us. But it's that flow that lets us have the ABF institutional fund. It allows us to have ABC, which is the vehicle that I mentioned. \n And I really want to differentiate because I heard a lot of these calls the last couple of days talking about SRT. This is just making sure that we control the origination on a systematic, structural long-term basis. Not a one-off SRT trade, which is interesting and bespoke, but those were interesting tactical trades. We wake up every day saying, how can we -- when Marc talks about getting the liability and focusing on spread, how can we ensure that we have as large a pool of long-term assets feeding that -- those liabilities, offsetting those liabilities. \n And ATLAS is just one of the big, big pieces. And when we think about that, it's much more dramatic than the quarter-to-quarter activity in SRT trade, which is one of the 40 tools. We're very involved in that sector. We've been doing it since '09. Some of the more recent transactions are a little bit [ blind ] pool, exceedingly strongly levered, but they are strong IG assets. But again, I would note, those are things that you source from others, whereas ATLAS allows us to source directly. \n So the MassMutual dialogue and relationship is holistic. It's across the ecosystem. And we suspect that will be the template from which many, many others join us. Well, really, Mike, when we think about the activities in terms of consumer finance, hard assets, the broad areas of asset-based finance, this is the vehicle that lets us -- we have the institutional product, ABF, which we've raised some nice money and will continue to be one of our flagship pillars in the yield and credit infrastructure. \n And this was created to really give the global wealth channels -- as investors have really grasped onto private credit, they realize they have a concentration issue in sponsor buyout activity. Now that's the recognition that there's a desire for diversification. So this will really be the first-mover product set. \n You will see this as a majority of investment-grade risk, a majority of debt risk, but yet it does have some non-investment-grade debt exposure and some residual and equity exposures. But we are trying to have this be like ADS, our flagship product, that operates in the highest-quality growth in the sector and really is trying to get high single digits, low double-digit returns, but doing so in a very comprehensive manner by not using leverage but being -- really using the sourcing of the product. \n So it will be our flagship product in asset-based as ADS is our flagship product in corporate credit. Well, thanks for the question. This will be a great conversation at our October day. But basically, we have these 16 platforms. The top 5 to 7, namely MidCap, ATLAS, PK, Wheels are the great drivers. And yes, as we think about running those as a portfolio, optimizing the financing on those and bringing in third parties, whether it's in SMAs on the production side, or even in many instances where we brought in investors to own the equity along with us, that's all part of the flywheel. \n So certainly, we think that when we look at what's going on with our platforms and with bringing this integrated toolbox to -- solutions to companies, we think that gives us the confidence to take our numbers up from our 5-year plan. And so as Marc said, when we did our first Investor Day, it was $150 billion in debt by '26. We'll achieve that. But we've sort of now changed the definition of the equity and hybrid. \n So in our mind, hitting those $200 billion-plus numbers, the driver really will be how we integrate those platforms. And again, how investors deal with us, whether it's an SMA, whether it's a commingle vehicle, whether it's owning part of the equity, it's all part of the same equation."

            "name": "Marc Rowan",
            "content": "Thank you, Noah, and good morning. As Noah detailed, first quarter results were strong. Personally, I was very pleased. FRE was $462 million, up 16% year-over-year. And you will hear a little bit from me but mostly from Jim, there is momentum in every part of the business. For SRE, we reported $817 million, up 19% year-over-year. Key note for the quarter, a record inflow of $20 billion for the quarter. \n I'm going to spend some time providing color on the quarter but then quickly move to the outlook for the year. In the quarter, particularly with respect to SRE, we had 3 things going on. The first, really good. The team generated, as I suggested, $20 billion of inflows diversified across their funding channels, particularly three of their funding channels. \n While they generated what they needed to, and origination, as you will hear, was very strong, they were somewhat mixed in terms of timing. The generation of liabilities took place at a relatively even pace, whereas most of the origination was back-end loaded, resulting in higher cash balances for the quarter, which we expect to even out across the year. The second, alternatives had a slight underperformance versus what we historically have normalized or come to expect had normalized. \n But the biggest action in the quarter was our move to significantly derisk the floating rate book. Recall that we run a common sense strategy. When rates are very low, we have been able to earn very nice rates of return without maximizing current period SRE and putting on significant floating rate exposure, which gives us upside as rates normalize. You should expect, as rates have returned to more normalized levels, we use this as an opportunity to significantly reduce our exposure. \n Exposure now is about $16 billion, probably where we're going to leave it for the near term. Sensitivity of 100 basis points move at floaters at this point is less than 5% of SRE. You should expect us to continue to move floating rate exposure up and down, reflecting first, the nature of our business; and the fact that we do not have -- while on the upside, we have linear participation in rates, on the downside, we do not have linear participation in rate falls. And second, there is a nice hedging element to having a certain amount of floating rate exposure vis-a-vis performance of liabilities during changes of interest rates. \n All in all, a really strong quarter and one that gives me increased confidence that the outlook that we sketched out for all of you coming into this year will be met. I view this as on-trend. \n FRE, we're expecting 15% to 20% growth in our -- in the non-flagship PE year versus the 25% we grew in '23. We have plenty of opportunities to invest in the business. And the trade-off as to where we end up between 15% and 20% will be, in my opinion, based on how much we choose to invest in the future. \n SRE, we are targeting low double-digit growth, which we believe reflects the long-term run rate growth rate of our Retirement Services business. We do expect to still meet or exceed the $70 billion of organic inflows in 2024. \n If I were to highlight momentum in the business, I'll pick out the 2 or 3 things that I think are really exceptional. The first, the lifeblood of our business is origination. $40 billion of originations for the quarter, roughly half from our platforms. Platforms, as you recall, are unique to Apollo and represent a recurring and enduring and growing source of origination. We, in my opinion, can only grow as fast as we can originate assets that provide excess return per unit of risk, and this is a significant focus for the firm. \n Capital formation was also very strong for the quarter. Before I touch on the numbers, I'll touch on the philosophy. Capital formation is an important part of our business, but we have to be very careful to be measured in capital formation and not simply accept money at all costs at all times. We need to invest it prudently, particularly in new and growing segments where we are building investor trust. \n For the quarter, capital formation was $40 billion, roughly $20 billion coming from Retirement Services and $20 billion coming from asset management. In the asset management business, there was a lot of momentum in global wealth, in particular, very strong performance at ADS. Recall that ADS is our 100% first lien, lowest leverage, run defensively, direct lending business. The team there has done a spectacular job. \n There's also momentum in institutional. I'd pick out asset-based finance and third-party insurance as highlights for the quarter. Asset-backed finance is directly tied to our capacity to originate as many of the products that come off our platforms end up or are consumed in asset-backed form. \n It is also tied to our philosophy of wanting 25% of everything and 100% of nothing, which produces unique alignment with our third-party insurance and third-party institutional and other clients. ABF is particularly well suited to insurance company balance sheets. There were $8 billion of ABF flows in Q1, including a multibillion dollar strategic investment from a like-minded leading financial institution. \n In summary, momentum has been building in the quarter. And I believe we are set for and on track, consistent with guidance here. While this year is interesting, and Noah has already highlighted our Investor Day, share with you how the team thinks about the future. \n We are in a really exciting industry. The two big pillars of growth that we see ahead of us are first, retirement. Like it or not, we're all getting older. The need for guaranteed lifetime income, guaranteed retirement income everywhere in the world exceeds what is currently provided. Whether you look at aging of population, whether you look at the decline of defined benefit plans, whether you look at the inadequacy or lack of preparation of governments around the world, I continue to believe that retirement is going to be a massive driver of our business. Retirement is ultimately built on a foundation of fixed income. \n The second and perhaps bigger trend in our business is a wholesale revisiting by investors of the ABCs of portfolio construction. And when I say investors, I mean institutions and individuals. We are an industry that has been built out of the smallest asset allocation of our institutional clients. \n In a very simple way, I think of our institutional clients as being primarily allocated, at least half to publicly traded equities; 30% allocated to publicly traded fixed income; and 20% allocated to everything else, meaning alternatives. Our entire industry growth has been out of that 20% bucket. \n 20% is the so-called private or alternative bucket made sense in a world where private was risky and public was safe. I believe we are revisiting the most fundamental concepts that underlie our financial markets. Private now goes from AA to levered equity; and public, which was 8,000 public companies, there's now 4,000 public companies. And the reality is 10 represents 35% of the S&P 500 and unique concentration to 2 or 3 companies. \n Investors are already looking to their fixed income bucket, which historically has been off limits, and starting to ask questions about what is the difference between public and private? If both are safe and risky, this is just a question of liquidity trade-off. And liquidity trade-off is actually getting much, much closer. Liquidity in publicly traded fixed income is at record lows. Liquidity for private credit is actually increasing daily. \n We are not -- I'm not saying that we're going to pass each other, but the notion that investors will begin to allocate to private markets, an entire asset bucket that they have not historically allocated to private markets, presents our entire industry with just an unusual path toward extreme growth. \n I believe the same will happen in the equity bucket. An investor who wants exposure to the economy used to get it in public markets. Now more than half the economy is in private markets. While that allocation may not be to private equity, private equity being a product, a 10-year locked-up fund seeking very high rates of return with leverage. I believe investors increasingly will seek out equity exposure in private markets in other forms that exist today. And it is our job, as in our industry, to create the products for the future to allow investors to access 100% of the economy, given that it is no longer in public markets. \n For us to succeed, this is not really a question of opportunity, this is a question of execution. Execution starts with origination. We can only grow our business as fast as we can originate. As you heard, $40 billion for the quarter. We have discussed publicly $125 billion goal of origination for the year. Our original 5-year plan had us getting to $150 billion by 2026, which I hope we will exceed. And no doubt, Investor Day will exceed $200 million (sic) [ $200 billion ] as our midrange target for where we need to be in origination. Again, growth in our business is limited only by our capacity to eliminate -- to originate good risk. \n The second thing we need to do is to prepare for a change in how capital is formed. Capital -- the change is already happening, given the importance of global wealth to our industry. And we will be one of the successful players in that industry. And we value these relationships and run the business on a long-term basis. \n We are essentially needing to build different ways of communicating with our clients. Historically, as you know, we've raised money from our institutional clients out of their alternatives bucket. And increasingly, we will need to cover their fixed income bucket and eventually their equity bucket. I believe we are well positioned to do this, and this is coming at a good time for us and for our industry. \n And also if one steps back and thinks about where capital need is in the world, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's energy transition or whether it is to adapt to new technologies of data centers and the need for power, all three of those things represent long-term financing. \n I do not believe that long-term financing is well suited to the shorter-nature balance sheets of the banking system nor to the daily liquid fund market. Increasingly, these long-term capital needs will be matched with long-term funding from our retail and institutional clients. \n So again, number one, origination; number two, capital formation; and finally, product development, particularly in equity. \n The migration of the fixed income bucket to private markets is already happening, and it's happening faster than I thought. In some ways, we expect that because there are signposts there. Rating agencies rate things in public markets and private markets. And so investors, as they begin to think about this transition, can look to credit ratings and others as a sign of comparability between public market and private market risk. \n Equity markets lack the same sort of signposts. It is up to us as an industry to develop those kinds of products, and I'm excited about what the future looks like, not just in transition in the credit bucket but also in the equity bucket. \n In summary, I like the hand we're playing. We are incredibly well positioned in Retirement Services with a decade-long lead over most of our competition. The work we have done on fixed income replacement and private investment grade, I believe, is particularly well suited for the transition that is taking place as institutions and individuals migrate their historically 100% public fixed income exposure to public and private. And I believe we are well positioned with our hybrid business to begin to address the migration that I expect to take place in equity. \n Jim, over to you. I don't -- thanks for the question. I don't think any of the above. I want to come back to and I guess maybe be a little bit of an outlook for the industry. Our industry has amazing potential. The case for private markets is a very compelling case. People used to look to private markets for excess return. Now they look to excess -- to private markets for both excess return and diversification. \n I saw a note the other day from our Chief Economist, better than 80% of employment in the U.S. is in private markets. We think about S&P 500. We think about public markets. We spend so much time talking about them. But investors increasingly are now recognizing that they have exposure to a very small sliver of the economy through S&P 500. They're all -- my joke is they're all levered to NVIDIA, Apple and Amazon. \n So I expect there to be very robust growth in private markets. All good. The lockdown -- we, as an industry, have to be very careful to stick to our promise of excess return per unit of risk. That is why investors pay us premium fees. That is why they trust us. This is how they navigate private markets, with firms they trust. \n We are limited, and I believe we will all in the industry discover, we are not going to be limited by capital flows. But the taking of capital because you can take it and then investing it poorly is a quick way to destroy a business. I think we've seen lots of examples of that and the beginnings of those seeds being set. We are very focused on growing our business in the context of excess return per unit of risk, which is limited, in my opinion, by origination and by culture. We are balancing those two things. \n And so -- well, I'll say it differently. I like the position we're in. To be a $670 billion asset manager sounds like a big number, but the reality is, in the scheme of the markets we serve, we're minimal. The notion of doubling our business over the next 5 years, it doesn't seem all that daunting. \n The things we need to do: Origination, culture, education because to build something that's not sustainable is not what we're interested in doing. Sustainable, predictable, 15% to 20%; long term in the asset management business; low double digits in SRE. If we get periods of market volatility where things are really mispriced and we can put large amounts of capital to work, as historically we've seen at least once a decade if not twice a decade over the past few decades, you will see those accelerate. Origination, origination, origination for us. Thanks, Ben. It's Marc. The business is a 2-sided business, and I've said this a lot. And it's -- we've been the only ones disclosing this. So it's been difficult, I believe, for analysts to really understand it. \n Our business is about creating spread. If we don't have wide spreads, we're not interested in doing business. We have better uses for the capital. And so we have built, and Jim has spent a lot of time talking about the asset pipeline, private investment grade, excess spread on the asset side. I'll focus now on the liability side and get to your question. \n We have built, over the past 15 years 4, different channels in which we can originate. In various periods of time, some of those channels are really attractive and some of them are not that attractive. Last year, FABN was not all that attractive. This year, FABN is very attractive. Reinsurance, particularly international insurance in -- from Japan, really attractive business. FIA, really attractive business. \n In PRT, PRT was one of the most attractive segments of business last year. This year, prior to any lawsuits, we saw cost of funds associated with PRT at levels that reduced spread to places where we just didn't think the business was all that attractive. A win is only a win if you have wide spread. \n The lawsuit is actually going to, in my opinion, chill PRT volume across the industry. This is not an Athene-specific issue. Athene is the strongest of the companies in the industry with the most capital and other things. There are and have been other lawsuits relating to this. Any time you have noise, however undeserved or poorly drafted, it needs to be disposed of first. \n I think we will see a decline in expected PRT volume this year. I'm not sure that's a bad thing from our point of view given that, at the moment, spreads in PRT are not all that attractive. \n I encourage all of you to look not so much at flow, but to look at cost of funds and spread. Cost of funds is a very tricky measure. There are lots of ways management teams across industries have been surprised by the cost of various options and features that they have built into their products. \n For us, we have built this business in partnership with Jim Belardi and Grant and the team from the very get-go. As owners, for owners, it's our equity. We want high-spread business. Thank you. So first, I've said this publicly, and it's actually kind of an interesting observation for how this goes. I think when I think -- I'm asked often who our best competitors are, I think MassMutual is our best competitor. I look at what they do on the asset side. I look at their -- on the liability side, the quality of the team. \n That does not in any way mean that we should not be partners with them. We want and we continue to deliver this message, and it is resonating. We want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. They are a like-minded, high-quality financial institution who sees the same opportunity that we see and increasingly what the rest of the industry is seeing. They're just among the first movers. \n As to the specifics for ATLAS, I'll let Jim delve a little bit. And I know there's a lot of enthusiasm about ATLAS. Yes. I'm going to just punctuate this a little bit, especially given the environment we're in and the concerns over credit quality. We've been in this business a long time. And for me, this is -- for Jim and I, it's our 40th year. It's hard to believe that sometimes. \n And I'll just take ADS as an example. We run ADS at 100% first lien. And we run ADS, I believe, with the lowest leverage in the industry. Could we produce higher rate of return, higher dividend? Of course we could. But we know that particularly as we're introducing an entire marketplace, institutional and retail, to the notion of private markets, that they should experience the same way -- this is the same way that the smartest institutions in the world have experienced it and not have returns artificially manufactured through leverage or otherwise. The time to be levered is when assets are really cheap and they're plentiful and available. The time not to be levered is when markets are tight and there's lots of liquidity. \n It's easy to be seduced into wanting to produce high returns. We've always been focused on trying to produce acceptable returns, excess return per unit of risk. And the same philosophy that we run ADS and the team runs ADS by is how we're going to produce this in asset-backed to make sure this category, which should be as large as corporate over time, is introduced to investors in the best possible way. And going first and telling the story is exactly what we want to do."
